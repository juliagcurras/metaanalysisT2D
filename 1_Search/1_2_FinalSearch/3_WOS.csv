Dapagliflozin is a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) that improves the insulin sensitivity of the liver and peripheral tissues. Many studies confirmed that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce blood glucose and have multiple beneficial effects such as weight loss, lipid regulation, and kidney protection. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of the renal and cardiovascular protective effects of dapagliflozin from the perspective of differentially expressed proteins in the serum of T2DM patients have not been intensively explored so far.& nbsp;AIM & nbsp;To identify differentially expressed proteins associated with dapagliflozin treatment in patients with T2DM.& nbsp;METHODS & nbsp;Twenty T2DM patients [hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 7.0%-10.0%] were enrolled at The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University between January 1, 2017 and December 1, 2018. They received dapagliflozin (10 mg/d) for 3 mo, and the HbA1c < 7.0% target was achieved. The changes in clinical indexes were compared before and after treatments. Label-free quantitative proteomics was used to identify differentially expressed proteins using the serum samples of five patients. The identified differentially expressed proteins were analyzed using various bioinformatics tools.& nbsp;RESULTS & nbsp;Dapagliflozin significantly improved the clinical manifestation of the patients. There were 18 downregulated proteins and one upregulated protein in the serum samples of patients after dapagliflozin administration. Bioinformatics analyses, including subcellular localization, EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotations, were used to profile the biological characteristics of the 19 differentially expressed proteins. Based on the literature and function enrichment analysis, two downregulated proteins, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and alpha II B integrin (ITGA2B), and one upregulated protein, podocalyxin (PCX), were selected for enzyme linked immunosorbent assay validation. These validated differentially expressed proteins had multiple correlations with clinical indexes, including HbAc1 and fasting C-peptide.& nbsp;CONCLUSION & nbsp;Dapagliflozin has hypoglycemic effects and regulates the serum expressions of MPO, ITGA2B, and PCX, possibly contributing to the effects of dapagliflozin on oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and lipid metabolism.";;"Inner Mongolia Medical University; Inner Mongolia Medical University";;;;;;;;;;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;MAR 15;2022;13;3;;;;;224;239;;10.4239/wjd.v13.i3.224;http://dx.doi.org/10.4239/wjd.v13.i3.224;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000799115300007;View Full Record in Web of Science

We exposed a mixture of five OCPs to zebrafish at concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.25, 2.5, and 25 mu g/L for 12 weeks. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were quantitatively identified in female zebrafish livers, and its functional study was conducted. The significantly high glucose and low insulin levels were observed only at 0.05 mu g/L, linking to the different pattern of DEPs than other concentrations. A total of 1082 proteins was quantified, of which 321 proteins formed 6 clusters in protein dynamics analysis. The enriched pathways in cluster 3 showing distinct pattern of DEPs could explain the nonlinear response at 0.05 mu g/L, indicating that OCP mixtures adversely affected proteins associated with mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. We proposed a feasible mechanism that decrease in expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase led to abnormal accumulation of aldehydes, reducing expression of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and resulting in disruption of glucose homeostasis.

Islets from rodent control and animal models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy humans and insulin- and glucagon-producing cell lines have been used. Protein profiling entails separation, differential expression determination, identification and expression analysis. Protein/peptide separation is either gel-based or by chromatography. Differential expression is based on comparison of visualized spots/proteins between gels or by sample labelling in gel-free systems. Identification of proteins is made by tryptic fragmentation of proteins, fragment mass determination and mass comparison with protein databases. Analysis of expression data sets interprets the complex protein changes into cellular mechanisms to generate hypotheses. The importance of such protein expression sets to elucidate islet cellular events is evidenced by the observation that only about 50% of the differentially expressed proteins and transcripts showed concordance when measured in parallel. Using protein profiling, different areas related to islet dysfunction in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus have been addressed, including dysfunction induced by elevated levels of glucose and fatty acids and cytokines. Because islets from individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus have not yet been protein profiled, islets from rat (BB-DP) and mouse (NOD, ob/ob, MKR) models of the disease have been used, and mechanisms responsible for islet dysfunction delineated offering avenues of intervention.;;Uppsala University;;;;;;;;;;4;6;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2009;11;;;4;;;97;117;;10.1111/j.1463-1326.2009.01111.x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2009.01111.x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000270613000012;View Full Record in Web of Science

Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) is an effective surgery for treating T2DM with beneficial effects on beta cell metabolism. However, the mechanism of how RYGB affects the pancreas, is not clear. We focused on metabolic changes in the pancreas of rats following RYGBand to investigate complex postoperative pancreatic metabolic reprogramming and to understand how RYGB improves islet function. Methods: We performed RYGBonstreptozotocin-induced male T2DM rats. Then we measured indicators such as weight, fasting GLU, etc. After 10 weeks, pancreatic tissues were removed to identify and quantify differentially expressed proteins. Furthermore, functional analysis of these proteins and their associated pathways was conducted by bioinformatics methods. Results: After surgery, 451 differentially expressed proteins associated with the mechanism ofRYGB were identified. Protein levels of regenerating islet-derived protein 3 (Reg3A), cell division cycle-associated protein 2 (CDCA2), and ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) varied greatly, and Arf1 may be a point target in diabetes. Conclusion and clinical relevance: This research shows that RYGB could treat T2DM through changes in the pancreatic proteins. It will give some new insight into the molecular mechanism behind the effect of RYGB.;;Central South University;;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;;2021;18;4;;;;;480;490;;10.2174/1570164617999201116153530;http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1570164617999201116153530;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000685511300005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Declining and even insufficient insulin levels were observed in obese adolescents with high levels of the fatty acid. In isolated human islets exposed to palmitate we have observed insulin hypersecretion after 2 days exposure. In contrast, insulin secretion from the islets was reduced after 7 days culture in the presence of the fatty acid. This study aims at identifying islet-related biological events potentially linked with the observed insulin hypersecretion and later secretory decline in these obese children and adolescents using the islet model. We analyzed protein expression data obtained from human islets exposed to elevated palmitate levels for 2 and 7 days by an improved methodology for statistical analysis of differentially expressed proteins. Protein profiling of islet samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified 115 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Several DEPs including sorcin were associated with increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets after 2 days of exposure to palmitate. Similarly, several metabolic pathways including altered protein degradation, increased autophagy, altered redox condition, and hampered insulin processing were coupled to the functional impairment of islets after 7 days of culture in the presence of palmitate. Such biological events, once validated in the islets, may give rise to novel treatment strategies aiming at normalizing insulin levels in obese children with high palmitate levels, which may reduce or even prevent obesity-related type 2 diabetes mellitus.;;"Uppsala University; University of Geneva; University of Luxembourg";;;;;;;;;;11;11;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2018;17;11;;;;;3824;3836;;10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00239;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00239;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000449443000020;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to identify plasma exosome differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that are potentially involved in the development of obesity-related T2DM.Methods: Exosomes were isolated from the plasma of obese and non-obese T2DM patients (n = 10 for each group). A label-free quantitative mass spectrometry analysis was applied to identify plasma exosome DEPs in obese patients compared with non-obese patients, followed by bioinformatics analysis including GO annotation, KEGG analysis, subcellular localization prediction, transcrip-tion factor analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction.Results: We identified 2 significantly upregulated proteins (C9 and PON1) and 5 significantly downregulated proteins (HPX, A1BG, CFHR1, ANG, and CALM) in obese patients compared with those in non-obese patients. KEGG analysis demonstrated that the insulin signaling pathway was one of the pathways that significantly correlated with the DEPs. The DEPs were primarily localized in the extracellular space (5 out of 7). HMG-box and NF-Y beta might regulate the transcription of the DEPs. C9, PON1, HPX, and CFHR1 were present in the PPI network.Conclusion: The plasma exosome DEPs are potentially responsible for the development of obesity-related T2DM possibly through the insulin signaling pathway and the interaction with other proteins.

Endothelium-Descemet membrane complex tissues were peeled from transplant suitable donor corneas. Protein fractions were isolated from each sample and subjected to multidimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Peptide spectra were matched to the human proteome, assigned gene ontology, and grouped into protein signaling pathways unique to each of the disease states. We identified an average of 12,472 unique proteins in each of the endothelium-Descemet membrane complex tissue samples. There were 2,409 differentially expressed protein isoforms that included previously known risk factors for type II diabetes mellitus related to metabolic processes, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that diabetes progression has many protein footprints related to metabolic processes, binding, and catalysis. The most represented pathways involved in diabetes progression included mitochondrial dysfunction, cell-cell junction structure, and protein synthesis regulation. This proteomic dataset identifies novel corneal endothelial cell and Descemet membrane protein expression in various stages of diabetic disease. These findings give insight into the mechanisms involved in diabetes progression relevant to the corneal endothelium and its basement membrane, prioritize new pathways for therapeutic targeting, and provide insight into potential biomarkers for determining the health of this tissue.;;"University of Iowa; University of Iowa";;;;;;;;;;20;22;;;;;;;;;;;MAR 12;2018;13;3;;;;;;;e0192287;10.1371/journal.pone.0192287;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0192287;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000427189300003;View Full Record in Web of Science

We screened and selected spontaneously obese and diabetic rhesus monkeys and examined altered protein expression in skeletal muscle of healthy aging (CON), obesity aging (OB), and type 2 diabetes mellitus aging (T2D) rhesus monkeys using Tandem Mass Tags (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic analysis. In total, we identified 142 differentially expressed proteins. Muscle-nerve communication proteins were firstly suppressed at obese-stage. With the disintegration of skeletal muscle, mitochondrial complex I and other energy homeostasis relate proteins were significantly disordered at T2D stage. Indicating that aging related obesity suppressed muscle-nerve communication and contribute to T2D related functional deterioration of skeletal muscles in elderly rhesus monkeys. Some alterations of muscular functional regulator are detected in both obesity and T2D samples, suggesting some T2D related skeletal muscular hypofunctions are occurring at obesity or pre-obesity stage.

The aim of the present study was to explore the effects of silybin on protein expression in obese mice. Firstly, serum was collected, and it was used to detect serum lipids and other serological indicators. Secondly, total protein from epididymal adipose tissue was extracted for differential expression analysis by quantitative tandem mass tag (TMT) combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), followed by bioinformatics and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses of these proteins. Lastly, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) were used to further validate the expression of identified differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) at the mRNA and protein level, respectively. The results revealed that silybin could improve abnormal lipid metabolism caused by the high fat diet in obese mice. A total of 341, 538 and 243 DEPs were found in the high fat/control (WF/WC), silybin/high fat (WS/WF) and WS/WC groups, respectively. These DEPs mainly participated in lipid metabolism and energy metabolism. Notably, tropomyosin 1 (TPM1), myosin light chain 2 (MYL2), myosin heavy chain 11 (MYH11) and other DEPs were involved in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy and other pathways.

Here, we present a study of a STZ rhesus macaque model of T2DM that utilizes quantitative iTRAQ-based proteomic method. We compared the protein profiles in the liver of STZ-treated macaques as well as age-matched healthy controls. We identified 171 proteins differentially expressed in the STZ-treated groups, about 70 of which were documented as diabetes-related gene in previous studies. Pathway analyses indicated that the biological functions of differentially expressed proteins were related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, complements, and coagulation cascades. Expression change in tryptophan metabolism pathway was also found in this study which may be associations with diabetes.

Subsequently, 31 spots with >= 2-fold change in their expression were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry leading to the identification of 11 proteins with average sequence coverage of similar to 38%. The expression of apolipoprotein A-1 was reduced by 4.2-fold, and galectin-1 was increased 4.8 times in diabetic samples. Induction of galectin-1 in T2D samples was confirmed by ELISA. In addition, the dose-dependent treatment of rat L6 skeletal muscle cells with glucose resulted in an upregulation of galectin-1. These data implicate the association of galectin-1 with the pathophysiology of diabetes and identify galectin-1 as a novel diagnostic marker protein in T2D patients.;;"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Institute of Basic Medical Sciences - CAMS; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College; Mayo Clinic; Lanzhou University; Humboldt University of Berlin";;;;;;;;;;39;42;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2009;8;3;;;;;1255;1262;;10.1021/pr800850a;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr800850a;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000264035000015;View Full Record in Web of Science

Current diagnostic methods rely on blood glucose measurements, which are noninformative with respect to progression of the disease to other associated pathologies. Thus, predicting the risk and development of T2DM-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease, remains a major challenge. We have used a combination of quantitative methods for characterization of circulating serum biomarkers of T2DM using a cohort of nondiabetic control subjects (n = 76) and patients diagnosed with T2DM (n = 106). In this case control study, the samples were randomly divided as training and validation data sets. In the first step, iTRAQ (isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification) based protein expression profiling was performed for identification of proteins displaying a significant differential expression in the two study groups. Five of these protein markers were selected for validation using multiple reaction-monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) and further confirmed with Western blot and QPCR analysis. Functional pathway analysis identified perturbations in lipid and small molecule metabolism as well as pathways that lead to disruption of glucose homeostasis and blood coagulation. These putative biomarkers may be clinically useful for subset stratification of T2DM patients as well as for the development of novel therapeutics targeting the specific pathology.;;"Georgetown University; Qatar University; Hamad Medical Corporation; Waters Corporation; Howard University";;;;;;;;;;62;63;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2012;11;11;;;;;5527;5539;;10.1021/pr300798z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr300798z;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000311190600035;View Full Record in Web of Science

Histopathological changes, fibrosis, and protein expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), and ATP5b were obviously observed in the kidneys of db/db diabetic mice as compared with the control db/m(+) mice. The increased ATP5b expression was majorly observed in diabetic renal tubules and was notably observed to locate in cytoplasm of tubule cells, but no significant increase of ATP5b in diabetic glomeruli. AGEs significantly increased protein expression of ATP5b and fibrotic factors and decreased ATP content in cultured renal tubular cells via an AGEs-receptor for AGEs (RAGE) axis pathway. Oxidative stress was also induced in diabetic kidneys and AGEs-treated renal tubular cells. The increase of ATP5b and CTGF protein expression in AGEs-treated renal tubular cells was reversed by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. ATP5b-siRNA transfection augmented the increased protein expression of alpha-SMA and CTGF and CTGF promoter activity in AGEs-treated renal tubular cells. The in vivo ATP5b-siRNA delivery significantly enhanced renal fibrosis and serum creatinine in db/db mice with ATP5b down-regulation. These findings suggest that increased ATP5b plays an important adaptive or protective role in decreasing the rate of AGEs-induced renal fibrosis during diabetic condition.;;"National Taiwan University; National Chung Hsing University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University Hospital; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University Hospital; National Taiwan University; China Medical University Taiwan; China Medical University Hospital - Taiwan; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University Hospital";;;;;;;;;;24;27;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 9;2015;5;;;;;;;;14561;10.1038/srep14561;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep14561;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000362477300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Patients had been taking ASA (100 mg day) and they were randomized to receive (n = 29) or not (n = 28) 75 mg day clopidogrel for 12 +/- 2 weeks in a blind form. Protein expression was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The protein expression of a limited number of proteins such as actin-binding protein isotypes 2 and 5, lactate dehydrogenase, serotransferrin isotype 4, protein disulfide isomerase-A3 isotype 1, fibrinogen beta chain isotype 5, Ras-related protein Rab-7b isotypes 1 and 6, and immunoglobulin heavy chain was changed after dual antiplatelet therapy. Plasma level of platelet factor 4 (PF4), an in vivo marker of platelet activity, was not different between both groups. These changes suggest lower platelet reactivity after dual antiplatelet therapy in the studied patients. However, the variation in platelet proteome was lower than it would be initially expected, taking into account the apparent clinical beneficial effects of dual antiplatelet therapy. PF4 plasma level was not further decreased in the platelets treated for a longer time than 912 months with ASA + clopidogrel, as compared with ASA alone.

Our previous in vivo and in vitro studies revealed MET's inhibitory effect on ovarian cancer, with the synergistic effects of MET and the MDM2 inhibitor RG7388 contributing to ovarian cancer treatment. This study further explores the mechanism underlying MET's inhibition of ovarian cancer.Materials and Methods:Following MET treatment, we analyzed the differentially expressed proteins in ovarian cancer cells using a tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomic approach coupled with bioinformatics.Results:Using A2780 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells, we identified six upregulated and two downregulated proteins after MET treatment. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these proteins predominately affect ovarian cancer cells by regulating iron ion transport, iron ion homeostasis, and mitochondrial and ribosomal functions. Validation via western blot confirmed MET-induced elevation of hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase type 2 (BDH2) protein expression levels in A2780 and SKOV3 cells.Conclusions:Overall, our findings suggest that combining MET with other metabolic drugs, such as iron-chelating agents and mitochondrial inhibitors, may result in synergistic antitumor effects, thereby offering novel avenues for ovarian cancer treatment development.";;"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; University of Jinan; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;AUG;2024;20;4;;;;;1293;1299;;10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_2449_23;http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_2449_23;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001306745500009;View Full Record in Web of Science

We adapted the SCoPE method from single-cell proteomics to pericardial fluid, where a myocardial tissue carrier was used to aid protein quantification. The carrier proteome and patient samples were labeled with distinct isobaric labels, which allowed separate quantification. Undepleted pericardial fluid from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or heart failure undergoing heart surgery was analyzed with either a traditional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method or with the carrier proteome. In total, 1398 proteins were quantified with a carrier, compared to 265 without, and a higher proportion of these proteins were of myocardial origin. The number of differentially expressed proteins also increased nearly four-fold. For patients with both heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus, pathway analysis of upregulated proteins demonstrated the enrichment of immune activation, blood coagulation, and stress pathways. Overall, our work demonstrates the applicability of a carrier for enhanced protein quantification in challenging biological matrices such as pericardial fluid, with potential applications for biomarker discovery.

Methods: We used a Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics approach to identify proteins with potential molecular mechanisms associated with acupuncture interventions for T2DM with NAFLD. Results: Acupuncture effectively improved body weight, blood glucose, and insulin levels in T2DM with NAFLD mouse models and reversed steatosis within hepatocytes. Quantitative TMT-based proteomics analysis identified a total of 4710 quantifiable proteins and 1226 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the model control group (MCG) compared with the normal control group (NCG). The Acupuncture Treatment Group (ATG) presented in 122 DEPs was compared with the MCG group. We performed a bioinformatics analysis, which revealed that DEPs enriched in the KEGG pathway after acupuncture treatment were mainly involved in the PPAR signaling pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid elongation, fat digestion and absorption. We used parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) technology to explore the association of aldehyde oxidase 1 (Aox1), acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 2 (Acot2), perilipin-2 (Plin2), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (Acc), NADP-dependent malic enzyme (Me1), fatty acid synthase (Fasn), ATP-citrate synthase (Acly), fatty acid-binding protein, intestinal (Fabp2) with lipid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, and hepatocyte steatosis.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex and polygenic disease with increasing global prevalence and economic burden. In this study, the hypoglycemic effect of avicularin (quercetin-3-0-alpha-arabinofuranoside), a flavonoid glycoside commonly found in natural plants and fruits, was determined in a high fat diet/streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetes mouse model. Our results demonstrated that dietary avicularin treatment reduced levels of fasting blood glucose, serum TG and LDL-C, liver AST and ALT, and increased hepatic glycogen in T2DM mice. Furthermore, we used RNA-Seq and iTRAQ to compare the gene and protein expression in the livers of the normal control mice (NC), diabetic control mice (DC) and avicularin treated mice (DA100). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were analyzed based on gene annotations and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Integrated analysis of the RNA-Seq and iTRAQ data indicated that the fifteen DEGs/DEPs showed the same trend in mRNA and protein expression levels in comparisons of both NC vs DC and DC vs DA100. KEGG analysis revealed that four DEGs/DEPs (PKM, PEPCK, PYG, and PLA2) in the glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and arachidonic acid pathway, and six DEPs (Ndufb4, Ndufa6, Cox5a, Cox5b, Cox6c, and ATPS beta) in the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, play important roles in avicularin's hypoglycemic effect. We also found six other DEGs/DEPs related to T2DM (CA1, Serpinb6a, AK, Pcolce, Cand2, and Atp2a3), and five related to cancer (Phgdh, Tes, Papss1, Psat1, and Fam49b). We did further verify by qRT-PCR and explored the possible binding modes of avicularin with targeted proteins with molecular docking simulations.

However, little is known about the relationship between HUA and these diseases on the protein level. We performed label-free liquid chromatography MS/MS spectrometry analysis of urine samples from 26 HUA patients and 25 healthy controls, attempting to establish the possible protein links between HUA and these diseases by profiling urine proteome. A total of 2119 proteins were characterized in sample proteomes. Among them, 11 were found decreased and 2 were found increased in HUA samples. Plausible pathways found by enrichment analysis of these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) include the processes for insulin receptor recycling and lipid metabolism, suggesting potential links between HUA and T2DM and hyperlipidemia. The abundance changes of three key proteins (VATB1, CFAD, and APOC3) involved in these processes were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In conclusion, our result provides proteomic evidence, for the first time, that the aberrant pathways enriched by described key DEPs are closely related to the incidence of HUA and its concomitant diseases.;;"Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine; Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine; Zhengzhou University; Hebei University; Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine; Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine; Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine; Macau University of Science & Technology";;;;;;;;;;6;8;;;;;;;;;;;APR 13;2021;6;14;;;;;9500;9508;;10.1021/acsomega.0c06229;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.0c06229;;MAR 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000640649500019;View Full Record in Web of Science

Sweet corncob polysaccharide (SCP-80-I) is a bioactive macromolecule extracted from the sweet corncob. Previous studies have shown that SCP-80-I has beneficial biological activities, including anti-oxidative and hypoglycemic properties. Previously, we showed that SCP-80-I had hypoglycemic effects, but the overall molecular changes associated with SCP-80-I have not yet been clarified in vivo. In this study, we investigated the hypoglycemic effects of SCP-80-I in diabetic rats with insulin resistance and analyzed the hypoglycemic mechanisms of SCP-80I using tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled quantitative proteomics. Using gene onotology (GO) annotations and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, the biological process, cell composition, and molecular function terms associated with the differentially expressed proteins were identified, as were the associated signaling pathways. In total, 4780 proteins exhibited a fold-change greater than 1.5. Six differentially expressed proteins related to the development and treatment of diabetes were selected, encoded by the genes Pik3r5, Ndufb3, Pygl, Cbl, Prkcd, and Stat1. SCP-80-I induced hypoglycemia mainly through the PI3K-Akt and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. SCP-80-I also ameliorated diabetes by regulating the expression of the Pik3r5, Ndufb3, Pygl, Cbl, Prkcd, and Stat1 genes. This study provided a theoretical basis for the treatment of diabetes and the development of hypoglycemic drugs.

Results: GO functional analysis found 153 differentially expressed proteins between DMOA and OA groups, of which 92 differentially expressed proteins were significantly up-regulated and 61 were significantly down-regulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway analysis found 180 pathways, including 9 pathways significantly enriched. Further data analysis revealed that 6 signaling pathways were closely associated with T2DM and OA. Conclusion: OA and DMOA onset and progression were closely related to synthesis and metabolism of extracellular matrix components (e.g., fibronectin, decorin, etc.). The effects of T2DM on OA occur though 2 major ways of oxidative stress and low-grade chronic inflammation, involving in 2 inhibited signaling pathways and 4 activated signaling pathways.;;"Nanjing Tech University; Nanjing Tech University; Nanjing Medical University; Nanjing Medical University";;;;;;;;;;2;2;;;;;;;;;;;FEB 4;2022;101;5;;;;;;;e28738;10.1097/MD.0000000000028738;http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000028738;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000750992000031;View Full Record in Web of Science

Utilizing integrative proteomic analysis, this study aimed to identify a panel of potential protein markers for T2DM, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and paving the way for personalized treatment strategies.MethodsProteome profiles from two independent cohorts were integrated: cohort 1 composed of 10 T2DM patients and 10 healthy controls (HC), and cohort 2 comprising 87 T2DM patients and 60 healthy controls. Differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and classification error matrix analysis were employed.ResultsComparative proteomic analysis identified the differential expressed proteins (DEPs) and changes in biological pathways associated with T2DM. Further combined analysis refined a group of protein panel (including CA1, S100A6, and DDT), which were significantly increased in T2DM in both two cohorts. ROC analysis revealed the area under curve (AUC) values of 0.94 for CA1, 0.87 for S100A6, and 0.97 for DDT; the combined model achieved an AUC reaching 1. Classification error matrix analysis demonstrated the combined model could reach an accuracy of 1 and 0.875 in the 60% training set and 40% testing set.ConclusionsThis study incorporates different cohorts of T2DM, and refines the potential markers for T2DM with high accuracy, offering more reliable markers for clinical translation.";;"Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine; Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine; Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;JAN 22;2025;24;1;;;;;;;55;10.1007/s40200-025-01562-3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40200-025-01562-3;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001402113200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study provides insight into the system-level hypoglycemic mechanisms of F31 by the integrative analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics data. To explore the omics perspective for the mechanisms of action, the protein and gene expression in the liver from the normal control (NC), diabetic db/db control mice (DC) and F31-treated db/db mice (F31) were analyzed by iTRAQ and RNA-Seq. The differential expression proteins (DEPs) and differential expression genes (DEGs) were analyzed based on their gene ontology (GO) annotations and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, and the expression of DEGs and DEPs was verified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting (WB). We identified sixty-five DEGs and sixty-two DEPs in the F31-treated group as compared with the DC. Integrated analysis of the RNA-Seq data and proteomics data indicated that the two DEGs/DEPsGck [glucokinase (GCK)] and Cyp4a12a [cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily a, polypeptide 12a (CYP4A12A)]showed the same trend in mRNA and protein expression levels in the comparison of F31-VS-DC. KEGG analysis revealed that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) signaling pathway was enriched in both of the comparisons of NC-VS-DC and F31-VS-DC at the protein expression level. In the analysis of the gene and protein expression of candidate proteins targeting diabetes, we found that three genes [Gck, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)] and three proteins [GCK, glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2), pyruvate kinase (PYK) ] in the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways, proteins of the Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) in the insulin pathway, and two genes [Cyp4a12a and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 (SCD2)] in the lipid metabolism were expressed significantly differently in the F31-treated group as compared with the DC group, which played important roles in the hypoglycemic activity of F31. Cluster analysis demonstrated that microRNAs probably participated in the regulation of the genes involved the glucose metabolism. These results provide theoretical evidence for F31 as a potential functional food ingredient for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.;;"Guangdong Academy of Sciences; Institute of Microbiology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences";;;;;;;;;;32;34;;;;;;;;;;;DEC 1;2018;9;12;;;;;6496;6508;;10.1039/c8fo01656a;http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8fo01656a;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000453244900038;View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of the present study was to investigate variations in plasma protein levels in subjects with T2DM and differences in beta-cell function, characterized by the EIR (early insulin response), and to compare these protein levels with those observed in individuals with NGT (normal glucose tolerance). Ten subjects with NGT + high EIR, ten with T2DM + high EIR, and ten with T2DM + low EIR were selected from the community-based ULSAM (Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men) cohort. Plasma protein profiling was performed using SELDI-TOF (surface-enhanced laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight) MS. In total, nine plasma proteins differed between the three study groups (P < 0.05, as determined by ANOVA). The levels of two forms of transthyretin, haemoglobin alpha-chain and haemoglobin beta-chain were decreased in plasma from subjects with T2DM compared with subjects with NGT irrespective of the EIR of the subjects. Apolipoprotein H was decreased in plasma from individuals with T2DM + high EIR compared with subjects with NGT Four additional unidentified plasma proteins also varied in different ways between the experimental groups.

Animals were divided into eight groups as: control (con), diabetes (Dia), crocin (Cro), voluntary exercise (Exe), crocin and voluntary exercise (Cro-Exe), diabetic-crocin (Dia-Cro), diabetic-voluntary exercise (Dia-Exe), diabetic-crocin-voluntary exercise (Dia-Cro-Exe). Type 2 diabetes was induced by a high-fat diet (4 weeks) and injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (i.p, 35 mg/kg). Animals received oral administration of crocin (50 mg/kg) or performed voluntary exercise alone or together for 8 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed on overnight fasted control, diabetic and treated rats after 8 weeks of treatment. Then, serum insulin and heart VEGF-A protein levels were measured. Crocin combined with voluntary exercise significantly decreased blood glucose levels (p < 0.001) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p < 0.001) compared to diabetic group. VEGF-A level was significantly (p < 0.01) lower in Dia group compared to control group. The combination of crocin and voluntary exercise significantly enhanced VEGF-A protein levels in Dia-Cro-Exe and Cro-Exe group compared to diabetic and control groups, respectively; p < 0.001 and p < 0.05. Crocin combined with voluntary exercise improved insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and reduced glucose levels in diabetic rats.

Metformin, a widely known anti-diabetic drug, used for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, is also claimed to be useful in treatment of NAFLD. However, both the clinical efficacy and the putative mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of metformin in treating NAFLD are unclear. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the primary molecular target for metformin, is a known regulator of mitochondrial function. Thus, we used a proteomic approach to investigate the effect of metformin on liver mitochondria of apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE(-/-)) mice, an animal model of NAFLD. Two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry was applied to study the changes in liver mitochondrial protein expression in 6-month old metformin-treated apoE(-/-) mice as compared to non-treated animals. Collectively, 25 differentially expressed proteins were indentified upon metformin treatment including proteins related to metabolism, oxidative stress and cellular respiration. The most up-regulated protein was glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) - an enzyme, whose deficiency was shown to be directly related to the development of NAFLD. Our results clearly point to the strong mitochondrial action of metformin in NAFLD. Up-regulation of GNMT may represent an important mechanism of beneficial action of metforrnin in NAFLD treatment.

Patient with T2D is at higher risk for developing acute or chronic pancreatitis. Prolonged hyperglycemia results in damages to tissue, which also causes dysfunctions of some organ systems, including enzyme or hormone secretions. Commonly, dysfunction or insufficiency of pancreatic exocrine is evaluated by increasing activity of serum pancreatic enzyme, such as amylase and lipase. Although incidence of pancreatitis was found in Indonesian T2D, the pathogenic mechanism still unclear. The aim of this study was to characterize the marker protein that indicated the correlation of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency with progression of T2D. Proteomic analysis using LC-MS/MS was used in identification and characterization of protein marker which indicates insufficiency pancreatic exocrine. First step, protein profile was analyzed by SDS-PAGE methods using serum sample of T2D compared with normal or healthy control, as negative control, and pancreatitis patients, as positive control. Protein with 18 kDa was found as a candidate protein marker which indicated the pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in T2D. The further identification of that protein using LC-MS/MS showed 4 peptide fragments.

Human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic beta-cells, plays dual roles in both glycemic control and the pathology of type 2 diabetes. While IAPP can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and modulate cellular autophagy, apoptosis and extracellular matrix metabolism, no data is available concerning intracellular protein expression upon exposure to the polypeptide. More surprisingly, how intracellular protein expression is modulated by nanoparticle inhibitors of protein aggregation remains entirely unknown. In this study, we first examined the changing proteomes of beta TC6, a pancreatic beta-cell line, upon exposure to monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar IAPP, and detailed cellular protein expression rescued by graphene quantum dots (GQDs), an IAPP inhibitor. We found that 29 proteins were significantly dysregulated by the IAPP species, while majority of these proteins were nucleotide-binding proteins. Collectively, our liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry, fluorescence quenching, helium ion microscopy, cytotoxicity and discreet molecular dynamics simulations data revealed a remarkable capacity of GQDs in regulating aberrant protein expression through H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions, pointing to nanomedicine as a new frontier against human amyloid diseases.;;"Monash University; Ningbo University; Clemson University; China Jiliang University; Monash University; Monash University; University of Queensland";;;;;;;;;;32;33;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2019;12;11;;;;;2827;2834;;10.1007/s12274-019-2520-7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12274-019-2520-7;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000494681100019;View Full Record in Web of Science

Large-scale proteomic studies on animal models of T2DM are of great importance to understand the pathophysiology of T2DM. Therefore, in our study, Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) were used for proteomic analysis of skeletal muscles from T2DM-susceptible and -tolerant Bama mini-pig models induced by a high-fat, high-sugar diet. In our proteomic analysis, a total of 1646 proteins and 13 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified by iTRAQ-mass spectrometry, and 6 differentially expressed proteins were validated by PRM. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that most DEPs were extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and participated in several biological processes, such as negative regulation of JAK-STAT cascade, negative regulation of STAT cascade, roundabout signaling pathway and peptide cross-linking via chondroitin 4-sulfate glycosaminoglycan, and the molecular functions of roundabout binding, glycosaminoglycan binding, heparin binding, sulfur compound binding, collagen binding, and kinase inhibitor activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis results showed that the differentially expressed proteins were involved in 14 pathways, including human disease pathways, metabolic pathways, signal transduction pathways, signaling molecules and interaction pathways, and the cellular process pathways associated with phagosomes and focal adhesion. In conclusion, the proteomics based on iTRAQ and PRM in T2DM-susceptible and -tolerant Bama minipig models showed that changes in amino acid metabolism, inflammation-associated pathways and the impaired function and environment of extracellular matrix are risk factors associated with increased pathogenesis of T2DM in Bama mini-pig.;;"Guangxi University; University of Minnesota System";;;;;;;;;;10;14;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 30;2018;675;;;;;;119;127;;10.1016/j.gene.2018.06.103;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2018.06.103;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000445169900015;View Full Record in Web of Science

AimThe aim of this study is to analyze the systemic effect of PDE5 inhibition in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) determining changes in the expression levels of plasma proteins. MethodsSeventeen patients with controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and ED were included in the study. Patients received vardenafil hydrochloride 20mg on demand during 12weeks. At the beginning and 12weeks after vardenafil administration, plasma samples were collected and analyzed using proteomics. Main Outcome MeasuresInternational Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function Domain (IIEF-EFD) and plasma protein expression before and after vardenafil administration. Nitrate/nitrite release, PDE5, and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) expression and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs). ResultsThe IIEF-EFD score was markedly improved after 12weeks of vardenafil administration. Plasma levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin isotypes 4 and 6 and -tropomyosin were decreased, whereas apolipoprotein AI isoype 5 was increased 12weeks after vardenafil administration. Only -tropomyosin plasma levels were inversely correlated with IIEF-EFD score. Tropomyosin has been added to cultured BAECs and after 24hours reduced the protein expression level of sGC-(1) subunit and decreased the cGMP content. Tropomyosin did not modify PDE5 expression and nitric oxide release in BAECs as compared with control BAECs. Vardenafil (10g/mL) did not modify sGC-(1) subunit expression in tropomyosin+vardenafil-incubated BAECs; however, vardenafil significantly reversed the reduction of cGMP content induced by tropomyosin. ConclusionVardenafil administration improved erectile functionality in controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with ED, which was associated with reduction of circulating plasma -tropomyosin levels. Tropomyosin affected by itself the cGMP generating system suggesting a possible new mechanism involved in ED. Vardenafil reversed the reduction effect of cGMP content elicited by tropomyosin in BAECs.

The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (HIEC) is the gold standard for the assessment of insulin sensitivity (IS). We have previously shown that insulin sensitivity, measured by HIEC, varied widely among a group of 60 young healthy men with normoglycemia. The aim of this study was to correlate the proteomic profile of skeletal muscles to insulin sensitivity. Methods Muscle biopsies from 16 subjects having the highest (M >= 13; n = 8, HIS) and lowest (M 3/4 6, n = 8, LIS) IS were obtained at baseline and during insulin infusion after stabilization of the blood glucose level and glucose infusion rate at the end of the HIEC. The samples were processed using a quantitative proteomic analysis approach. ResultsAt baseline, 924 proteins were identified in the HIS and LIS groups. Among the 924 proteins detected in both groups, three were suppressed and three were increased significantly in the LIS subjects compared with the HIS subjects. Following insulin infusion, 835 proteins were detected in both groups. Among the 835 proteins, two showed differential responsiveness to insulin; ATP5F1 protein was decreased, and MYLK2 was higher in the LIS group compared with that in the HIS group. Our data suggest that alteration in mitochondrial proteins and an increased number of proteins involved in fast-twitch fiber correlate to insulin sensitivity in healthy young Arab men. ConclusionsThese results suggest a change in a small number of differentially expressed proteins. A possible reason for this small change could be our study cohorts representing a homogeneous and healthy population. Additionally, we show differences in protein levels from skeletal muscle in low and high insulin sensitivity groups. Therefore, these differences may represent early events for the development of insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and type 2 diabetes.";;"Hamad Medical Corporation; Hamad Medical Corporation; Rudjer Boskovic Institute; Qatar Foundation (QF); Weill Cornell Medical College Qatar; Anti Doping Laboratory (Qatar)";;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;FEB 17;2023;13;;;;;;;;1024832;10.3389/fendo.2022.1024832;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2022.1024832;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000942805200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Comparing group A with group B, 32 proteins were up-regulated and 18 proteins were down-regulated. Comparing group A with group C, 24 proteins were up-regulated and 24 proteins were down-regulated. Comparing group A with group D, 19 proteins were up-regulated and 17 proteins were down-regulated. The fold change for up-regulated proteins was >1.2, p < 0.05, while the fold change for down-regulated proteins was <-1.2, p < 0.05. PLS-DA and OPLS-DA revealed 113 differentially expressed metabolites. Correlation analysis of differentially expressed metabolites of group A versus group B revealed that among the down-regulated differential proteins, transforming growth factor beta-induced protein ig-h3 correlated negatively with metabolite L-saccharin, while among the up-regulated differential proteins, apolipoprotein C-IV correlated negatively with metabolite 3-methyloxindole. Among all differentially expressed proteins, 19 proteins were associated with early initiation of chronic inflammation, including CD14 and CSF-1R, which were newly identified in the early onset of T2DM. ConclusionsMany proteins are differentially expressed between prediabetes and after T2DM diagnosis, although the specific mechanism remains unclear. The expression level of CD14 was significantly up-regulated and that of CSF-1R was significantly down-regulated when FPG was >= 5.6 mmol/L, suggesting that CD14 and CSF-1R may be important markers for early-onset T2DM and may serve as new targets for T2DM treatment.";;;;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;MAR 15;2023;37;5;;;;;;;e9448;10.1002/rcm.9448;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rcm.9448;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000903769500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dl-PHPB on memory deficits and preliminarily explore the underlying molecular mechanism. Methods Blood glucose and behavioral performance were evaluated in the KK-A(y) diabetic mouse model before and after dl-PHPB administration. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)-based proteomics was used to identify differentially expressed proteins in brain tissue. Western blotting was used to study the molecular mechanism of the related signaling pathways. Results Three-month-old KK-A(y) mice were given 150 mg/kg dl-PHPB by oral gavage for 2 months, which produced no effect on the level of serum glucose. In the Morris water maze test, KK-A(y) mice treated with dl-PHPB showed significant improvements in spatial learning and memory deficits compared with vehicle-treated KK-A(y) mice. Additionally, we performed 2D-DIGE to compare brain proteomes of 5-month KK-A(y) mice treated with and without dl-PHPB. We found 14 altered proteins in the cortex and 11 in the hippocampus; two of the 25 altered proteins and another four proteins that were identified in a previous study on KK-A(y) mice were then validated by western blot to further confirm whether dl-PHPB can reverse the expression levels of these proteins. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta) signaling pathway was also changed in KK-A(y) mice and dl-PHPB treatment could reverse it. Conclusions These results indicate that dl-PHPB may play a potential role in diabetes-associated cognitive impairment through PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta signaling pathway and the differentially expressed proteins may become putative therapeutic targets.";;"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College";;;;;;;;;;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2022;28;7;;;;;1108;1123;;10.1111/cns.13847;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cns.13847;;APR 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000784044800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Although T2DM is primarily a peripheral disorder and AD is a central nervous system disease, both share some common features as they are chronic and complex diseases, and both show involvement of oxidative stress and inflammation in their progression. These characteristics suggest that T2DM may be associated with AD, which gave rise to a new term, type 3 diabetes (T3DM). In this study, we searched for matching peripheral proteomic biomarkers of AD and T2DM based in a systematic review of the available literature. We identified 17 common biomarkers that were differentially expressed in both patients with AD or T2DM when compared with healthy controls. These biomarkers could provide a useful workflow for screening T2DM patients at risk to develop AD.;;"Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais";;;;;;;;;;54;55;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2021;156;6;;;;;753;776;;10.1111/jnc.15166;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jnc.15166;;OCT 2020;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000575626100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: We performed mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative analysis of vitreous proteome of PDR (n = 13) and idiopathic macular hole (IMH; control) subjects (n = 14). Nine samples of PDR and 10 samples of IMH were pooled as case and control, respectively, and compared. Four samples each of PDR and IMH were analyzed individually without pooling to validate the results of the pooled analysis. Comparative quantification was performed using Scaffold software which calculated the fold changes of differential expression. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using DAVID and STRING software. Results: We identified 469 proteins in PDR and 517 proteins in IMH vitreous, with an overlap of 172 proteins. Also, 297 unique proteins were identified in PDR and 345 in IMH. In PDR vitreous, 37 proteins were upregulated (P < 0.05) and 19 proteins were downregulated compared to IMH. Protein distribution analysis clearly demonstrated a separation of protein expression in PDR and IMH. Significantly upregulated proteins included fibrinogen gamma chain, fibrinogen beta chain, and carbonic anhydrase 1 and downregulated proteins included alpha-1-antitrypsin, retinol-binding protein 3, neuroserpin, cystatin C, carboxypeptidase E and cathepsin-D. Conclusion: Diabetic retinopathy pathogenesis involves proteins which belong to inflammation, visual transduction, and extracellular matrix pathways.

We quantified 14 candidate proteins using targeted mass spectrometry in plasma samples of the prospective, population-based German KORA F4/FF4 study (6.5-year follow-up). 892 participants aged 42-81years were selected using a case-cohort design, including 123 persons with incident type 2 diabetes and 255 persons with incident WHO-defined prediabetes. Prospective associations between protein levels and diabetes, prediabetes as well as continuous fasting and 2h glucose, fasting insulin and insulin resistance were investigated using regression models adjusted for established risk factors. The best predictive panel of proteins on top of a non-invasive risk factor model or on top of HbA1c, age, and sex was selected. Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase (MASP) levels were positively associated with both incident type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. Adiponectin was inversely associated with incident type 2 diabetes. MASP, adiponectin, apolipoprotein A-IV, apolipoprotein C-II, C-reactive protein, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase D1 were associated with individual continuous outcomes. The combination of MASP, apolipoprotein E (apoE) and adiponectin improved diabetes prediction on top of both reference models, while prediabetes prediction was improved by MASP plus CRP on top of the HbA1c model. In conclusion, our mass spectrometric approach revealed a novel association of MASP with incident type 2 diabetes and incident prediabetes.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying vascular dysfunctions in diabetes include reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide, increased ROS and prothrombotic factors production, as well as activation of receptors for advanced glycation end-products. These alterations contribute to create a pro-inflammatory/thrombotic state that ultimately leads to plaque formation and complication. This study aimed at identifying differentially expressed plasma proteins between T2DM and non-diabetic patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, by means of two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with LC-MS/MS. Before analysis, plasma samples were enriched in low-expression proteins through Combinatorial hexapeptide ligand libraries. Both mono- and two-dimensional western blotting were performed for data validation. Differentially expressed proteins were mapped onto STRING v10 to build a protein protein interaction network. Sixteen differentially expressed spots were identified with a high score. Among them, there were fibrinogen beta and gamma chains, complement C1r, C3 and C4-B subcomponents, alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), vitronectin and CD5 antigen-like. Protein Protein interaction analysis evidenced a network among differentially expressed proteins in which vitronectin seems to represent a potentially pivotal node among fibrinolysis, complement dependent immune responses and inflammation in accordance with a number of in vitro and in vivo evidences for a contributory role of these proteins to the development of diabetic atherosclerosis.

Here we address, for the first time, the identification and validation of reference proteins for data standardization, which are essential for accurate comparison of protein levels in expression studies based on fat from obese and non-obese individuals. Methodology and Findings: To uncover adipose tissue proteins equally expressed either in omental and subcutaneous fat depots (study 1) or in omental fat from non-obese and obese individuals (study 2), we have reanalyzed our previously published data based on two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis. Twenty-four proteins (12 in study 1 and 12 in study 2) with similar expression levels in all conditions tested were selected and identified by mass spectrometry. Immunoblotting analysis was used to confirm in adipose tissue the expression pattern of the potential reference proteins and three proteins were validated: PARK7, ENOA and FAA. Western Blot analysis was also used to test customary loading control proteins. ENOA, PARK7 and the customary loading control protein Beta-actin showed steady expression profiles in fat from non-obese and obese individuals, whilst FAA maintained steady expression levels across paired omental and subcutaneous fat samples. Conclusions: ENOA, PARK7 and Beta-actin are proper reference standards in obesity studies based on omental fat, whilst FAA is the best loading control for the comparative analysis of omental and subcutaneous adipose tissues either in obese and non-obese subjects. Neither customary loading control proteins GAPDH and TBB5 nor CALX are adequate standards in differential expression studies on adipose tissue.

Currently, the pathogenesis of T2DM-related sarcopenia remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for T2DM-related sarcopenia. In this study, a T2DM-related sarcopenia mouse model was established using db/db mice. Proteins extracted from the gastrocnemius muscles of db/db mice and littermate control db/m mice were analyzed by a 4D label-free quantitative proteomics approach. A total of 131 upregulated and 68 downregulated proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that DEPs were significantly enriched in lipid metabolism. Protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed that six hub proteins, including ACOX1, CPT2, ECI2, ACADVL, ACADL, and ECH1, were involved in the fatty acid oxidation. The hub protein-transcription factor-miRNA network was also constructed using the NetworkAnalyst tool. Finally, the hub proteins were validated by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry and further confirmed to be significantly negatively correlated with muscle mass and grip strength. Our study suggested that lipid metabolism, especially excessive fatty acid oxidation, may be a crucial contributor to the progression of T2DM-related sarcopenia and a common cause of the inter-relationship between T2DM and sarcopenia.

Methods Firstly, we collected urine samples from type 2 diabetic patients and normal controls. These type 2 diabetic patients were divided into two groups according to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c% (HbA1c), respectively. Magnetic beads based weak cation exchange chromatography (MB-WCX) was used to condense urinary peptides. The eluates were then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Subsequently, ClinProt was used to profile and screen the polypeptide patterns based on different methods of grouping in diabetic patients and normal controls. Finally, the amino acid sequences of differentially expressed peptides were identified by nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and the protein sources of the corresponding peptide were matched in IPI Human database. Results Proteomics analysis found two up-regulated peptide (m/z 2756.1 and m/z 3223.2) representations in diabetic subjects, and the two peptides increased with increases in the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin. Further, the parallelism between m/z 3223.2 and glycosylated hemoglobin was better than the parallelism between m/z 2756.1 and glycosylated hemoglobin. Area under the receiver operating characteristic of the two peptides was 0.722 and 0.661, respectively. The above-mentioned peptide m/z 2756.1 was further identified as fragment of fibrinogen alpha chain precursor and m/z 3223.2 was fragment of prothrombin precusor.

We sought to determine changes in protein expressions in arterial tissue from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moreover hypothesized that metformin intake influences the protein composition. Methods and Results We analyzed nonatherosclerotic repair arteries gathered at coronary bypass operations from 30 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and from 30 age- and sex-matched nondiabetic individuals. Quantitative proteome analysis was performed by isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation-labeling and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, tandem mass spectrometry analysis on individual arterial samples. The amounts of the basement membrane components, 1-type IV collagen and 2-type IV collagen, 1-laminin and 2-laminin, were significantly increased in patients with diabetes mellitus. Moreover, the expressions of basement membrane components and other vascular proteins were significantly lower among metformin users when compared with nonusers. Patients treated with or without metformin had similar levels of hemoglobin A1c, cholesterol, and blood pressure. In addition, quantitative histomorphometry showed increased area fractions of collagen-stainable material in tunica intima and media among patients with diabetes mellitus. Conclusions The distinct accumulation of arterial basement membrane proteins in type 2 diabetes mellitus discloses a similarity between the diabetic macroangiopathy and microangiopathy and suggests a molecular explanation behind the alterations in vascular remodeling, biomechanical properties, and aneurysm formation described in diabetes mellitus.

Liver is a key organ for the maintenance of systemic glucose homeostasis in mammals, including humans and mice. Under many nutritional conditions the liver maintains nearly constant blood glucose. We analyzed the protein profile from the liver from ten-week old diabetic obese db/db mice through two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) and the identity of differentially expressed proteins was determined by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Some of these proteins were pyruvate carboxylase, carbamoyl-phosphate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, ornithine aminotransferase, selenium-binding protein, proteasome subunit alpha type-2, regucalcin, creatine kinase M-type, and others, which are involved in metabolic process of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Results suggest that alteration in the expression of these proteins plays a role in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes. In addition, we identified some proteins that have not been previously associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus.;;"Universidad de Guanajuato; Universidad de Guadalajara; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico";;;;;;;;;;5;6;;;;;;;;;;;;2016;13;3;;;;;231;236;;10.2174/1570164613666160722102430;http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1570164613666160722102430;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000389456200008;View Full Record in Web of Science

According to the International Diabetic Federation (IDF), 537 million people are currently living with diabetes and this number is projected to increase up to 783 million by 2045 (IDF Report 10th edition 2021). Individuals with type 2 diabetes remain asymptomatic for years or have already lost 50% to 70% of their pancreatic beta cells at the time of diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to discover more sensitive potential protein biomarker candidates capable of predicting progression to hyperglycemia before its onset (at pre-diabetes stage). To accomplish this, nano-liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (nano-LCMS) technique was applied to explore proteome of serum sample from people with normal glucose level (HbA1c <= 5.7%), pre-diabetes (HbA1c > 5.7% to < 6.5%), and type 2 diabetes (HbA1c >= 6.5%). Differential protein expression of 57 proteins were found between the study groups. Among these 12 proteins were found to be significantly differentially expressed. Proteins SERPINC1, APOA4, AHSG, ITIH4, A2M, VTN, HBB, JCHAIN, and IGHM were found common and with significantly higher expression in both pre-diabetes and diabetes groups as compared to the control. While proteins APOA2, CFB, and APCS were found exclusively significantly high in pre-diabetes group as compared to the diabetes group. The GO analysis resulted that these proteins are known to be performing the functions of modulator proteins, transfer/ carrier proteins, and most importantly are involved in inflammatory processes along with regulation of hydrolases and endopeptidases. The identified proteins hold potential for being early screening/diagnostic biomarker candidates of type 2 diabetes after further validation.;;"University of Karachi; King Abdulaziz University";;;;;;;;;;5;5;;;;;;;;;;;JUN 2;2022;28;4;;;;;;;111;10.1007/s10989-022-10419-9;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10989-022-10419-9;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000805166600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This is important as proteins are the functional components that regulate an organ's activity. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were induced to diabetes using streptozotocin (STZ) and nicotinamide (NA). The diabetic rats and control rats were respectively fed with either a normal diet (ND) or a high-fat diet (HFD) that contained 39% fat for 6 consecutive weeks. The pancreases were harvested from the rats for proteomic analysis upon completion of the treatment period. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis was applied for protein separation and the significantly (p<0.05) upregulated protein spots in pair-wise comparison between different groups of rats were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis for protein identification. The results showed that upregulation of anionic trypsin 1 and 2 in diabetic rats fed with ND compared to control rats fed with the same diet. The upregulation of these two proteins in diabetic rats acts as the defense mechanism against pancreatic tissue inflammation upon HFD intake. Moreover, upregulation of chymotrypsinogen B and transgelin-3 were detected in diabetic rats fed with HFD compared to those fed with ND, suggesting that these proteins may be induced by HFD intake, where upregulation of chymotrypsinogen B is a sign of pancreatic inflammation. Thus, HFD may influence specific pancreatic processes based on the observed protein changes.;;"Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2024;53;6;;;;;;;;10.55230/mabjournal.v53i6.4;http://dx.doi.org/10.55230/mabjournal.v53i6.4;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001402896700005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Methodology The sample consisted of 18 patients with asymptomatic AP divided into two groups according to the presence of T2DM: diabetic group-patients with T2DM (n = 9) and control group-systemically healthy patients (n = 9). After sample collection, the root canal samples were prepared for proteomic analysis using reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis was performed by Protein Lynx Global Service software. Differences in protein expression between groups were calculated using t-test (p < .05). Biological functions were analysed using the Homo sapiens UniProt database. Results A total of 727 human proteins were identified in all samples. Among them, 124 proteins common to both groups were quantified, out of which 65 proteins from the diabetic group showed significant differences compared with the control: 43 upregulated (p < .05) and 22 downregulated (p < .05) proteins. No significant differences in protein expression were seen for the remaining 59 proteins (p > .05). Most proteins with differences in expression were related to immune/inflammatory response. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, Plastin-2, Lactotransferrin and 13 isoforms of immunoglobulins were upregulated. In contrast, Protein S100-A8, Protein S100-A9, Histone H2B, Neutrophil defensin 1, Neutrophil defensin 3 and Prolactin-inducible protein were downregulated.

Materials and MethodsWe carried out quantitative proteomic analysis using serum samples from 8- and 16-week-old LEA and control Brown Norway (BN) rats (n = 4/group). Differentially expressed proteins were validated by multiple reaction monitoring analysis using the sera collected from 8-, 16-, and 24-week-old LEA (n = 4/each group) and BN rats (n = 5/each group). Among the validated proteins, we also examined the possible relevance of the human homolog of serine protease inhibitor A3 (SERPINA3) to type 2 diabetes mellitus. ResultsThe use of 2-D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis analysis and the following liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring analysis showed that the serum levels of five proteins were differentially changed between LEA rats and BN rats at all three time-points examined. Among the five proteins, SERPINA3N was increased significantly in the sera of LEA rats compared with age-matched BN rats. The serum level of SERPINA3 was also found to be significantly higher in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients than in healthy control participants. Furthermore, glycated hemoglobin, fasting insulin and estimated glomerular filtration rate were independently associated with the SERPINA3 levels.

One side effect of this drug, hepatotoxicity, is well recognized; however, the precise mechanisms underlying tolbutamide-induced hepatotoxicity remain unclear. In this respect, proteomics techniques were used to gain further insight into the mechanistic processes of the hepatotoxicity induced by this drug. In this study, we aimed to identify molecular pathways based on proteins responding to cellular toxicity in tolbutamide-treated primary hepatocytes, using nano UPLC-MS/MS analysis. Rat primary hepatocytes were treated with an IC20 concentration for 24 h to study the hepatotoxic effects of tolbutamide. For high-throughput label-free quantitation, tryptic-digested peptides of proteins from cell lysates were analyzed using LC-MS/MS and quantitated using the IDEAL-Q software, in which several parameters, such as assisted sequence, elution time, and mass-to-charge ratio were included. We quantified a total of 330 distinct proteins from the tolbutamide-treated hepatocytes and identified 55 upregulated and 82 downregulated proteins with expression changes. Among these differentially expressed proteins, we focused mainly on the 18 upregulated proteins belonging to xenobiotic cytochrome P450 (CYP), drug metabolism/detoxification, oxidative stress/antioxidant response, and cell damage pathway.

In addition, various xenobiotic CYP proteins upregulated in the tolbutamide-treated group, CYP2D1, CYP2C13, and CYP2C11 were confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis.

In the present study, we aimed to identify and biochemically characterize proteins associated with diabetes mellitus in a Qatari population. Methods: In a diabetes case-control study (175 cases, 164 controls; Arab, South Asian and Philippine ethnicities), we conducted a discovery study to screen 1141 blood protein levels for associations with diabetes mellitus. Additional analyses were done in controls in relation to Hb1Ac, and biochemical characterization of the main findings was performed with metabolomics (501 metabolites). We performed two-sample Mendelian Randomization to provide evidence of potential causality using data from European descent of the DIAGRAM consortium (74,124 cases of diabetes mellitus and 824,006 controls) for the identified proteins for T2D and Hb1Ac. Results: After accounting for multiple testing, 30 protein levels were different (p-values < 8.6e(-5)) between cases and controls. Of these, a higher Hb1Ac in controls was associated with a lower IGFBP-2 level (p-value=4.1e(-6)). IGFBP-2 protein level was found lower among cases compared with controls across all ethnicities. In controls, IGFBP-2 was associated with 21 metabolite levels, but specifically connected to the metabolite citrulline in network analyses. We observed no evidence, however, that the association between IGFBP-2 and diabetes mellitus was causal.

To evaluate the effect of glycemic levels in middle-aged and elderly individuals with T2DM on salivary proteomics, we compared the differences by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Unstimulated whole saliva samples from 8 T2DM patients with good glycemic control (G group, HbA1c <6.5%) and 16 patients with poor control (P group, HbA1c >= 6.5%) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS in the data-independent acquisition mode (Clinical register number: ChiCTR1900023582.). After functional annotation, cluster analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were carried out to screen and evaluate candidate proteins. A total of 5,721 proteins were quantified, while 40 proteins differed significantly. In the P group, proteins involved in oxidative stress-related processes were upregulated, whereas proteins related to salivary secretion were downregulated. The combination of thioredoxin domain-containing protein 17, zymogen granule protein 16B, and FAM3 metabolism regulating signaling molecule D yielded an area under the curve of 0.917 which showed a robust ability to distinguish the P and G groups. In conclusion, poorly controlled hyperglycemia may affect salivary proteins through various pathways, including oxidative stress and glandular secretion. Furthermore, the differentially expressed proteins, especially the three proteins with the best differentiation, might serve as an anchor point for the further study of hyperglycemia and oral diseases.;;"Peking University; Peking University";;;;;;;;;;8;9;;;;;;;;;;;DEC 10;2021;8;;;;;;;;790091;10.3389/fmolb.2021.790091;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2021.790091;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000743568300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, native GLP-1 pharmacokinetics reveals low bioavailability due to degradation by the ubiquitous dipeptydil peptidase IV (DPP-IV) endoprotease. In this study, the glucosamine-based polymer chitosan was used as a cationic polymer-based in vitro delivery system for GLP-1, DPP-IV resistant GLP-1 analogues and siRNA targeting DPP-IV mRNA. We found chitosans to form spherical nanocomplexes with these nucleic acids, generating two distinct non-overlapping size ranges of 141-283 nm and 68-129 nm for plasmid and siRNA, respectively. The low molecular weight high DDA chitosan 92-10-5 (degree of deacetylation, molecular weight and N:P ratio (DDA-Mn-N:P)) showed the highest plasmid DNA transfection efficiency in HepG2 and Caco-2 cell lines when compared to 80-10-10 and 80-80-5 chitosans. Recombinant native GLP-1 protein levels in media of transfected cells reached 23 ng/L while our DPP-IV resistant analogues resulted in a fivefold increase of GLP-1 protein levels (115 ng/L) relative to native GLP-1, and equivalent to the Lipofectamine positive control. We also found that all chitosan-DPP-IV siRNA nanocomplexes were capable of DPP-IV silencing, with 92-10-5 being significantly more effective in abrogating enzymatic activity of DPP-IV in media of silenced cells, and with no apparent cytotoxicity. These results indicate that specific chitosan formulations may be effectively used for the delivery of plasmid DNA and siRNA in a combination therapy of type 2 diabetes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Since hyperglycemia is able to change the protein components contained in plasma exosomes, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is considered as feasible to analyze the expression of plasma exosomal proteins in patients with T2DM and non-diabetic patients respec-tively, find critical biological markers, and explore the mechanism of DK as well as potential therapeutic targets. Method: Blood and clinical information of corneal epithelial injury in a diabetic group (the study group) and a non-diabetic group (the control group), who were patients admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology, Yangpu Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine from July 2020 to November 2020, were collected. The qEV size exclusion method was adopted to separate exosomes from plasma. The exosomes were then identified through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analyzer (NTA), and Western blot. The plasma exosomes of the study group and the control group were quantitatively analyzed by proteomics. A bioinformatics method is utilized to screen differential proteins and the expression of the differential proteins was verified by Western blot. Result: TEM indicated that the exosomes had a double-concave disc-like appearance, with a size of about 100 nm, and Western blot expressed as CD63 and TSG101. The plasma exosomes of the study group and the control group were analyzed by quantitative proteomics with a total number of 952 proteins detected of which 245 proteins existed in the ExoCarta exosomal protein database. Through adoption of P-value to screen credible differential proteins, the heat map displayed 28 differential proteins, 7 upregulated proteins, and 21 downregulated proteins; the volcano map displayed 7 upregulated proteins and 22 downregulated proteins; the PPI interaction map displayed 12 upregulated proteins and 18 downregulated proteins. Through GO enrichment analysis, it was identified that the differential protein participated in the main biological processes and was involved in regu-lating the cell's stimulation response to insulin, the insulin receptor signaling pathway, and the activity of glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase D as well as anti-oxidation. The enriched cell components include main components such as exosomes, blood particles, and cytoplasm. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the target protein FLOT2 was mainly concentrated in insulin-related signaling pathways. Western blot indicated that the expression of FLOT2 in the study group was lower compared with the control group while the expression of Exo70 was higher. Conclusion: Proteomic analysis of the study group and the control group displayed a variety of proteins in plasma exosomes. The downregulated protein FLOT2 in the study group was closely related to the occurrence, devel-opment, and complication of DK in T2DM patients.

The secretion of insulin secretory granule content in response to an acute increase of glucose concentration is a highly regulated process allowing normal glycemic homeostasis. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by chronic hyperglycemia. The consequent prolonged glucose exposure is known to exert deleterious effects on the function of various organs, notably impairment of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells and induction of apoptosis. It has also been described as modifying gene and protein expression in beta-cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that a modulation of insulin secretory granule protein expression induced by chronic hyperglycemia may partially explain beta-cell dysfunction. To identify the potential early molecular mechanisms underlying beta-cell dysfunction during chronic hyperglycemia, we performed SILAC and mass spectrometry experiments to monitor changes in the insulin secretory granule proteome from INS-1E rat insulinoma beta-cells cultivated either with 11 or 30 mM of glucose for 24 h. Fourteen proteins were found to be differentially expressed between these two conditions, and several of these proteins were not described before to be present in beta-cells. Among them, neuronal pentraxin 1 was only described in neurons so far. Here we investigated its expression and intracellular localization in INS-1E cells. Furthermore, its overexpression in glucotoxic conditions was confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels. According to its role in hypoxia-ischemia-induced apoptosis described in neurons, this suggests that neuronal pentraxin 1 might be a new beta-cell mediator in the AKT/GSK3 apoptotic pathway. In conclusion, the modification of specific beta-cell pathways such as apoptosis and oxidative stress may partially explain the impairment of insulin secretion and beta-cell failure, observed after prolonged exposure to high glucose concentrations.

This study aimed to identify specific biomarkers that can detect lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) in T2DM patients for the early diagnosis of LAC. Methods The clinical information of hospitalized T2DM patients diagnosed with various cancers was collected by reviewing medical records in Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University from January 1, 2015, to June 30, 2020. To discover diagnostic biomarkers for early-stage LAC in the T2DM population, 20 samples obtained from 5 healthy controls, 5 T2DM patients, 5 LAC patients and 5 T2DM patients with LAC (T2DM + LAC) were subjected to sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectrum (SWATH-MS) analysis to identify specific differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs) for LAC in patients with T2DM. Then, these results were validated by parallel reaction monitoring MS (PRM-MS) and ELISA analyses. Results Lung cancer was the most common malignant tumor in patients with T2DM, and LAC accounted for the majority of cases. Using SWATH-MS analysis, we found 13 proteins to be unique in T2DM patients with early LAC. Two serum proteins were further validated by PRM-MS analysis, namely, pregnancy-zone protein (PZP) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). Furthermore, the diagnostic values of these proteins were validated by ELISA, and PZP was validated as a novel serum biomarker for screening LAC in T2DM patients. Conclusions Our findings indicated that PZP could be used as a novel serum biomarker for the identification of LAC in T2DM patients, which will enhance auxiliary diagnosis and assist in the selection of surgical treatment at an early stage.;;"Jiangnan University; Nanjing Medical University; Jiangnan University; Nanjing Medical University; Jiangnan University; Nanjing Medical University; Nanjing Medical University; Jiangnan University; Jiangnan University; Nanjing Medical University";;;;;;;;;;9;9;;;;;;;;;;;MAR 10;2021;21;1;;;;;;;162;10.1186/s12935-021-01861-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12935-021-01861-8;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000627854300003;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the link between insulin resistance and beta-cell failure in T2D is not fully understood. To explore this association, we studied transgenic MKR mice that initially develop insulin resistance in skeletal muscle but by 8 weeks of age have T2D. In the present study, global islet protein and gene expression changes were characterized in diabetic MKR versus non-diabetic control mice at 10 weeks of age. Using a quantitative proteomics approach (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)), 159 proteins were differentially expressed in MKR compared with control islets. Marked up-regulation of protein biosynthesis and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways and parallel down-regulation in insulin processing/ secretion, energy utilization, and metabolism were observed. A fraction of the differentially expressed proteins identified (including GLUT2, DNAJC3, VAMP2, RAB3A, and PC1/3) were linked previously to insulin-secretory defects and T2D. However, many proteins for the first time were associated with islet dysfunction, including the unfolded protein response proteins (ERP72, ERP44, ERP29, PPIB, FKBP2, FKBP11, and DNAJB11), endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation proteins (VCP and UFM1), and multiple proteins associated with mitochondrial energy metabolism (NDUFA9, UQCRH, COX2, COX4l1, COX5A, ATP6V1B2, ATP6V1H, ANT1, ANT2, ETFA, and ETFB). The mRNA expression level corresponding to these proteins was examined by microarray, and then a small subset was validated using quantitative real time PCR and Western blot analyses. Importantly similar to 54% of differentially expressed proteins in MKR islets (including proteins involved in proinsulin processing, protein biosynthesis, and mitochondrial oxidation) showed changes in the proteome but not transcriptome, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation. These results underscore the importance of integrated mRNA and protein expression measurements and validate the use of the iTRAQ method combined with microarray to assess global protein and gene changes involved in the development T2D.;;"University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto";;;;;;;;;;166;193;;;;;;;;;;;AUG;2008;7;8;;;;;1434;1451;;10.1074/mcp.M700478-MCP200;http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/mcp.M700478-MCP200;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000258283400003;View Full Record in Web of Science

This biopsy-based study aimed to identify nephropathological risk factors for ESRD in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. Histological features of 322 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients with biopsy-confirmed diabetic nephropathy (DN) were retrospectively analysed. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for ESRD. Single glomerular proteomics and immunohistochemistry were used to identify differentially expressed proteins and enriched pathways in glomeruli. During the median follow-up period of 24 months, 144 (45%) patients progressed to ESRD. In multivariable models, the Renal Pathology Society classification failed to predict ESRD, although the solidified glomerulosclerosis (score 1: HR 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-2.60; score 2: HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.40-4.37) and extracapillary hypercellularity (HR 2.68, 95% CI 1.55-4.62) were identified as independent risk factors. Additionally, single glomerular proteomics, combined with immunohistochemistry, revealed that complement C9 and apolipoprotein E were highly expressed in solidified glomerulosclerosis. Therefore, solidified glomerulosclerosis and extracapillary hypercellularity predict diabetic ESRD in Chinese patients. Single glomerular proteomics identified solidified glomerulosclerosis as a unique pathological change that may be associated with complement overactivation and abnormal lipid metabolism.";;"Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Baylor University Medical Center; Baylor University; Monash University";;;;;;;;;;19;21;;;;;;;;;;;FEB 25;2021;11;1;;;;;;;4658;10.1038/s41598-021-83856-z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83856-z;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000626621800018;View Full Record in Web of Science

First published December 28, 2011; doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00424.2011.-We sought to identify novel urinary biomarkers of kidney function in type 2 diabetes. We screened the renal transcriptome of db/db and db/m mice for differentially expressed mRNA transcripts that encode secreted proteins with human orthologs. Whether elevated urine levels of the orthologous proteins correlated with diminished glomerular filtration rate was tested in a cross-sectional study of n = 56 patients with type 2 diabetes. We identified 36 putative biomarker genes in db/db kidneys: 31 upregulated and 5 downregulated. Urinary protein levels of six selected candidates (endothelin-1, lipocalin-2, transforming growth factor-beta, growth and differentiation factor-15, interleukin-6, and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1) were elevated in type 2 diabetic patients with subnormal glomerular filtration rate (i.e., <90 ml.min(-1).1.73 m(-2)), independent of microalbuminuria, age, sex, race, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists. In contrast, urinary levels of fibroblast growth factor were not increased. A composite variable of urine albumin and any of the six candidate markers was associated with subnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate more closely than albumin alone. In addition, urinary endothelin-1, growth and differentiation factor-15, and interleukin-6 were associated with a marker of proximal tubule damage, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity. These results suggest that gene expression profiling in diabetic mouse kidney can complement existing proteomic-based approaches for renal biomarker discovery in humans.";;"University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University";;;;;;;;;;26;27;;;;;;;;;;;APR;2012;302;7;;;;;F820;F829;;10.1152/ajprenal.00424.2011;http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajprenal.00424.2011;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000302339500004;View Full Record in Web of Science

Finally, differentially expressed proteins are validated by ELISA. Results A total of 1922 proteins are identified, of which 1814 contain quantitative information. Ultimately, 650 of these proteins yield quantitative values. WGCNA performed on these 650 proteins reveal four distinct hub genes of diabetic DE.

Finding specific biomarkers to assist in diagnosing and treating patients with obese and T2DM is critical. Materials and Methods: We collected liver tissues from obesity patients with and without T2DM for proteomic sequencing and immunohistochemistry assay. Analysis Gene Ontology(GO) enrichment, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG), and protein interaction network (PPI) were performed on the parameters and data derived from the Tandem Mass Tags(TMT)-based proteomics analysis of liver tissues. Transcriptome data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO)website and genes that are deferentially expressed in both transcriptome and proteome were selected. Results: We identified 140 deferentially expressed proteins from proteomic sequencing. Six biomarkers were deferentially expressed in both proteome and transcriptome with consistent changes in direction. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis suggested CMPK1, the expression with greatest difference, was the core protein among the six biomarkers. Immunohistochemistry validated CMPK1 was upregulated significantly in the liver tissues of T2DM patients. The correlation analysis revealed that the expression of CMPK1 was significantly associated with key molecules in T2DM-related pathways at both protein and transcriptome levels. Conclusion and Novelty: Our study showed CMPK1 was upregulated in the liver of T2DM patients and provides a possible new target for screening and diagnosing T2DM in patients with obese and a novel theoretical basis for the pathophysiological mechanism of obesity-related metabolic diseases.;;"Southwest Jiaotong University; Central South University; Southwest Jiaotong University; Southwest Jiaotong University; Southwest Jiaotong University; Southwest Jiaotong University";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;;2024;17;;;;;;2923;2934;;10.2147/DMSO.S467950;http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DMSO.S467950;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001282038900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In the current study, we aimed to assess the role of thymosin beta-4 (Tb-4) on endothelial function using dia-hiPSC-ECs as disease model of endothelial dysfunction. Methods and results Using dia-hiPSC-ECs as models of endothelial dysfunction, we determined the effect of Tb-4 on cell proliferation, senescence, cyto-protection, protein expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), secretion of endothelin-1 and MMP-1, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cyto-protection in vitro and angiogenic potential for treatment of ischemic limb disease in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in vivo. We found that 600 ng/mL Tb4 significantly up-regulated AKT activity and Bcl-XL protein expression, enhanced dia-hiPSC-EC viability and proliferation, limited senescence, reduced endothelin-1 and MMP-1 secretion, and improved reparative potency of dia-hiPSC-ECs for treatment of ischemic limb disease in mice with T2DM. However, Tb4 had no effect on improving mitochondrial membrane potential and glycine homeostasis and reducing intercellular adhesion molecule-1 protein expression in dia-hiPSC-ECs.

This study aims to determine the effects of FGR and early catch-up growth after birth on the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, with particular attention to glucose tolerance, pancreatic islet morphology, and fibrosis, and to elucidate its mechanism using proteomics analysis. The FGR rat model was made by inducing mild intrauterine hypoperfusion using ameroid constrictors (ACs). On day 17 of pregnancy, ACs were affixed to the uterine and ovarian arteries bilaterally, causing a 20.9% reduction in birth weight compared to sham pups. On postnatal day 4 (P4), the pups were assigned to either the good nutrition (GN) groups with 5 pups per dam to ensure postnatal catch-up growth or poor nutrition groups with 15 pups per dam to maintain lower body weight. After weaning, all pups were fed regular chow food ad libitum (P21). Rats in both FGR groups developed glucose intolerance; however, male rats in the FGR good nutrition (FGR-GN) group also developed hypertriglyceridemia and dysmorphic pancreatic islets with fibrosis. A comprehensive and functional analysis of proteins expressed in the pancreas showed that FGR, followed by early catch-up growth, severely aggravated cell adhesion-related protein expression in male offspring. Thus, FGR and early catch-up growth caused pancreatic islet morphological abnormalities and fibrosis associated with the disturbance of cell adhesion-related protein expressions. These changes likely induce glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia in male rats.";;"Nagoya University; Nagoya University; Sanyo-Onoda City University; Kyoto Womens University";;;;;;;;;;2;2;;;;;;;;;;;FEB 15;2023;13;1;;;;;;;2732;10.1038/s41598-023-28584-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-28584-2;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001012758100019;View Full Record in Web of Science

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of EC. Currently, no proteomic studies have investigated the role of diabetes in endometrial cancers from clinical samples. The present study aims to elucidate the molecular link between diabetes and EC using a proteomic approach. Endometrial tissue samples were obtained from age-matched patients (EC Diabetic and EC Non-Diabetic) during surgery. Untargeted proteomic analysis of the endometrial tissues was carried out using a two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF). A total of 53 proteins were identified, with a significant difference in abundance (analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, p <= 0.05; fold-change >= 1.5) between the two groups, among which 30 were upregulated and 23 downregulated in the EC Diabetic group compared to EC Non-Diabetic. The significantly upregulated proteins included peroxiredoxin-1, vinculin, endoplasmin, annexin A5, calreticulin, and serotransferrin. The significantly downregulated proteins were myosin regulatory light polypeptide 9, Retinol dehydrogenase 12, protein WWC3, intraflagellar transport protein 88 homolog, superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn], and retinal dehydrogenase 1. The network pathway was related to connective tissue disorder, developmental disorder, and hereditary disorder, with the identified proteins centered around dysregulation of ERK1/2 and F Actin signaling pathways. Cancer-associated protein alterations such as upregulation of peroxiredoxin-1, annexin 5, and iNOS, and downregulation of RDH12, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1, SOD1, and MYL 9, were found in the EC tissues of the diabetic group.

So far, the pathogenesis of diabetes has not been fully elucidated. Identifying new potential molecule mechanisms and biomarkers in this process could contribute to the understanding of pathophysiology. Experimental design Proteomic changes in the liver of type 2 diabetic mice (n = 6) and normal mice (n = 6) are studied. Triplicate experiments are carried out for each sample. Results A total of 15 differentially expressed proteins (DEPS) are identified and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis indicates that DEPS mainly involved two inflammatory pathways: glutathione metabolic pathway and the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway. The core of protein-protein interaction is the tumor necrosis factor inflammatory pathway, indicating the connection between inflammation and diabetes. Ten out of fifteen gene transcript levels are consistent with proteomics by quantitative RT-PCR validation. The transcriptional levels of OAT (ornithine aminotransferase) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase1 (FBP1) were significantly increased, whereas fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) and ef-2 transcription levels decreased significantly. In addition, western blotting results showed that the expression of OAT and FBP protein increased significantly in the diabetes group, while elongation factor 2 decreased significantly and FABP do not have significant difference in the diabetes group.

Aims To better understand the association between T2DM and NAFLD, global changes in protein expression in diabetic and non-diabetic obese subjects were assessed by a proteomic approach. Methods Liver samples were obtained from diabetic and non-diabetic morbid obese subjects (BMI>40kg/m2). Histological analysis was used to evaluate hepatic steatosis and the degree of anatomopathological alteration. Changes in protein expression were analysed by two-dimentional electrophoresis combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Levels of glutathione, carbonyl and 4-HNE protein adducts were used to assess oxidative stress status. Results Of 850 proteins analysed, 33 were differentially expressed in T2DM obese subjects. Of these, 27 were unequivocally identified by mass spectrometry. Analysis of protein sets revealed patterns of decreased abundance in mitochondrial enzymes, proteins involved in methione metabolism, and oxidative stress response. Accordingly, T2DM subjects showed decreased levels of glutathione, the antioxidant byproduct of methionine metabolism via the transsulfuration pathway, and higher levels of protein and lipid oxidative damage. Changes in detoxyfing enzymes, carbohydrate metabolism, proteasome subunits and retinoic acid synthesis were also found. Conclusions The results suggest alterations in mitochondrial function and methionine metabolism as potential contributing factors to increased oxidative stress in liver of obese diabetic patients which may be influencing the development of NAFLD and NASH.;;"Universitat de les Illes Balears; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBEROBN; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; University of Navarra; University of Navarra; University of Navarra";;;;;;;;;;23;28;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2012;32;6;;;;;951;961;;10.1111/j.1478-3231.2012.02765.x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1478-3231.2012.02765.x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000304867800012;View Full Record in Web of Science

In the development of type II diabetes, a progressive impairment of insulin secretion by the pancreatic P-cells occurs called beta-cell dysfunction or beta-cell failure. Chronic hyperglycemia has been shown being involved in beta-cell dysfunction, a phenomenon known as glucotoxicity. The molecular mechanisms underlying the impairment of insulin secretion by P-cells induced by glucotoxicity are still not fully understood. In this work, quantitative proteomics was employed to identify early key players involved in beta-cell dysfunction induced by glucotoxicity. For this, the stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture strategy was used on the slowly-growing rat beta-cell line INS-1E. We showed that the stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture approach did not induce any detectable biological effects on these beta-cells, as measured at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. Proteins differentially expressed between control cells and cells submitted to chronic high glucose concentrations were identified and verified. The results obtained reinforce the link between glucotoxicity and lipogenesis and suggest that the fatty acid metabolism pathway may rapidly be stimulated in beta-cells submitted to chronic high glucose concentrations.;;"University of Geneva; University of Geneva; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics; University of Geneva";;;;;;;;;;11;11;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2010;10;1;;;;;59;71;;10.1002/pmic.200900080;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pmic.200900080;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000274007700006;View Full Record in Web of Science

It is well known that metformin acts via complex mechanisms, including multitarget and multipathway mechanisms; however, the multi-targeted antidiabetic genes of metformin remain obscure. The present study aimed to perform transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of potential therapeutic target genes in the liver of metformin-treated Sprague-Dawley rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The type 2 diabetes rat model was established using streptozotocin. Fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, serum insulin and biological parameters were subsequently measured. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and proteins were identified in the rat livers by expression profile analysis and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). A 1.5-fold alteration in gene expression, as determined using chip-based expression profile analysis, and a 1.2-fold alteration in protein expression, as determined using iTRAQ, were considered physiologically significant benchmarks, which were used to identify DEGS in metformin-treated rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The DEGs were verified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis. Numerous hepatic genes involved in various metabolic pathways were affected by metformin; in particular, genes associated with lipid metabolism were markedly affected. Expression profile analysis and iTRAQ analysis suggested that carboxylesterase 1C subunit (Ces1C) and cholesterol 7-hydroxylyase (Cyp7a1) may serve as important DEGs, which were validated by qPCR and western blot analysis. Ces1C and Cyp7a1 are the main enzymes in cholesterol metabolism, yet the result of western blotting was not consistent with qPCR. The present study demonstrated that metformin may affect the expression of numerous hepatic genes involved in metabolic pathways, particularly the lipid and cholesterol metabolic pathways. Ces1C and Cyp7a1 may be considered novel therapeutic target genes in the liver, which are involved in the antidiabetic effects of metformin.";;"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University; Zhejiang Chinese Medical University";;;;;;;;;;17;18;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2018;41;6;;;;;3327;3341;;10.3892/ijmm.2018.3535;http://dx.doi.org/10.3892/ijmm.2018.3535;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000430556300023;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, scarce information is currently available on the association between distinct plasma ceramides (that have been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality) and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a group of individuals at high risk of developing CVD and other chronic inflammation-related conditions. Methods. - We measured six previously identified high-risk plasma ceramide species [Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer(d18:1/20:0), Cer(d18:1/22:0), Cer(d18:1/24:0), Cer(d18:1/24:1)] in 92 postmenopausal women with T2DM attending the diabetes outpatient service over a 3-month period. Plasma ceramide levels were measured using targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay. Results. - Plasma hs-CRP levels were positively associated with all measured ceramides in univariable linear regression analyses. However, only plasma Cer(d18:1/16:0) (standard beta coefficient: 0.27, P = 0.015), Cer(d18:1/22:0) (standard beta coefficient: 0.25, P = 0.032) and Cer(d18:1/24:1) (standard beta coefficient: 0.30, P= 0.007) remained significantly associated with increased plasma hs-CRP levels after adjusting for age, adiposity measures, diabetes duration, HbA(1c), insulin resistance, smoking, hypertension, plasma LDL cholesterol, estimated glomerular filtration rate, preexisting ischaemic heart disease and use of lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, antiplatelet or hypoglycaemic drugs. Conclusion. - In postmenopausal women with T2DM, elevated levels of specific plasma ceramides are associated with higher plasma hs-CRP levels independent of established cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes-related variables and other potential confounding factors.

Serum from persons with NGT and persons with T2DM was profiled using ProteinChip arrays and time-of-flight mass spectra were generated by surface enhanced laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS). Results: Mass spectra from NGT- and T2DM-groups were compared. Fifteen proteins ranging from 5 to 79 kDa were differentially expressed (p < 0.05). Five of these proteins showed decreased and ten showed increased serum levels in individuals with T2DM. To be able to identify the proteins, the complexity of the sample was reduced by fractionation approaches. Subsequently, the purified fractions containing biomarkers were separated by one- dimensional SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in two identical lanes. Protein bands of the first lane were excised and subjected to passive elution to recapture the biomarkers on ProteinChip arrays. The corresponding bands of the second lane were subjected to peptide-mass fingerprinting (PMF). Using this approach four of the differentially expressed proteins were identified as apolipoprotein C3 (9.4 kDa), transthyretin (13.9 kDa), albumin (66 kDa) and transferrin (79 kDa). Whereas apolipoprotein C3 and transthyretin were up-regulated, albumin and transferrin were downregulated in T2DM. Conclusion: Protocols for protein profiling by SELDI- TOF MS and protein identification by fractionation, SDS- PAGE and PMF were optimized for serum from humans with T2DM. With these protocols differentially expressed proteins were discovered and identified when serum from NGT-and T2DM-individuals was analyzed.;;"Uppsala University; Karolinska Institutet";;;;;;;;;;50;56;;;;;;;;;;;DEC 12;2006;4;;;;;;;;22;10.1186/1477-5956-4-22;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1477-5956-4-22;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000246481800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

To study the mechanism(s) by which a HFD impairs glucose tolerance, we used a quantitative proteomic platform that integrated pI-based OFFGEL fractionation and iTRAQ labeling to profile the temporal changes in adipose membrane protein expression in mice fed a HFD for up to 8 months. Within 2 months of starting the diet, the mice adipose and liver tissues accumulated fat droplets, which contributed to subsequent insulin resistance and glucose intolerance within 6 months. The membrane proteomic delineation of such phenotypic expression resulted in quantification of 1713 proteins with 266, 343, and 125 differentially expressed proteins in 2-, 6-, and 8-month HFD-fed versus control mice, respectively. Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed proteins revealed the interplay between upregulation of fatty acid metabolism and downregulation of glucose metabolism. Substantial upregulation of adipose and liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase (Cpt) 1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria, occurred by 2 months. The increase in hepatic Cpt la expression was associated with a progressive decrease in glucose uptake as evidenced by downregulation of the liver glucose transporter protein (Glut) 2. Loss of glycogen storage was found in those hepatocytes full of fat droplets. Intriguingly, skeletal muscle Cpt 1b expression was unaltered by the HFD, whereas skeletal muscle Glut 4 and tyrosine phosphoryated insulin receptor substrate 1 (p-IRS1) were substantially upregulated at the same time as abnormal glucose metabolism developed in adipose and liver tissues. This study defines some of the molecular mechanisms as well as the relationship among adipose tissue, liver and skeletal muscle during development of HFD-induced glucose intolerance in vivo and identifies Cpt 1 as a potential drug target for the control or prevention of diabetes.;;"Taipei Medical University; Taipei Medical University; Taipei Municipal WanFang Hospital; Taipei Municipal WanFang Hospital; Taipei Medical University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Chung Hsing University; Taipei Municipal WanFang Hospital; Taipei Medical University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan";;;;;;;;;;14;15;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2013;12;3;;;;;1120;1133;;10.1021/pr300662j;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr300662j;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000315708000006;View Full Record in Web of Science

Discovery set: weak cationic-exchange magnetic beads coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used to profile the low-molecular weight peptidome in urine samples from type 2 diabetes patients with normoal-buminura and microalbuminuria. The differently expressed urinary peptides were screened by ClinProTools2.1 bioinformatics software and identified through nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Verification set: the above screened urinary peptides were validated by use matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on another group of type 2 diabetes patients with different extents use of kidney injury. In the screening and identification stages, seven urinary peptides were selected as the most promising biomarker candidates, and they were identified as fragments of vitronectin precursor, isoform 1 of fibrinogen alpha chain precursor, prothrombin precursor and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4. The diagnostic efficacy of these urinary peptides was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and they were 0.767, 0.768, 0.868, 0.910, 0.860, 0.843, and 0.865, respectively.

The decreased proteins were the prostatic acid phosphatase precursor, the ribonuclease and the kallikrein-3. Eight proteins were progressively increased in both patients groups: transthyretin precursor, Ig K chain C region, Ig K chain V-II region Cum, Ig K-chain VIII region SIE, carbonic anhydrase 1, plasma retinol-binding protein, beta-2-microglobulin precursor, beta-2-glycoprotein 1. The proteomic analysis allowed us to identify several increased urinary proteins, not only in T2DN but also in T2D patients in which the microalburninuria was in the normal range.

All these proteomic applications to pharmacological issues may be called pharmacoproteomics. The pharmacoproteomic approach could be particularly useful for the identification of molecular alterations implicated in type 2 diabetes and for further characterization of existing or new drugs. In oncology, proteomics is widely used for the identification of tumour-specific protein markers, and pharmacoproteomics is used for the evaluation of chemotherapy, particularly for the characterization of drug-resistance mechanisms. The large amount of data generated by pharmacoproteomic screening requires the use of bioinformatic tools to insure a pertinent interpretation.

We employed an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach to analyze the proteomic changes in the sera collected from a pair of 4-week-old KK-A(y) versus C57BL/6 mice. Among the 227 proteins identified, a total of 45 proteins were differentially expressed in KK-A(y) versus C57BL/6 mice. We comparatively analyzed a series of the sera collected at 4 and 12 weeks of age from KK-A(y) and C57BL/6 mice for the target protein using multiple reaction monitoring analysis, and identified 8 differentially expressed proteins between the sera of these mice at both time points. Among them, serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 3K (SERPINA3K) levels were elevated significantly in the sera of KK-A(y) mice compared to C57BL/6 mice. An in vitro assay revealed that the human homologue SERPINA3 increased the transendothelial permeability of retinal microvascular endothelial cells, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes and/or diabetic retinopathy. With the identified proteins, our proteomics study could provide valuable clues for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with T2DM. Biological significance In this paper, we investigated the serum proteome of KK-A(y) mice in a pre-diabetic state compared to that of wild type controls in an attempt to uncover early diagnostic markers of diabetes that are maintained through a diabetic phenotype. We used iTRAQ-based two-dimensional LC-MS/MS serum profiling, and identified several differentially expressed proteins at the pre-diabetic stage. The differential expression was confirmed by multiple reaction monitoring assay, which is fast gaining ground as a sensitive, specific, and cost-effective methodology for relative quantification of the candidate proteins. Using these techniques, we have identified eight candidate proteins of interest including SERPINA3K, which may be important in the pathology of T2DM and/or diabetic retinopathy.

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 32 patients with severe obesity (16 males and 16 females) of Central European descent who underwent bariatric surgery. Clinical parameters and body composition were assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioelectrical impedance, with 15 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 17 with hypertension. Paired SAT and VAT samples, along with serum samples, were subjected to state-of-the-art proteomics liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Our analysis identified 7,284 proteins across SAT and VAT, with 1,249 differentially expressed proteins between the tissues and 1,206 proteins identified in serum. Correlation analyses between differential protein expression and clinical traits suggest a significant role of SAT in the pathogenesis of obesity and related metabolic complications. Specifically, the SAT proteomic profile revealed marked alterations in metabolic pathways and processes contributing to tissue fibrosis and inflammation. Although we do not establish a definitive causal relationship, it appears that VAT might respond to SAT metabolic dysfunction by potentially enhancing mitochondrial activity and expanding its capacity. However, when this adaptive response is exceeded, it could possibly contribute to insulin resistance (IR) and in some cases, it may be associated with the progression to T2D. Our findings provide critical insights into the molecular foundations of SAT and VAT in obesity and may inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study provides insights into distinct proteomic profiles of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and serum in patients with severe obesity and their associations with clinical traits and body composition. It underscores SAT's crucial role in obesity development and related complications, such as insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our findings emphasize the importance of understanding the SAT and VAT balance in energy homeostasis, proteostasis, and the potential role of SAT capacity in the development of metabolic disorders.;;"Masaryk University Brno; Masaryk University Brno; Masaryk University Brno; University Hospital Ostrava; University of Ostrava; Masaryk University Brno; University of Ostrava; Masaryk University Brno";;;;;;;;;;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 4;2023;325;5;;;;;E562;E580;;10.1152/ajpendo.00153.2023;http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00153.2023;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001104868800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Vitamin D (VD) has antidiabetic effects. However, the protective mechanism of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) on T2DM is still unclear. Methods: A rat model of T2DM was constructed using a high-fat diet combined with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Glucose tolerance was assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Insulin secretion in blood and cell supernatant was determined by ELISA. Cell viability was analysed by CCK-8 assay. The level of ROS was detected by the DCFH-DA fluorescent probe method. The iron level in pancreatic tissues and cells was detected by an iron assay kit. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression of the pancreatic beta cell marker CD49a. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of ferroptosis pathway-related proteins and vitamin D receptor (VDR) were detected by western blot. Downstream VDR targets were screened by proteomic sequencing. Results: The DM group had increased glucose levels and decreased insulin secretion, while 1,25D treatment decreased glucose levels and increased insulin secretion. 1,25D also suppressed DM-induced ferroptosis in pancreatic tissues in vivo. In addition, 1,25D significantly enhanced the viability of pancreatic beta cells and reduced the levels of ROS and iron. 1,25D significantly upregulated the expression of VDR and the ferroptosis-related pathway protein GPX4 and downregulated the expression of ACSL4. Furthermore, knockdown of VDR reversed the effects of 1,25D on cell viability, ROS and iron levels, and ferroptosis-related protein expression in pancreatic beta cells. Proteomic sequencing revealed that FOXO1 was the downstream target gene of VDR. Knockdown of FOXO1 reduced pancreatic beta cell death, decreased ROS, iron and ACSL4 levels, and increased GPX4 levels. Conclusion: 1,25D/VDR inhibited pancreatic beta cell ferroptosis in T2DM by downregulating the expression of FOXO1. This study provides a new theoretical basis for basic research on T2DM and is expected to establish a new idea for the treatment of T2DM.;;Chongqing University;;;;;;;;;;21;21;;;;;;;;;;;MAY;2023;105;;;;;;;;110564;10.1016/j.cellsig.2022.110564;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2022.110564;;JAN 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000925671700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

P-glycoprotein function at the BBB was reduced at 2weeks. In the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, neurofilament, which is important for neuronal function, was decreased in HFD mice at 2weeks, but recovered at 10weeks.ConclusionOur results suggest that changes in the status of insulin resistance influence expression of BBB transporters, which in turn may alter the expression of cognitive function-related proteins.;;"Kumamoto University; Kumamoto University";;;;;;;;;;34;36;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2019;36;10;;;;;;;141;10.1007/s11095-019-2674-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11095-019-2674-8;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000478094900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Previously, our group used shotgun proteomics to identify multiple rodent adipocytokines and secreted proteins whose levels are modulated upon the induction of IR by indirectly and directly modulating O-GIcNAc levels. We have validated the relative levels of several of these factors using immunoblotting. Since adipocytokines levels are regulated primarily at the level of transcription and O-GIcNAc alters the function of many transcription factors, we hypothesized that elevated O-GIcNAc levels on key transcription factors are modulating secreted protein expression. Here, we show that upon the elevation of O-GIcNAc levels and the induction of IR in mature 3T3-F442a adipocytes, the transcript levels of multiple secreted proteins reflect the modulation observed at the protein level. We validate the transcript levels in male mouse models of diabetes. Using inguinal fat pads from the severely IR db/db mouse model and the mildly IR diet-induced mouse model, we have confirmed that the secreted proteins regulated by O-GIcNAc modulation in cell culture are likewise modulated in the whole animal upon a shift to IR. By comparing the promoters of similarly regulated genes, we determine that Spl is a common cis-acting element. Furthermore, we show that the LPL and SPARC promoters are enriched for Spl and O-GIcNAc modified proteins during insulin resistance in adipocytes. Thus, the O-GIcNAc modification of proteins bound to promoters, including Spl, is linked to adipocytokine transcription during insulin resistance.;;"University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; Augusta University";;;;;;;;;;15;19;;;;;;;;;;;JAN 22;2015;5;;;;;;;;223;10.3389/fendo.2014.00223;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2014.00223;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000378392800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present study, we investigated the possible candidates for diabetes-related proteins in the hippocampus of ZDF rats and their control littermates (Zucker lean control, ZLC), by using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Approximately 2756 protein spots were detected by 2D-DIGE, and an increase or decrease of more than 1.4-fold was observed for 13 proteins in the hippocampal homogenates of ZDF rats relative to those of ZLC rats. Among these proteins, we found four proteins whose levels were significantly lower in the hippocampi of ZDF rats than in those of ZLC rats: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), apolipoprotein A-I preprotein (apoAI-P), myelin basic protein (MBP), and rCG39881, isoform CRA_a. Among these proteins, apoAl-P protein levels were decreased most prominently in ZDF rats than in ZLC rats, based on Western blot analysis. In addition, immunohistochemical and Western blot studies demonstrated that MBP, not GFAP, immunoreactivity and protein levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of ZDF rats compared to ZLC rats. In addition, ultrastructural analysis showed that ZDF rats showed myelin degeneration and disarrangement in the hippocampal tissue. These results suggest that chronic type 2 diabetes affects hippocampal function via reduction of MBP and apoAI-P levels as well as disarrangement of myelin. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Proteomics is an ingenious and promising Omics technology that can comprehensively describe the global protein expression profiling of body or specific tissue, and is widely applied to the study of molecular mechanisms of diseases. In this paper, we focused on insulin target organs: adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle, and analyzed the different pathological processes of IR in these three tissues based on proteomics research. By literature studies, we proposed that the main pathological processes of IR among target organs were diverse, which showed unique characteristics and focuses. We further summarized the differential proteins in target organs which were verified to be related to IR, and discussed the proteins that may play key roles in the emphasized pathological processes, aiming at discovering potentially specific differential proteins of IR, and providing new ideas for pathological mechanism research of IR.;;"Beijing University of Chinese Medicine; Beijing University of Chinese Medicine";;;;;;;;;;5;6;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2020;235;10;;;;;6441;6461;;10.1002/jcp.29658;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcp.29658;;MAR 2020;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000517140400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In vitro exposure of beta -cells to the saturated free fatty acid palmitate is a valuable model of lipotoxicity, reproducing features of beta -cell failure observed in type 2 diabetes. In order to map the beta -cell response to lipotoxicity, we combined RNA-sequencing of palmitate-treated human islets with iTRAQ proteomics of insulin-secreting INS-1E cells following a time course exposure to palmitate.ResultsCrossing transcriptome and proteome of palmitate-treated beta -cells revealed 85 upregulated and 122 downregulated genes at both transcript and protein level. Pathway analysis identified lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, amino-acid metabolism and cell cycle pathways among the most enriched palmitate-modified pathways. Palmitate induced gene expression changes compatible with increased free fatty acid mitochondrial import and beta -oxidation, decreased lipogenesis and modified cholesterol transport. Palmitate modified genes regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function, ER-to-Golgi transport and ER stress pathways. Furthermore, palmitate modulated cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, inhibiting expression of PKA anchoring proteins and downregulating the GLP-1 receptor. SLC7 family amino-acid transporters were upregulated in response to palmitate but this induction did not contribute to beta -cell demise. To unravel critical mediators of lipotoxicity upstream of the palmitate-modified genes, we identified overrepresented transcription factor binding sites and performed network inference analysis. These identified LXR, PPAR alpha, FOXO1 and BACH1 as key transcription factors orchestrating the metabolic and oxidative stress responses to palmitate.ConclusionsThis is the first study to combine transcriptomic and sensitive time course proteomic profiling of palmitate-exposed beta -cells. Our results provide comprehensive insight into gene and protein expression changes, corroborating and expanding beyond previous findings. The identification of critical drivers and pathways of the beta -cell lipotoxic response points to novel therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes.;;"Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Sodersjukhuset Hospital; Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska Institutet; University of Pisa";;;;;;;;;;34;35;;;;;;;;;;;AUG 26;2020;21;1;;;;;;;590;10.1186/s12864-020-07003-0;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-07003-0;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000567172200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Importantly, these pathologies could induce synergetic alterations in the heart, and the discovery of key common molecular signaling may suggest new targets for therapy. Intraoperative cardiac biopsies were obtained from patients with coronary heart disease and preserved systolic function, with or without HTN and/or T2DM, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Control (n = 5), HTN (n = 7), and HTN + T2DM (n = 7) samples were analysed by proteomics and bioinformatics. Additionally, cultured rat cardiomyocytes were used for the analysis (protein level and activation, mRNA expression, and bioenergetic performance) of key molecular mediators under stimulation of main components of HTN and T2DM (high glucose and/or fatty acids and angiotensin-II). As results, in cardiac biopsies, we found significant alterations of 677 proteins and after filtering for non-cardiac factors, 529 and 41 were changed in HTN-T2DM and in HTN subjects, respectively, against the control. Interestingly, 81% of proteins in HTN-T2DM were distinct from HTN, while 95% from HTN were common with HTN-T2DM. In addition, 78 factors were differentially expressed in HTN-T2DM against HTN, predominantly downregulated proteins of mitochondrial respiration and lipid oxidation. Bioinformatic analyses suggested the implication of mTOR signaling and reduction of AMPK and PPAR alpha activation, and regulation of PGC1ff, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. In cultured cardiomyocytes, an excess of the palmitate activated mTORC1 complex and subsequent attenuation of PGC1 alpha-PPAR alpha transcription of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial electron chain factors affect mitochondrial/glycolytic ATP synthesis. Silencing of PGC1 ff further reduced total ATP and both mitochondrial and glycolytic ATP. Thus, the coexistence of HTN and T2DM induced higher alterations in cardiac proteins than HTN. HTN-T2DM subjects exhibited a marked downregulation of mitochondrial respiration and lipid metabolism and the mTORC1-PGC1 alpha-PPAR alpha axis might account as a target for therapeutical strategies.;;"Autonomous University of Madrid; Fundacion Jimenez Diaz; CIC bioGUNE; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBEREHD; CIBERDEM; CIC bioGUNE; Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre; Autonomous University of Madrid";;;;;;;;;;3;3;;;;;;;;;;;MAY 11;2023;24;10;;;;;;;8629;10.3390/ijms24108629;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms24108629;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000996568700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Unfortunately, current diagnostic markers do not meet these needs. Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) offers a solution for clinical diagnosis, providing reliable and precise sample quantification. This study utilized DIA-MS to investigate proteomic differential expression in the serum of recently diagnosed T2DM patients. The study conducted a comparative protein expression analysis between healthy and recently diagnosed T2DM groups (discovery cohort). A candidate protein was then validated using enzyme-linked immune assay (ELISA) on serum samples collected from T2DM patients (n=87) and healthy control (n=60) (validation cohort). A total of 1074 proteins were identified, and 90 were significantly dysregulated between the two groups, including 32 newly associated with T2DM. Among these proteins, the expression of S100 calcium-binding protein A6 (S100A6) was validated by ELISA. It showed a significant increase in T2DM samples compared to the control group. It was evaluated as a biomarker using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, consistent with the DIA-MS results. Novel proteins are reported to be involved in the development and progression of T2DM.

Cross-omics technologies by virtue of a wide spectrum screening of plasma samples have the potential to identify biomarkers for the refinement of prognosis in addition to clinical variables. Here we utilized proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics panel assay measurements in baseline plasma samples from the multinational PROVALID study (PROspective cohort study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for VALIDation of biomarkers) of patients with incident or early chronic kidney disease (median follow-up 35 months, median baseline eGFR 84 mL/min/1.73 m(2), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 8.1 mg/g). In an accelerated case-control study, 258 individuals with a stable eGFR course (median eGFR change 0.1 mL/min/year) were compared to 223 individuals with a rapid eGFR decline (median eGFR decline -6.75 mL/min/year) using Bayesian multivariable logistic regression models to assess the discrimination of eGFR trajectories. The analysis included 402 candidate predictors and showed two protein markers (KIM-1, NTproBNP) to be relevant predictors of the eGFR trajectory with baseline eGFR being an important clinical covariate. The inclusion of metabolomic and lipidomic platforms did not improve discrimination substantially. Predictions using all available variables were statistically indistinguishable from predictions using only KIM-1 and baseline eGFR (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.63).

However, research specifically focusing on the ratios of plasma proteins in type 2 diabetes remains relatively scarce.MethodsThis study primarily employed a two-sample, two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, leveraging genetic data from several large, publicly accessible genome-wide association studies, wherein single nucleotide polymorphisms served as proxies for exposures and diseases. Within this framework, we applied two-sample MR to assess the associations between the 2821 plasma protein-to-protein ratios and type 2 diabetes along with its complications and utilized reverse MR to confirm the unidirectionality of these causal relationships. In addition, we employed two-step MR to investigate the potential mediating role of body mass index in these associations. To augment the robustness of our findings, we systematically implemented a series of sensitivity analyses.ResultsThe results gleaned from the inverse-variance weighted method elucidated that a cumulative sum of 23 protein-to-protein ratios bore a causal nexus with type 2 diabetes across both sample cohorts. With each incremental elevation of 1 standard deviation in the genetically anticipated protein-to-protein ratio, the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes oscillated from 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.87, 1.00) for the CNTN3/NCSS1 protein level ratio to 1.13 (1.06, 1.22) for the DBNL/NCK2 protein level ratio. Moreover, a tally of eight protein-to-protein ratios correlated with a minimum of one complication linked to type 2 diabetes. Diverse sensitivity analyses corroborated the robustness of these observations.ConclusionsThe outcomes of our investigation unveiled correlations between 23 plasma protein-to-protein ratios and type 2 diabetes, with eight of these ratios entwined with complications of type 2 diabetes. These discoveries offer novel perspectives on the diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes and its associated complications.;;"Southwest Medical University; Southwest Medical University";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2024;26;10;;;;;4410;4417;;10.1111/dom.15792;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/dom.15792;;JUL 2024;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001270402700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Coimmunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells showed that MR is a target of O-GlcNAc modification (O-GlcNAcylation). The expression levels and transcriptional activities of the receptor increased in parallel with its O-GlcNAcylation under high-glucose conditions. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed O-GlcNAcylation of the MR at amino acids 295-307. Point mutations in those residues decreased O-GlcNAcylation, and both the protein levels and transcriptional activities of MR. In db/db mouse kidneys, MR protein levels increased in parallel with overall O-GlcNAc levels of the tissue, accompanied by increased SGK1 mRNA levels. The administration of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucin, an inhibitor of O-GlcNAcylation, reduced tissue O-GlcNAc levels and MR protein levels in db/db mice. Thus, our study showed that O-GlcNAcylation of the MR directly increases protein levels and transcriptional activities of the receptor under high-glucose conditions in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide a novel mechanism of MR as a target for prevention of complications associated with diabetes mellitus.;;"Keio University; Oita University; National Defense Medical College - Japan; Saint Marianna University; Keio University; Keio University";;;;;;;;;;16;17;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2023;46;1;;;;;19;31;;10.1038/s41440-022-01036-6;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41440-022-01036-6;;OCT 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000867591900012;View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present research work, the levels of urinary protein biomarkers of diabetes mellitus type 2 using proteomic technology have been identified and characterized. Effect of high dose thiamine has also been observed on the levels of these marker proteins. Above 100 type 2 diabetic patients, and 50 same age and sex-matched normal healthy controls were recruited from the Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan and 40 diabetic and 20 control have completed the trial. The urine samples from control and diabetic groups before or after thiamine therapy were further analyzed and identified by 2-D liquid chromatographic system (HPLC) and mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF/TOF and microTOF analysis. All the samples belonging to the control and diabetic groups were then analyzed by ELISA and estimated the levels of some proteins which were found to vary. In the urine samples, the levels of transthyretin, AMBP, haptoglobin precursor were found to decrease while albumin, zinc a 2 glycoprotein, RBP4 and E cadherin were found to increase in the diabetic patients as compared to the controls. The level of albumin in the urine samples of diabetic patients only decreased by 34% after thiamine therapy as compared to the controls and the placebo, while other urinary protein markers did not show a significant change after the therapy. Assessment of the levels of these biomarkers will be helpful in the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This is due, in part, to the fact that current methods for assessing beta-cell function are inaccurate, prone to error, labor-intensive, or affected by glucose-lowering therapy. The aim of the current study was to identify novel circulating biomarkers to monitor beta-cell function and to identify individuals at high risk of developing beta-cell dysfunction. In a nested case-control study from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) cohort (n = 1157), proteomics and miRNA profiling were performed on fasting plasma samples from 43 individuals who progressed to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 43 controls who maintained normal glucose tolerance (NGT) over three years. Groups were matched at baseline for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), insulin sensitivity (euglycemic clamp) and beta-cell glucose sensitivity (mathematical modeling). Proteomic profiling was performed using the SomaLogic platform (Colorado, USA); miRNA expression was performed using a modified RT-PCR protocol (Regulus Therapeutics, California, USA). Results showed differentially expressed proteins and miRNAs including some with known links to type 2 diabetes, such as adiponectin, but also novel biomarkers and pathways. In cross sectional analysis at year 3, the top differentially expressed biomarkers in people with IGT/reduced beta-cell glucose sensitivity were adiponectin, alpha1-antitrypsin (known to regulate adiponectin levels), endocan, miR-181a, miR-342, and miR-323. At baseline, adiponectin, cathepsin D and NCAM.L1 (proteins expressed by pancreatic beta-cells) were significantly lower in those that progressed to IGT. Many of the novel prognostic biomarker candidates were within the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway: for example, Noggin, DLL4 and miR-181a. Further validation studies are required in additional clinical cohorts and in patients with type 2 diabetes, but these results identify novel pathways and biomarkers that may have utility in monitoring beta-cell function and/or predicting future decline, allowing more targeted efforts to prevent and intercept type 2 diabetes.";;"Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica (IFC-CNR); University of Glasgow";;;;;;;;;;45;50;;;;;;;;;;;AUG 28;2017;12;8;;;;;;;e0182932;10.1371/journal.pone.0182932;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0182932;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000408438600019;View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: Proteomic surveying and accurate quantitative measurement of selected proteins from plasma samples collected from the patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who gave birth of either healthy or affected by maternal diabetes newborns was performed using mass spectrometry. Results: We determined and quantitatively measured several proteins, including CRP, CEACAM1, CNDP1 and Ig-family that were significantly differed in patients that gave birth of newborns with signs of DF. We found that patients with newborns associated with DF are characterized by significantly decreased CEACAM1 (113.18 +/- 16.23 ng/mL and 81.09 +/- 10.54 ng/mL in GDM and T2DM, p < 0.005) in contrast to control group (515.6 +/- 72.14 ng/mL, p < 0.005). On the contrary, the concentration of CNDP1 was increased in DF-associated groups and attained 49.3 +/- 5.18 ng/mL and 37.7 +/- 3.34 ng/mL (p < 0.005) in GDM and T2DM groups, respectively. Among other proteins, dramatically decreased concentration of IgG4 and IgA2 subclasses of immunoglobulins were noticed.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of the unsaturated free fatty acid oleate in glucolipotoxicity and to unravel the molecular pathways involved. INS-1E cells were exposed to 0.5 mM oleate, combined or not with 25 mM glucose, for 24 h. Protein profiling of INS-1E cells was done by 2D-DIGE, covering pH ranges 4-7 and 6-9 (n = 4). Identification of differentially expressed proteins (P < 0.05) was based on MALDI-TOF analysis using Peptide Mass Fingerprint (PMF) and fragmentation (MS/MS) of the most intense peaks of PMF and proteomic results were confirmed by functional assays. Oleate impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and decreased insulin content. 2D-DIGE analysis revealed 53 and 54 differentially expressed proteins for oleate and the combination of oleate and high glucose, respectively. Exposure to oleate down-regulated chaperones, hampered insulin processing and ubiquitin-related proteasomal degradation, and induced perturbations in vesicle transport and budding. In combination with high glucose, shunting of excess amounts of glucose toward reactive oxygen species production worsened beta cell death.

Screening of plasma biomarkers has great significance of optimizing diagnosis and predicting the complications of T2DM. Methods We used a special diet, Purina #5008, to induce diabetes in Zucker leptin receptor gene-deficient rats (fa/fa) to establish Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, simulating the early stage of T2DM. The differentially expressed proteins (DEP) and lipids (DEL), as potential biomarkers, were screened to compare the plasma expression levels in ZDF rats and their basic diet-fed wild-type controls (fa/+) by Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results These two groups had different plasma proteins and lipids profiles consisting of 84 DEPs and, 179 DELs identified in the positive ion mode and 178 DELs in the negative ion mode, respectively. Enrichment analysis of these different indicators showed that oxidative stress, insulin resistance and metabolic disorders of glycan and lipid played an important role in generating the difference. Some markers can be used as candidate biomarkers in prediction and treatments of T2DM, such as ceruloplasmin, apolipoprotein C-I, apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein C-IV. Conclusion These plasma differences help to optimize the diagnosis and predict the complications of T2DM, although this remains to be verified in the crowd. Trace elements related-metalloproteins, such as ceruloplasmin, and lipid metabolism and transport-related apolipoprotein C are expected to be candidate biomarkers of T2DM and should be given more attention.;;"Shandong University; Shandong University; Shandong University; Shandong University";;;;;;;;;;8;9;;;;;;;;;;;AUG 12;2020;17;1;;;;;;;66;10.1186/s12986-020-00488-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12986-020-00488-2;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000562795000003;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, their role in the interaction between COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes (T2D) has not been addressed. Here, we characterized the circulating EV proteomic and phosphoproteomic landscape in patients with and without T2D hospitalized with COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 acute respiratory illness (RSP). We detected differentially expressed protein and phosphoprotein signatures that effectively characterized the study groups. The trio of immunomodulatory and coagulation proteins C1QA, C1QB, and C1QC appeared to be a central cluster in both the COVID-19 and T2D functional networks. PKC beta appeared to be retained in cells by being diverted from EV pathways and contribute to the COVID-19 and T2D interaction via a PKC/BTK/TEC axis. EV-shuttled CASP3 and ROCK1 appeared to be coregulated and likely contribute to disease interactions in patients with COVID-19 and T2D. Predicted activation of AMPK, MAPK, and SYF appeared to also play important roles driving disease interaction.

How to prevent and cure T2DM has become one of the urgent public health events in China. Numerous studies have demonstrated vitamin D (VitD) was independently correlated with insulin sensitivity and beta cells function. VitD deficiency occurs in about 70% to 80% of patients with T2DM. However, the reason of T2DM patients suffering from VitD deficiency is not very clear. The aim of this project is to identify biomarkers to explore potential mechanism of VitD deficiency in patients with T2DM.MethodsWe used the iTRAQ-coupled LC-MS/MS technique to screen differential expression proteins between VitD deficiency group and VitD sufficiency group in T2DM patients. Then we carried out hierarchical clustering analysis, Gene Ontology classification and enrichment analysis, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network (PPI) analysis and ELISA validation.ResultsWe identified 63 differentially expressed proteins, 17 proteins were up-regulated and 46 proteins were down-regulated (VitD sufficiency vs. VitD deficiency). We ultimately selected four proteins, Podocalyxin (PODXL), ICAM3, MMP9, ApoF for further verification. As a result, the level of MMP9 and ICAM3 was higher in VitD sufficiency group than VitD deficiency group.ConclusionsOur study provided a solid theoretical foundation for the study of biomarkers and their mechanisms in most patients with T2DM who suffer from vitamin D deficiency.

Many proteomic studies have been performed in the context of diabetes research, with the aims of both describing the healthy tissue and to unravel the complex pathophysiology behind the disease. In addition, effects on proteins induced by different treatments have also been investigated using proteomic approaches. In this paper the field of diabetes proteomics today will be reviewed.

Fortunately, various omics tools have been employed to better understand the progression pathologies of T2DM and its complications. More specifically, proteomics, metabolomics and metagenomics have played crucial roles in advancing deeper understanding of the physiological processes and regulatory mechanisms of T2DM, such as regulation of signaling pathways perturbed by glucose levels, intestinal microorganism, and inflammation and so on. By analyzing the dynamic change and modification of proteins, proteomics has become an important tool in biology and medicine. Metabolomic analysis can amplify and quantify metabolites in living organisms to reveal the relative relationship between metabolites and physiological and pathological changes. There are also increasing evidences that the human microbiome, specifically the gastrointestinal microbiome have a potential role in the etiology and pathological outcomes of T2DM and its complications. This article summarized and discussed the recent applications of these omics tools in finding biomarkers for T2DM and its complications.

Here, we test relationships between 1,468 Olink protein levels and the incidence of 23 age-related diseases and mortality in the UK Biobank (n = 47,600). We report 3,209 associations between 963 protein levels and 21 incident outcomes. Next, protein-based scores (ProteinScores) are developed using penalized Cox regression. When applied to test sets, six ProteinScores improve the area under the curve estimates for the 10-year onset of incident outcomes beyond age, sex and a comprehensive set of 24 lifestyle factors, clinically relevant biomarkers and physical measures. Furthermore, the ProteinScore for type 2 diabetes outperforms a polygenic risk score and HbA1c-a clinical marker used to monitor and diagnose type 2 diabetes. The performance of scores using metabolomic and proteomic features is also compared. These data characterize early proteomic contributions to major age-related diseases, demonstrating the value of the plasma proteome for risk stratification.

This study aimed to explore the complement system, as well as cortisol and ACTH responses in patients with post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Patients and Methods: This study recruited 31 patients with PCC and T2DM (PCC-T2DM), 19 patients with PCC (PCC), 10 patients with T2DM (T2DM), and 10 healthy participants (control). Cortisol and ACTH in the PCC and PCC-T2DM groups were assessed using the insulin tolerance test. In the fasting state, serum samples were collected for proteomic analyses. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between proteins and cortisol, as well as between proteins and ACTH. Results: Cortisol and ACTH levels were consistently decreased in the PCC and PCC-T2DM groups. Proteomic analyses revealed that most of the differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in the PCC vs control and PCC-T2DM vs T2DM were involved in the coagulation and complement cascade, and the essential complement C3 was significantly upregulated in the PCC and PCC-T2DM groups when compared to their controls. Additionally, complement-related DAPs in the PCC vs control and PCC-T2DM vs T2DM were significantly correlated with cortisol and ACTH levels. In comparing PCC-T2DM samples with PCC samples, we found that upregulated DAPs were linked to the complement system and other immune system, and most DAPs were negatively correlated with cortisol and ACTH. Conclusion: Our study revealed that T2DM exacerbated dysregulation of the complement system in patients with PCC, and significant correlations were present between complement protein levels and those of cortisol and ACTH.

However, its mechanism of action is still unclear at the metabolic level. In this study, the biochemical markers from type 2 DM (T2DM) rats, induced by a high-sugar and high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin (STZ), were detected. The metabolomics-based analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was conducted to evaluate urine samples from control, model, metformin, and HD groups. After oral administration of HD for 28 days, the general state, weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood lipid level, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), fasting insulin (FINS), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly improved (P<0.01). The western blotting showed that HD can enhance the protein expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The metabolomics results revealed that after treatment with HD, the levels of L-carnitine, 1-methyladenosine, 1-methylhistamine, and 3-indoleacrylic acid were upregulated and the levels of riboflavin, phenylalanine, atrolactic acid, 2-oxoglutarate, citrate, isocitrate, cortisol, and glucose were downregulated. The main mechanism may be closely related to the regulation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, phenylalanine metabolism, glyoxylate metabolism, and dicarboxylate metabolism. Additionally, it was also found that HD can regulate the protein expression of GLUT4 and AMPK to interfere with TCA cycle and carbohydrate metabolism to treat T2DM.;;"Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Southern Medical University - China";;;;;;;;;;8;10;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 30;2019;2019;;;;;;;;1394641;10.1155/2019/1394641;http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/1394641;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000497349000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

We aim to explore urinary biomarkers that could monitor CAD in type 2 diabetic patients. Materials and Methods. Urine samples from two groups, twenty-eight type 2 diabetic patients with coexisting CAD and thirty type 2 diabetic patients without CAD, were purified by MB-WCX and then analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Subsequently, we compared the urinary peptide signatures of the two groups by use of ClinProTools2.1 and evaluated the potential ability of the differently expressed peptides to distinguish type 2 diabetic patients with coexisting CAD from type 2 diabetic patients without CAD by ROC analysis. Finally, the differently expressed peptides were identified by nanoliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results. There were six differently expressed peptides (m/z 1305.2, 1743.9, 2184.9, 2756.1, 3223.2, and 6196.1) between the two groups of subjects, and they were identified as fragments of isoform 1 of fibrinogen alpha chain precursor, prothrombin precursor, and interalpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4. The diagnostic efficacy of m/z 2756.1 and m/z 3223.2 was better than the other peptides. Area under ROC of the m/z 2756.1, and m/z 3223.2 was 0.98 and 0.93, respectively. Conclusions.

In order to elucidate the pathophysiological processes leading to type 2 diabetes, we aimed to identify protein biomarkers associated with prediabetes. Methods In a proteomics study, we used targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM)-MS to quantify 23 candidate proteins in the plasma of 439 randomly selected men and women aged 47-76 years from the population-based German KORA F4 study. Cross-sectional associations of protein levels with prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance), type 2 diabetes, glucose levels in both the fasting state and 2 h after an OGTT, fasting insulin and insulin resistance were investigated using regression models adjusted for technical covariables, age, sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol intake, physical inactivity, actual hypertension, triacylglycerol levels, total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. Results Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase 1 (MASP1; OR per SD 1.77 [95% CI 1.26, 2.47]), thrombospondin 1 (THBS1; OR per SD 1.55 [95% CI 1.16, 2.07]) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D1 (GPLD1; OR per SD 1.40 [95% CI 1.01, 1.94]) were positively associated with prediabetes, and apolipoprotein A-IV (ApoA-IV; OR per SD 0.75 [95% CI 0.56, 1.00]) was inversely associated with prediabetes. MASP1 was positively associated with fasting and 2 h glucose levels. ApoA-IV was inversely and THBS1 was positively associated with 2 h glucose levels. MASP1 associations with prediabetes and fasting glucose resisted Bonferroni correction. Type 2 diabetes associations were partly influenced by glucose-lowering medication.

It is composed of Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi (ge gen), Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (huang qin), Coptidis chinensis Franch. (huang lian), and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. (gan cao). However, the active ingredients in GQD and their mechanism of action are unclear. Aim of the study: In this study, we aimed to verify the efficacy of GQD in improving insulin resistance (IR) in diabetic mice and used network pharmacology to identify potential targets and pathways underlying its mech-anism of action. Materials and methods: A mouse model of diabetes was created by feeding mice a high-fat diet followed by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. These type II diabetic mice were administered either a clinical dose or a high dose of GQD, after which blood glucose and serum insulin levels were measured to assess its effects on IR. Network pharmacology was used to construct a 'component-pathway-target' network to elucidate the likely targets and pathways modulated in common by GQD components. Furthermore, mRNA transcript levels and protein expression levels of oestrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) were determined. Results: The in vivo experiment showed that GQD markedly decreased blood glucose and increased serum insulin levels in type II diabetic mice. Network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis indicated that GQD regulated 82 corresponding proteins and 59 relevant biological pathways associated with diabetes. One such target was ESR1, which was significantly decreased at both the mRNA and protein levels in diabetic mice, but whose levels were significantly increased by GQD treatment. Conclusions: This project provides a scientific basis for understanding the effectiveness of multi-component, multi-target compound formulas, as well as a new strategy for investigating therapeutic drugs for type II dia-betes and other diseases.;;"Harbin Medical University; Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine";;;;;;;;;;28;30;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 15;2020;262;;;;;;;;113129;10.1016/j.jep.2020.113129;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.113129;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000569286400003;View Full Record in Web of Science

The study aimed to explore the mechanism of mulberry leaf in the treatment of T2DM through tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics analysis of skeletal muscle.MethodsThe anti-diabetic activity of mulberry leaf extract (MLE) was evaluated by using streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats at a dose of 4.0 g crude drug /kg p.o. daily for 8 weeks. Fasting blood glucose, body weight, food and water intake were monitored at specific intervals, and oral glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test were conducted at the 7th and 8th week respectively. At the end of the experiment, levels of glycated hemoglobin A1c, insulin, free fat acid, leptin, adiponectin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were assessed and the pathological changes of rat skeletal muscle were observed by HE staining. TMT-based quantitative proteomic analysis of skeletal muscle and bioinformatics analysis were performed and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were validated by western blot. The interactions between the components of MLE and DEPs were further assessed using molecular docking.ResultsAfter 8 weeks of MLE intervention, the clinical indications of T2DM such as body weight, food and water intake of rats were improved to a certain extent, while insulin sensitivity was increased and glycemic control was improved. Serum lipid profiles were significantly reduced, and the skeletal muscle fiber gap and atrophy were alleviated. Proteomic analysis of skeletal muscle showed that MLE treatment reversed 19 DEPs in T2DM rats, regulated cholesterol metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, vitamin digestion and absorption and ferroptosis signaling pathways. Key differential proteins Apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA1) and ApoA4 were successfully validated by western blot and exhibited strong binding activity to the MLE's ingredients.ConclusionsThis study first provided skeletal muscle proteomic changes in T2DM rats before and after MLE treatment, which may help us understand the molecular mechanisms, and provide a foundation for developing potential therapeutic targets of anti-T2DM of MLE.;;"Beijing University of Chinese Medicine; Qingdao Municipal Hospital; University of Health & Rehabilitation Sciences; Beijing University of Chinese Medicine; Beijing University of Chinese Medicine; Beijing University of Chinese Medicine";;;;;;;;;;3;3;;;;;;;;;;;SEP 4;2023;23;1;;;;;;;308;10.1186/s12906-023-04140-3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-023-04140-3;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001059752800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

We analyzed the monocyte proteome for potential markers that would enhance the ability to screen for early inflammatory status in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), using proteomic technologies. Monocytic cells (THP-1) were primed with high glucose (HG), their protein profiles were analyzed using 2DE and the downregulated differentially expressed spots were identified using MALDI TOF/MS. We selected five proteins that were secretory in function with the help of bioinformatic programs. A predominantly downregulated protein identified as cyclophilin A (sequence coverage 98%) was further validated by immunoblotting experiments. The cellular mRNA levels of cyclophilin A in various HG-primed cells were studied using qRT-PCR assays and it was observed to decrease in a dose-dependent manner. LC-ESI-MS was used to identify this protein in the conditioned media of HG-primed cells and confirmed by Western blotting as well as ELISA. Cyclophilin A was also detected in the plasma of patients with diabetes. We conclude that cyclophilin A is secreted by monocytes in response to HG. Given the paracrine and autocrine actions of cyclophilin A, the secreted immunophilin could be significant for progression of atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes.

Gastrocnemius muscle, white and brown adipose tissue, and liver were taken from C57BL/6 mice either fed on a high-fat or a chow diet. Expression levels of approximately 10 000 polypeptides for all the four tissues were assessed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Computer-assisted image analysis allowed the detection of 50 significantly (p < 0.05) differentially expressed proteins between obese and lean mice. Interestingly, more than half of these proteins were detected in the brown adipose tissue. The differentially expressed proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Several stress and redox proteins were modulated in response to the high-fat diet. A key glycolytic enzyme was found to be downregulated in adipose tissues and muscle, suggesting that at elevated plasma fatty acid concentrations, fatty acids compete with glucose as an oxidative fuel source. Furthermore, in brown adipose tissue there were significant changes in mitochondrial enzymes involved in the Krebs tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and in the respiratory chain in response to the high-fat diet. The brown adipose tissue is an energy-dissipating tissue.

In recent years, increasing evidence has emerged for the role of galectin-1 in obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Galectin-1 has been highly conserved through evolution and is involved in key cellular functions such as tissue maturation and homeostasis. It has been shown that galectin-1 increases in obesity, both in the circulation and in the adipose tissue of human and animal models. Several proteomic studies have independently identified an increased galectin-1 expression in the adipose tissue in obesity and in insulin resistance. Large population-based cohorts have demonstrated associations for circulating galectin-1 and markers of insulin resistance and incident type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, galectin-1 is associated with key metabolic pathways including glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as insulin signalling and inflammation. Intervention studies in animal models alter animal weight and metabolic profile. Several studies have also linked galectin-1 to the progression of complications in diabetes, including kidney disease and retinopathy.

A total of 53 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in T2DM-MCI compared with T2DM-nMCI patients. These DEPs were significantly enriched in multiple biological processes, such as amyloid neuropathies, CNS disorders, and metabolic acidosis. Among the DEPs, alpha-1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1), major viral protein (PRNP), and valosin-containing protein (VCP) showed strong correlation with AD high-risk genes APP, MAPT, APOE, PSEN1, and PSEN2. Also, the levels of PP2A cancer inhibitor (CIP2A), PRNP, corticotropin-releasing factor-binding protein (CRHBP) were significantly increased, while the level of VCP was decreased in T2DM-MCI patients compared with that of the T2DM-nMCI, and these changes were correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Further machine learning data showed that increases in PRNP, CRHBP, VCP, and rGSK-3 beta(T/S9) (ratio of total to serine-9-phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta) had the greatest power to identify mild cognitive decline in T2DM patients.;;"Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Jiangnan University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Zunyi Medical University; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Nantong University";;;;;;;;;;3;3;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 24;2022;10;;;;;;;;818141;10.3389/fcell.2022.818141;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2022.818141;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000894816200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Materials and Methods We compared the success rates between patients with and without T2DM during the healing period at our center. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were cultured from subjects. Proteomics was used to detect differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) among the DM failure (DM-F), DM success (DM-S), and control (Con) groups. The correlation between the expression levels of nine target DEPs and medium glucose concentrations was investigated. Results Higher failure rates were observed in the T2DM patients. Fifty-two DEPs were found between the DM-F and DM-S groups. Seventy-three DEPs were found between the DM-F and Con groups. Forty-three DEPs were found between the DM-S and Con groups. Five target DEPs were expressed at the same levels in the medium with different glucose concentrations. Gene ontology annotation and functional enrichment analysis suggest that the DEPs detected in the DM-F group may affect the biological function and regulatory potential of BMSCs. Conclusions The DEPs detected in the DM-F group can be intervention targets for to prevent implant failure in T2DM patients.

Currently, it is believed that the interaction between intestinal microbiota and bile acids (BAs) metabolism mediates host metabolism and promotes T2DM. Purpose: To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of JTSH for treating T2DM with animal models. Methods: In this study, male SD rats received high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) injection to induce T2DM and were treated with different dosages (0.27, 0.54 and 1.08 g/kg) of JTSH pill for 4 weeks; metformin was given as a positive control. Alterations of gut microbiota and BA profiles in the distal ileum were assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), respectively. Additionally, we conducted quantitative Real Time-PCR and western blotting to determine the mRNA and protein expression levels of intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR), fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) as well as hepatic cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily a, poly-peptide 1 (CYP7A1) and cytochrome P450, family 8, subfamily b, poly-peptide 1 (CYP8B1), which are involved in BAs metabolism and enterohepatic circulation. Results: Here, the results revealed that JTSH treatment significantly ameliorated hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance (IR), hyperlipidaemia, and pathological changes in the pancreas, liver, kidney and intestine and reduced the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in T2DM model rats. 16S rRNA sequencing and UPLC-MS/MS showed that JTSH treatment could modulate gut microbiota dysbiosis by preferentially increasing bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium) with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity, which might in turn lead to the accumulation of ileal unconjugated BAs (e.g., CDCA, DCA) and further upregulate the intestinal FXR/FGF15 and TGR5/GLP-1 signaling pathways. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that JTSH treatment could alleviate T2DM by modulating the interaction between gut microbiota and BAs metabolism. These findings suggest that JTSH pill may serve as a promising oral therapeutic agent for T2DM.";;"Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine; Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine; Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine; Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine; Shandong University";;;;;;;;;;28;29;;;;;;;;;;;MAY;2023;113;;;;;;;;154733;10.1016/j.phymed.2023.154733;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2023.154733;;MAR 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000950852800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Impaired GSIS was observed from INS-1E cells cultured for 5 days at 20 or 27 mM glucose compared to cells cultured at 5.5 or 11 mM glucose. After culture, mitochondria were isolated from the INS-1E cells by differential centrifugation. Proteins of the mitochondrial fraction were bound to a strong anionic surface (SAX2) protein array and mass spectra generated by SELDI-TOF-MS. Analysis of the spectra revealed proteins with expression levels that correlated with the glucose concentration of the culture medium. Indeed, such differentially expressed proteins created patterns of protein changes, which correlated with impairment of GSIS.

First published October 19, 2010; doi: 10.1152/ajpendo.00308.2010.-Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. To date, the molecular mechanisms of DN remain largely unclear. The present study aimed to identify and characterize novel proteins involved in the development of DN by a proteomic approach. Proteomic analysis revealed that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase 2 (HMGCS2), the key enzyme in ketogenesis, was increased fourfold in the kidneys of type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Consistently, the activity of HMGCS2 in kidneys and 24-h urinary excretion of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-HB) were significantly increased in db/db mice. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and real-time PCR studies further demonstrated that HMGCS2 was highly expressed in renal glomeruli of db/db mice, with weak expression in the kidneys of control mice. Because filtered ketone bodies are mainly reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, we used RPTC cells, a rat proximal tubule cell line, to examine the effect of the increased level of ketone bodies. Treating cultured RPTC cells with 1 mM beta-HB significantly induced transforming growth factor-beta 1 expression, with a marked increase in collagen I expression. beta-HB treatment also resulted in a marked increase in vimentin protein expression and a significant reduction in E-cadherin protein levels, suggesting an enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in RPTCs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that diabetic kidneys exhibit excess ketogenic activity resulting from increased HMGCS2 expression. Enhanced ketone body production in the diabetic kidney may represent a novel mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of DN.";;"Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI); Chinese Academy of Sciences";;;;;;;;;;62;69;;;;;;;;;;;FEB;2011;300;2;;;;;E287;E295;;10.1152/ajpendo.00308.2010;http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00308.2010;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000289011600004;View Full Record in Web of Science

To identify and quantify these metabolites, global and unbiased analysis of cellular metabolism is required. To this end, polar metabolites, extracted from the clonal 832/13 beta-cell line cultured at 2.8 and 16.7 mM glucose for 48 h, were derivatized followed by identification and quantification, using gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). After culture at 16.7 mM glucose for 48 h, 832/13 beta-cells exhibited a phenotype reminiscent of glucotoxicity with decreased content and secretion of insulin. The metabolomic analysis revealed alterations in the levels of 7 metabolites derived from glycolysis, the TCA cycle and pentose phosphate shunt, and 4 amino acids. Principal component analysis of the metabolite data showed two clusters, corresponding to the cells cultured at 2.8 and 16.7 mM glucose, respectively. Concurrent changes in protein expression were analyzed by 2-D gel electrophoresis followed by LC-MS/MS. The identities of 86 spots corresponding to 75 unique proteins that were significantly different in 832/13 beta-cells cultured at 16.7 mM glucose were established. Only 5 of these were found to be metabolic enzymes that could be involved in the metabolomic alterations observed. Anticipated changes in metabolite levels in cells exposed to increased glucose were observed, while changes in enzyme levels were much less profound. This suggests that substrate availability, allosteric regulation, and/or post-translational modifications are more important determinants of metabolite levels than enzyme expression at the protein level.;;"Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; Lund University";;;;;;;;;;45;53;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2008;7;1;;;;;400;411;;10.1021/pr070547d;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr070547d;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000252154200046;View Full Record in Web of Science

Higher-sensitivity proteomic methods (eg, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) have pushed the boundaries on the known urinary proteome to include more than 1,500 proteins. These same high-sensitivity methods have been applied toward profiling urinary peptides, which has resulted in methods to diagnostically screen urine to differentiate between type-2 diabetes mellitus and type-1 diabetes mellitus urine, normal versus microalbuminuria, or by angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment.

Whether these perturbations extend to other tissues and contribute to their pathophysiology is less well established. The objective of this study was to investigate platelet mitochondria to evaluate whether type 2 diabetes associated mitochondria( dysfunction is evident in circulating cells. Method: A pilot study of mitochondrial respiratory function and proteomic changes comparing platelets extracted from insulin sensitive (n=8) and type 2 diabetic subjects (n=7). Results: In-situ platelet mitochondria show diminished oxygen consumption and lower oxygen-dependent ATP synthesis in diabetic vs. control subjects. Mass spectrometric identification and confirmatory immunoblot analysis identifies induction of the mitochondrial anti-oxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase 2 and thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase 3 in platelets of diabetic subjects. As oxidative stress upregulates anti-oxidant enzymes we assessed mitochondrial protein carbonylation as an index of oxidative-stress. Platelets of diabetic subjects exhibit significantly increased protein carbonylation compared to controls. Conclusions: As platelets are anuclear fragments of megakaryocytes, our data suggest that the bone marrow compartment in type 2 diabetic subjects is exposed to increased mitochondrial oxidative stress with upregulation of nuclear-encoded antioxidant mitochondrial enzymes. This 'stress-signature' in platelets of diabetic subjects is associated with a diminution of their mitochondrial contribution to energy production and support that mitochondrial perturbations in type 2 diabetes extends beyond the classical insulin responsive tissues.

Epimedin C is considered one of the most important flavonoids in Epimedium, a famous edible herb in China and Southeast Asia that is traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat diabetes. In the present study, the therapeutic potential of epimedin C against T2DM was ascertained using a mouse model, and the mechanism underlying the hypoglycemic activity of epimedin C was explored using a label-free proteomic technique for the first time. Levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and oral glucose tolerance, as well as contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the 30 mgkg(-1) epimedin C group (EC30 group), were significantly lower than those in the model control group (MC group) (p < 0.05), while the contents of hepatic glycogen, insulin, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), as well as activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the EC30 group were notably higher than those in the MC group (p < 0.05). The structures of liver cells and tissues were greatly destroyed in the MC group, whereas the structures of cells and tissues were basically complete in the EC30 group, which were similar to those in the normal control group (NC group). A total of 92 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were enriched in the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. In the EC30 vs. MC groups, the expression level of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) was down-regulated, while the expression levels of group XIIB secretory phospholipase A2-like protein (Pla2g12b), apolipoprotein B-100 (Apob), and cytochrome P450 4A14 (Cyp4a14) were up-regulated. According to the KEGG pathway assay, Pck1 participated in the gluconeogenesis and insulin signaling pathways, and Pla2g12b, Apob, and Cyp4a14 were the key proteins in the fat digestion and fatty acid degradation pathways. Pck1, Pla2g12b, Apob, and Cyp4a14 seemed to play important roles in the prevention and treatment of T2DM. In summary, epimedin C inhibited Pck1 expression to maintain FBG at a relatively stable level, promoted Pla2g12b, Apob, and Cyp4a14 expressions to alleviate liver lipotoxicity, and protected liver tissues and cells from oxidant stress possibly by its phenolic hydroxyl groups.;;"Shaanxi Normal University; Xi'an Jiaotong University; Peoples Friendship University of Russia";;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2024;16;1;;;;;;;25;10.3390/nu16010025;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu16010025;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001141355600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Physical activities such as aerobic exercise play a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, metabolic pathways, oxidative stress, fibrosis, ECM remodeling, and muscle regeneration by modulating differentially expressed protein (DEP) levels. The objectives of our research were to investigate the effect of six weeks of aerobic exercise on the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle of db/db mice's DEP levels compared to those of sedentary db/db mice. A total of eight db/db mice were divided into two groups (n = 4 per group), namely sedentary mice (SED) and exercise-trained mice (ET), of which the latter were subjected to six weeks of a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention for five days per week. After the exercise intervention, biochemical tests, including analyses of blood glucose and HbA1c levels, were performed. Histological analysis using H & E staining on tissue was performed to compare morphological characters. Gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were dissected and processed for proteomic analysis. Data were provided and analyzed based on the DEPs using the label-free quantification (LFQ) algorithm. Functional enrichment analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were employed as bioinformatics tools to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the DEPs and disease progression. Significantly reduced blood glucose and HbA1c levels and an increased cross-sectional area (CSA) of gastrocnemius muscle fibers were seen in the ET group after the exercise interventions due to upregulations of metabolic pathways. Using proteomics data analysis, we found a significant decrease in COL1A1, COL4A2, ENG, and LAMA4 protein levels in the ET gastrocnemius, showing a significant improvement in fibrosis recovery, ECM remodeling, and muscle regeneration via the downregulation of the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Upregulated metabolic pathways due to ET-regulated DEPs in the gastrocnemius indicated increased glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, muscle regeneration, and insulin sensitivity, which play a crucial role in muscle regeneration and maintaining blood glucose and lipid levels. No significant changes were observed in the soleus muscle due to the type of exercise and muscle fiber composition. Our research suggests that engaging in six weeks of aerobic exercise may have a positive impact on the recovery of T2DM-induced sarcopenia, which might be a potential candidate for mitigation, prevention, and therapeutic treatment in the future.;;"Taipei Veterans General Hospital; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University";;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2024;14;3;;;;;;;412;10.3390/life14030412;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life14030412;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001193359500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

To circumvent the principal barrier of serum proteomics, our investigation aimed to evaluate whether a study of post-translational modification enriched serum proteins could be valuable for the discovery of biomarkers or metabolic pathways related to type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. Type 2 diabetes was induced from high-fat diet fed Sprague Dawley rats with streptozotocin injection. Once diabetic status was confirmed, serum samples from either fasted healthy or diabetic rats were pooled and profiled by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis or comparative 2D electrophoresis after protein enrichments using immobilized metal ion, concanavalin A, and lentil affinity chromatography, respectively. Differential expressed proteins were identified and the associated networks were established by an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. As a result, induced rats became severe diabetic and accompanied by hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, and glomerular hypertrophy. There were 3 total, 14 phosphorylated and 23 glycosylated protein targets differentially expressed. Proteins could be linked to HNF4A, HNF1A, and NF kappa B transcriptional factors and antigen presentation, humoral immune response, and inflammatory response pathways. Predicted organ toxicity in kidney, heart, and liver matched with our histopathological results. In conclusion, post-translational modification based serum protein enrichment could be a valuable approach to enhance the resolution of serum proteomics without depleting potentially valuable abundant proteins. Our results also indicated the potential association of the hepatic secretome and hepatocyte nuclear factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and its complications.;;"Fu Jen Catholic University; Cheng Hsin General Hospital; National Defense Medical Center; National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; University of Taipei; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine; Taipei Medical University";;;;;;;;;;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 5;2018;13;11;;;;;;;e0206509;10.1371/journal.pone.0206509;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0206509;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000449291400028;View Full Record in Web of Science

Malonyl ginsenosides (MGR) are the main natural ginsenosides in American ginseng. However, whether the malonyl ginsenosides in P. quinquefolius (PQ-MGR) possess antidiabetic effects has not been explored yet. In this study, the antidiabetic effects and the underlying mechanism of PQ-MGR in high-fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ)-induced T2DM mice were investigated. The chemical composition was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Our results showed that 14 malonyl ginsenosides were identified in the PQ-MGR. Among them, the content of m-Rb1 represented about 77.4% of the total malonyl ginsenosides. After a 5-week experiment, the PQ-MGR significantly reduced the fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels and improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Furthermore, Western blot analysis demonstrated that the protein expressions of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-AMPK, p-ACC, PPAR gamma, and GLUT4 in the liver and skeletal muscle were significantly upregulated after PQ-MGR treatment. In contrast, the protein expressions of p-IRS1 and p-JNK were significantly downregulated. Our results revealed that PQ-MGR could ameliorate glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin resistance in T2DM via regulation of the insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphoinositide3-kinase/protein-kinase B (IRS1/PI3K/Akt) and AMP-activated protein kinase/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) pathways. These findings suggest that PQ-MGR may be used as an antidiabetic candidate drug for T2DM treatment.;;"Jilin Agricultural University; University of Chicago; University of Chicago; Jilin Agricultural University";;;;;;;;;;18;23;;;;;;;;;;;DEC 14;2021;6;49;;;;;33652;33664;;10.1021/acsomega.1c04656;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.1c04656;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000757388000037;View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, both weight gain and aging can lead to similar clinical outcomes such as insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis and stroke. Our objective was to examine the changes in protein expression within the subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese patients, matched for BMI, in relation to age. Mature adipocytes were isolated from liposuction samples of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue collected from both young (26.2 +/- 4.3 (mean age +/- SD); n = 7) and old (52.2 +/- 4.7 (mean age +/- SD); n = 7) obese individuals. Total protein extracts were then compared by two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE). Thirty differentially expressed protein spots (ANOVA test, p <= 0.05; fold-change >= 1.8) were detected, of which, 15 were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. These were comprised of a total of thirteen unique protein sequences. Nine proteins were more abundant in the adipocytes isolated from old vs. young individuals. These proteins included prohibitin 1, protein disulphide isomerase A3, beta actin, profilin, aldo-ketoreductase 1 C2, alpha crystallin B and the annexins A1, A5 and A6. Four other proteins were less abundant in the adipocytes from old, obese subjects and these included keratin type 2 cytoskeletal 1, keratin type 2 cytoskeletal 10 and hemoglobins A and B. The differentially abundant proteins were investigated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to reveal their associations with known biological functions. This analysis identified signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 as the central molecule in the connectivity map and the apoptotic pathway as the pathway with the highest score. Differences in the abundances of several proteins were confirmed by immunoblotting: i.e., prohibitin 1, protein disulphide isomerase A3, beta actin, profilin and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 proteins. In conclusion, proteomic analysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue reveals differences in the abundance of proteins in adipocytes isolated from young vs. old individuals. These differentially abundant proteins are involved in the regulation of apoptosis, cellular senescence and inflammatory response. All these are common pathologic events in both obesity and aging.

Here we study the liver proteome differentially expressed in a long-term high-fat and high-sucrose diet (HPHSD)-induced obesity and diabetes mouse model. Changes in mouse liver proteins were identified using iTRAQ, offline 2D LC (SCX and RP) and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. A total of 1639 proteins was quantified during 3-15 weeks of disease progression and a pronounced proteome change was captured by incorporating the statistical analysis and network analysis. This underscores the importance of protein expression profiles involved in different biological processes that correlate well with the disease progression. The functionally important modules with key hub proteins such as Egfr, Pklr, Suclg1, and Pcx (Carbohydrate metabolism), Cyp2e1, Fasn, Acat1, and Hmgcs2 (Lipid metabolism and ketogenesis), and Gpx1, Mgst1, and Sod2 (ROS metabolism) can be linked to a physiological state of obesity and T2D. Multiple proteins involved in glucose catabolism and lipogenesis were down-regulated, whereas proteins involved in lipid peroxidation and oxidative phosphorylation were up-regulated.

Results: mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, improves metabolic status and cardiac function, attenuates oxidative stress, and alters antioxidant and contractile protein expression in type 2 diabetic mice. Conclusion: Rapamycin may provide metabolic and cardiac benefits in diabetic mice. Significance: mTOR inhibition may be an attractive novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes-related complications. Elevated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes, with increased morbidity and mortality, mainly because of cardiovascular complications. Because mTOR inhibition with rapamycin protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury, we hypothesized that rapamycin would prevent cardiac dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We also investigated the possible mechanisms and novel protein targets involved in rapamycin-induced preservation of cardiac function in T2D mice. Adult male leptin receptor null, homozygous db/db, or wild type mice were treated daily for 28 days with vehicle (5% DMSO) or rapamycin (0.25 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Cardiac function was monitored by echocardiography, and protein targets were identified by proteomics analysis. Rapamycin treatment significantly reduced body weight, heart weight, plasma glucose, triglyceride, and insulin levels in db/db mice. Fractional shortening was improved by rapamycin treatment in db/db mice. Oxidative stress as measured by glutathione levels and lipid peroxidation was significantly reduced in rapamycin-treated db/db hearts. Rapamycin blocked the enhanced phosphorylation of mTOR and S6, but not AKT in db/db hearts. Proteomic (by two-dimensional gel and mass spectrometry) and Western blot analyses identified significant changes in several cytoskeletal/contractile proteins (myosin light chain MLY2, myosin heavy chain 6, myosin-binding protein C), glucose metabolism proteins (pyruvate dehydrogenase E1, PYGB, Pgm2), and antioxidant proteins (peroxiredoxin 5, ferritin heavy chain 1) following rapamycin treatment in db/db heart. These results show that chronic rapamycin treatment prevents cardiac dysfunction in T2D mice, possibly through attenuation of oxidative stress and alteration of antioxidants and contractile as well as glucose metabolic protein expression.;;Virginia Commonwealth University;;;;;;;;;;134;141;;;;;;;;;;;FEB 14;2014;289;7;;;;;4145;4160;;10.1074/jbc.M113.521062;http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M113.521062;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000331403800028;View Full Record in Web of Science

Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) is the early DR which is hard to be noticed in early NPDR, showing significant cause of adult blindness in type 2 diabetes patients. Protein biomarkers have been valuable in the diagnosis of disease and the use of multiple biomarkers has been suggested to overcome the low specificity of single ones. For biomarker development, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) has been spotlighted as an alternative method to quantify target proteins with no need for immunoassay. In this study, 54 candidate DR marker proteins from a previous study were verified by MRM in plasma samples from NPDR patients in 3 stages (mild, moderate and severe; 15 cases each) and diabetic patients without retinopathy (15 cases) as a control. Notably, 27 candidate markers distinguished moderate NPDR from type 2 diabetic patients with no diabetic retinopathy, generating AUC values (>0.7). Specifically, 28 candidate proteins underwent changes in expression as type 2 diabetic patients with no diabetic retinopathy progressed to mild and moderate NPDR Further, a combination of 4 markers from these 28 candidates had the improved specificity in distinguishing moderate NPDR from type 2 diabetic patients with no diabetic retinopathy, yielding a merged AUC value of nearly 1.0.

The up-regulation of the low-molecular-mass heat shock protein Hsp27 was confirmed by an alternative fluorescent staining method of two-dimensional gels and immunoblotting. The observed protein alterations in the cellular stress response, distinct metabolic pathways, regulatory mechanisms and the contractile apparatus might be directly or indirectly associated with peripheral resistance to insulin signalling, making these newly identified muscle proteins potential biomarkers of type-2 diabetes.

Then, the diagnostic value of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) was validated by ELISA analysis in the validated cohort.Results: Based on DIA-MS analysis, we found eight unique proteins specific to T2DM patients with CRC. Among these proteins, four proteins showed different expression between the T2DM + CRC and T2DM groups, and PZP exhibited the largest difference. Next, the diagnostic value of serum PZP was validated by ELISA analysis with an AUC of 0.713. Moreover, the combination of PZP, CA199 and CEA exhibited encouraging diagnostic value, and the AUC reached 0.916.Conclusion: Overall, our current research implied that PZP could be regarded as a newfound serum biomarker for CRC medical diagnosis in T2DM patients.;;"Nanjing Medical University; Nanjing Medical University; Nanjing Medical University";;;;;;;;;;3;3;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 30;2021;8;;;;;;;;736272;10.3389/fmolb.2021.736272;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2021.736272;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000729919500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

To address this heterogeneity, investigators of a previous study clustered people with diabetes according to five diabetes subtypes. The aim of the current study is to investigate the etiology of these clusters by comparing their molecular signatures. In three independent cohorts, in total 15,940 individuals were clustered based on five clinical characteristics. In a subset, genetic (N = 12,828), metabolomic (N = 2,945), lipidomic (N = 2,593), and proteomic (N = 1,170) data were obtained in plasma. For each data type, each cluster was compared with the other four clusters as the reference. The insulin-resistant cluster showed the most distinct molecular signature, with higher branched-chain amino acid, diacylglycerol, and triacylglycerol levels and aberrant protein levels in plasma were enriched for proteins in the intracellular PI3K/Akt pathway. The obese cluster showed higher levels of cytokines. The mild diabetes cluster with high HDL showed the most beneficial molecular profile with effects opposite of those seen in the insulin-resistant cluster. This study shows that clustering people with type 2 diabetes can identify underlying molecular mechanisms related to pancreatic islets, liver, and adipose tissue metabolism. This provides novel biological insights into the diverse aetiological processes that would not be evident when type 2 diabetes is viewed as a homogeneous disease.;;"Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Leiden University - Excl LUMC; University of Amsterdam; University of Dundee; Lund University; Steno Diabetes Center; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam; Eli Lilly; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London; Imperial College London; University of Copenhagen; University of Bergen; Lund University; Skane University Hospital; University of Helsinki; University of Lausanne; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

In this study, a potential new biomarker for T2D and mechanisms underlying the hypoglycemic effects of Enteromorpha prolifera oligosaccharide were investigated. Tandem mass tag labeling with LC-MS/MS was used to identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the jejunum of diabetic rats and control rats. Correlations between glycometabolic parameters and DEPs were revealed by a network analysis. The expression levels of target genes in key metabolic pathways were further evaluated to identify candidate biomarkers. Among 6810 total proteins, approximately 88 % were quantified, of which 148 DEPs with a fold change of <0.83 or>1.2 and a corrected p-value of <0.05 were identified. A KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the hypoglycaemic effects of E. prolifera oligosaccharide involved the PI3K/AKT and extracellular matrix receptor interaction signaling pathways. More importantly, Col1a1 was the most significant gene in the extracellular matrix receptor interaction pathway and was linked to hypoglycaemic activity for the first time. Thus, Col1a1 is a novel potential therapeutic target for alleviating T2D.;;"Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; China Agricultural University";;;;;;;;;;23;24;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2021;165;;;;;;;;105436;10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105436;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105436;;MAR 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000643653800033;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this functional adaptive behavior of the pancreatic beta-cell. This study examines the dynamic changes in protein expression and phosphorylation state associated with (pro)insulin production and secretory pathway function mediated by euglycemia to induce beta-cell rest in obese/diabetic db/db islet beta-cells. Unbiased quantitative profiling of the protein expression and phosphorylation events that occur upon beta-cell adaption during the transition from hyperglycemia to euglycemia was assessed in isolated pancreatic islets from obese diabetic db/db and wild-type (WT) mice using quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics together with bioinformatics analysis. Dynamic changes in the expression and phosphorylation of proteins associated with pancreatic beta-cell (pro)insulin production and complementary regulated-secretory pathway regulation were observed in obese diabetic db/db islets in a hyperglycemic environment, relative to WT mouse islets in a normal euglycemic environment, that resolved when isolated db/db islets were exposed to euglycemia for 12 h in vitro. By similarly treating WT islets in parallel, the effects of tissue culture could be mostly eliminated and only those changes associated with resolution by euglycemia were assessed. Among such regulated protein phosphorylation-dependent signaling events were those associated with COPII-coated vesicle-dependent ER exit, ER-to-Golgi trafficking, clathrin-coat disassembly, and a particular association for the luminal Golgi protein kinase, FAM20C, in control of distal secretory pathway trafficking, sorting, and granule biogenesis. Protein expression and especially phosphorylation play key roles in the regulation of (pro)insulin production, correlative secretory pathway trafficking, and the restoration of beta-cell secretory capacity in the adaptive functional beta-cell response to metabolic demand, especially that mediated by glucose.;;"University of Southern Denmark; University of Chicago; AstraZeneca; Medimmune";;;;;;;;;;19;20;;;;;;;;;;;SEP;2019;18;9;;;;;3245;3258;;10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00160;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00160;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000485089100003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Impaired insulin secretion due to islet dysfunction is linked to the pathogenesis underlying both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Over the past 5 years, emerging proteomic technologies have been applied to dissect the signaling pathways that regulate islet functions and gain an understanding of the mechanisms of islet dysfunction relevant to diabetes. Herein, we briefly review some of the recent quantitative proteomic studies involving pancreatic islets geared towards gaining a better understanding of islet biology relevant to metabolic diseases.;;"United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Joslin Diabetes Center, Inc.; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory";;;;;;;;;;11;12;;;;;;;;;;;AUG;2011;8;4;;;;;495;504;;10.1586/EPR.11.39;http://dx.doi.org/10.1586/EPR.11.39;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000294139500013;View Full Record in Web of Science

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays an essential role in energy metabolism, thus it will give us promising treatment targets through elucidating underlying mechanisms of BAT in obesity. In this study, female C57BL/6J mice were fed HFD or normal diet (ND) for 22 weeks. Hyperinsulinemic- euglycemic clamp was performed to evaluate insulin sensitivity, which was independently correlated with obesity. Using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) coupled with 2D LC-MS/MS, we quantitated 3048 proteins in BAT. As compared HFD with ND, we obtained 727 differentially expressed proteins. Functional analysis found that those proteins were mainly assigned to the pathway of mitochondrial function. In this pathway, carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and apoptosis-inducing factor 1 (AIF1) were up-regulated significantly by HFD, and they were confirmed by western blotting. The results indicated that HFD might induce the apoptosis of brown adipocytes via the up-regulated AIF1. Meanwhile, HFD also stimulated fatty acid beta-oxidation and raised compensatory energy consuming through the increases of CPT2 and UCP1, respectively. However, the apoptosis of brown adipocytes might weaken the compensatory energy expenditure, and finally contribute to overweight/obesity. So, preventing the apoptosis of brown adipocytes may be the key target to treat obesity.;;"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College Hospital; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Institute of Materia Medica - CAMS; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College; Institute of Basic Medical Sciences - CAMS; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College";;;;;;;;;;13;14;;;;;;;;;;;MAR 6;2015;10;3;;;;;;;e0119350;10.1371/journal.pone.0119350;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0119350;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000350689400066;View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of the present study was to explore the application of SELDI proteomic patterns in serum for distinguishing between cases of pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy controls. Methods: Sera from 12 healthy controls, 24 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 126 with pancreatic cancer, including 84 with diabetes, and 61 with chronic pancreatitis, 32 of which were diabetics, were analyzed using SELDI-TOF/MS. Spectra (IMAC-30) were clustered and classified using Biomarker Wizard and Biomarker Pattern software. Results: Two decision tree classification algorithms, one with and one without CA 19-9, were constructed. In the absence of CA 19-9, the splitting protein peaks were: m/z 1526, 1211, and 3519; when CA 19-9 was used in the analysis, it replaced the m/z 3519 splitter. The two algorithms performed equally for classifying patients. A classification tree that considered diabetic patients only was constructed; the main splitters were: 1211, CA 19-9, 7903, 3359, 1802. With this algorithm, 100% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 97% with chronic pancreatitis and 77% of patients with pancreatic cancer were correctly classified. SELDITOF/MS features improved the diagnostic accuracy of CA 19-9 (AUC = 0.883 for CA 19-9; AUC = 0.935 for CA 19-9 and SELDI-TOF/MS features combined). Conclusions: SELDI-TOF/MS allows identification of new peptides which, in addition to CA 19-9, enable the correct classification of the vast majority of patients with pancreatic cancer, which can be distinguished from patients with chronic pancreatitis or type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Twenty proteins were differentially expressed in db/db mouse sera in the first experiment and eight proteins were differentially expressed in db/db mouse sera after liraglutide treatment in the second experiment. Soluble epidermal growth factor receptor (sEGFR) was identified as a common factor, and its protein level was significantly affected in both experiments. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed that the relatively low serum sEGFR levels in db/db mice were restored by liraglutide treatment. The serum sEGFR levels were elevated in diabetic mice with impaired insulin secretion and decreased in high-fat diet-fed mice and ob/ob mice. The serum sEGFR levels increased after the administration of a dual inhibitor of IGF-1/insulin receptor or streptozotocin. In humans with normal glucose tolerance or T2DM, the serum sEGFR levels were correlated with the fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, HbA1c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides levels. These findings suggest that sEGFR might be a biomarker for evaluating insulin resistance or a therapeutic target of liraglutide.We conducted serum proteomics using db/db mice, and identified epidermal growth factor receptor as a marker of diabetes.;;"Yokohama City University; Yokohama City University";;;;;;;;;;7;7;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2017;158;12;;;;;4152;4164;;10.1210/en.2017-00339;http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/en.2017-00339;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000417339400005;View Full Record in Web of Science

With changes associated with modern life, increasing attention has been paid to chronic psychological stressors such as work stress. Chronic psychological stress can induce or aggravate diabetes mellitus, and conversely, with the deterioration of T2DM, patients often experience different degrees of depression, anxiety, and other negative emotions. In order to clarify the role of ZiBuPiYin recipe (ZBPYR) in regulating the liver mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteome to improve T2DM with chronic psychological stress, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified among Zucker lean littermates (control group), chronic psychological stress T2DM rats (model group), and ZBPYR administration rats (ZBPYR group) through iTRAQ with LC-MS/MS. Using Mfuzz soft clustering analysis, DEPs were divided into six different clusters. Clusters 1-6 contained 5, 68, 44, 57, 28, and 32 DEPs, respectively. Given that ZBPYR can alleviate T2DM symptoms and affect exploratory behavior during T2DM with chronic psychological stress, we focused on the clusters with opposite expression trends between model:control and ZBPYR:model groups. We screened out the DEPs in clusters 1, 3, and 4, which may be good candidates for the prevention and treatment of T2DM with chronic psychological stress, and further conducted bioinformatics analyses. DEPs were mainly involved in the insulin signaling pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid metabolism, lysosome-related processes, and lipid metabolism. This may indicate the pathogenic basis of T2DM with chronic psychological stress and the potential therapeutic mechanism of ZBPYR. In addition, two key proteins, lysosome-associated protein (Lamp2) and tricarboxylic acid cycle-related protein (Suclg1), may represent novel biomarkers for T2DM with chronic psychological stress and drug targets of ZBPYR. Western blot analyses also showed similar expression patterns of these two proteins in liver MAMs of the model and ZBPYR groups.;;"Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine; Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Dalian University";;;;;;;;;;2;3;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 3;2022;10;;;;;;;;995732;10.3389/fcell.2022.995732;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2022.995732;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000886145100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

We discuss how MS can quantify AMPK subunit levels in tissues from different species. We propose hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX)-MS to investigate molecular mechanisms of AMPK activation and thermoproteomic profiling (TPP) to assess off-target effects of pharmacological AMPK activators/inhibitors.

Methods: Two different groups of adults were studied. Group I consisted of 8 individualswith normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 8 with T2DM, subjected to SKLM mitochondrial proteome analysis by 2D-gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry-based protein identification. Group II included 24 individuals with NGT and 24 with T2DM, whose SKLM biopsies were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Of the 24 subjects with T2DM, 20 were randomized to receive placebo or PIO (15 mg daily) for 6 months. After 6 months of treatment, SKLM biopsy was repeated. Results: Mitochondrial proteomic analysis on Group I revealed that severalmitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative metabolism were differentially expressed between T2DM and NGT groups, with a downregulation of ATP synthase alpha chain (ATP5A), electron transfer flavoprotein alpha-subunit (ETFA), cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIb isoform 1 (CX6B1), pyruvate dehydrogenase protein X component (ODPX), dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLDH), dihydrolipoamide-S-succinyltransferase (DLST), and mitofilin, and an up-regulation of hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (HCDH), 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA-isomerase (D3D2) and delta3,5-delta2,4-dienoyl-CoA-isomerase (ECH1) in T2DM as compared to NGT subjects. By immunoblot analysis on SKLM lysates obtained from Group II we confirmed that, in comparison to NGT subjects, those with T2DM exhibited lower protein levels of ATP5A (-30%, P = 0.006), ETFA (-50%, P = 0.02), CX6B1 (-30%, P = 0.03), key factors for ATP biosynthesis, and of the structural protein mitofilin (-30%, P = 0.01). T2DM was associated with a reduced abundance of the enzymes involved in the Krebs cycle DLST and ODPX (-20%, P <= 0.05) and increased levels of HCDH and ECH1, enzymes implicated in the fatty acid catabolism (+30%, P = 0.05). In subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with PIO for 6months we found a restored SKLM protein abundance of ATP5A, ETFA, CX6B1, and mitofilin. Moreover, protein levels of HCDH and ECH1 were reduced by -10% and - 15% respectively (P = 0.05 for both) after PIO treatment. Conclusion: Type 2 diabetes is associated with reduced levels of mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and an increased abundance of enzymes implicated in fatty acid catabolism in SKLM. PIO treatment is able to improve SKLM mitochondrial proteomic profile in subjects with T2DM. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, quantitative proteomics acquired from a mouse model were first analyzed. At the same time, functional pathway analysis helped identify functional pathways at the protein level. Then, bioinformatics on mRNA sequencing data were conducted between sepsis and normal mouse models. Differential expressional genes with the closest relationship to disease status and development were identified through module correlation analysis. Then, common biomarkers in proteomics and transcriptomics were extracted as target biomarkers. Through analyzing expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), colocalization analysis on Apoa2 and sepsis phenotype was conducted by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). Then, two-sample and drug-target, syndrome Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were all conducted using the Twosample R package. For protein level, protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) of the target biomarker were also included in MR. Animal experiments helped validate these results. As a result, Apoa2 protein or mRNA was identified as a target biomarker for H-2 with a protective, causal relationship with sepsis.

However, characterising epigenetic influences could further inform disease predictions. Here, we leverage epigenome-wide data to study links between the DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of the circulating proteome and incident diseases. Using data from four cohorts, we trained and tested epigenetic scores (EpiScores) for 953 plasma proteins, identifying 109 scores that explained between 1% and 58% of the variance in protein levels after adjusting for known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) genetic effects. By projecting these EpiScores into an independent sample (Generation Scotland; n = 9537) and relating them to incident morbidities over a follow-up of 14 years, we uncovered 137 EpiScore-disease associations. These associations were largely independent of immune cell proportions, common lifestyle and health factors, and biological aging. Notably, we found that our diabetes-associated EpiScores highlighted previous top biomarker associations from proteome-wide assessments of diabetes. These EpiScores for protein levels can therefore be a valuable resource for disease prediction and risk stratification. eLife digest Although our genetic code does not change throughout our lives, our genes can be turned on and off as a result of epigenetics. Epigenetics can track how the environment and even certain behaviors add or remove small chemical markers to the DNA that makes up the genome. The type and location of these markers may affect whether genes are active or silent, this is, whether the protein coded for by that gene is being produced or not. One common epigenetic marker is known as DNA methylation. DNA methylation has been linked to the levels of a range of proteins in our cells and the risk people have of developing chronic diseases. Blood samples can be used to determine the epigenetic markers a person has on their genome and to study the abundance of many proteins. Gadd, Hillary, McCartney, Zaghlool et al. studied the relationships between DNA methylation and the abundance of 953 different proteins in blood samples from individuals in the German KORA cohort and the Scottish Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. They then used machine learning to analyze the relationship between epigenetic markers found in people's blood and the abundance of proteins, obtaining epigenetic scores or 'EpiScores' for each protein. They found 109 proteins for which DNA methylation patterns explained between at least 1% and up to 58% of the variation in protein levels. Integrating the 'EpiScores' with 14 years of medical records for more than 9000 individuals from the Generation Scotland study revealed 137 connections between EpiScores for proteins and a future diagnosis of common adverse health outcomes. These included diabetes, stroke, depression, Alzheimer's dementia, various cancers, and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Age-related chronic diseases are a growing issue worldwide and place pressure on healthcare systems. They also severely reduce quality of life for individuals over many years. This work shows how epigenetic scores based on protein levels in the blood could predict a person's risk of several of these diseases. In the case of type 2 diabetes, the EpiScore results replicated previous research linking protein levels in the blood to future diagnosis of diabetes. Protein EpiScores could therefore allow researchers to identify people with the highest risk of disease, making it possible to intervene early and prevent these people from developing chronic conditions as they age.";;"University of Edinburgh; Qatar Foundation (QF); Weill Cornell Medical College Qatar; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; University of Oxford; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Munich Heart Alliance; German Centre for Cardiovascular Research; Max Planck Society; German Centre for Cardiovascular Research; Max Planck Society; University of Queensland; University of Edinburgh; Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh";;;;;;;;;;43;43;;;;;;;;;;;JAN 13;2022;11;;;;;;;;e71802;"10.7554/eLife.71802; 10.7554/eLife.71802.sa0; 10.7554/eLife.71802.sa1; 10.7554/eLife.71802.sa2";"http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71802; 10.7554/eLife.71802.sa0; 10.7554/eLife.71802.sa1; 10.7554/eLife.71802.sa2";;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000765242000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Its molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. The aim of this study is to identify new suspect proteins involved in pancreatic beta-cell death induction by saturated fatty acids and its inhibition by unsaturated fatty acids. Experimental design Employing 2DE analysis and subsequent western blot confirmation, the differences in membrane/membrane-associated protein expression in human beta-cell line NES2Y are assessed during cell death induction by stearate and its inhibition by oleate. Results Induction of apoptosis by stearate is associated with significantly increased levels of Hsp90 beta, peroxiredoxin-1, and 14-3-3 gamma in the membrane fraction of NES2Y cells and significantly decreased levels of annexin A2, annexin A4, and reticulocalbin-2. All these changes are significantly inhibited by oleate co-application. No expression changes are detected after application of stearate together with oleate. Furthermore, the expression of reticulocalbin-2 is significantly decreased after stearate application also in the whole cell lysate. Conclusions and clinical relevance Several membrane-associated proteins that could be related to pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling initiated by fatty acids in human pancreatic beta-cells are identified. As far as we know, annexin A4, reticulocalbin-2, and 14-3-3 gamma represent novel molecules related to the effect of fatty acids on beta-cell viability.;;"Charles University Prague; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences";;;;;;;;;;6;6;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2019;13;4;;;;;;;1800104;10.1002/prca.201800104;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prca.201800104;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000475990600020;View Full Record in Web of Science

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease leading to irreversible loss of neurons, intellectual abilities, memory and reasoning. The worldwide prevalence of diabetes and AD in elderly population is a major public health concern. Interestingly, both health issues are unraveling the puzzling links. The clinico-pathological relationship between diabetes and AD has been reported at genomic and proteomic levels. The association of virus infection in type 2 diabetes mellitus and AD has been reported in few recent studies, some have shown direct evidence of virus infection in diabetes and AD while other have shown that diabetes increases the risk of developing AD. This review aims to summarize the association of few common viruses like Hepatitis C Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus-1 which affects both these two age-related devastating diseases. We also discuss the pathological links of Influenza virus, Cytomegalovirus, West Nile virus, Enterovirus, Herpes Simplex Virus-2, Hepatitis viruses in diabetes and Influenza virus, Picornavirus and Borna disease virus in AD. Establishing such relationships and defining their common pathogenesis and patho-physiological mechanisms may lead to new concepts and paths for developing novel preventive strategies and pharmacological treatment options for diabetes and AD. This study may aid in future for the identification of a single or a panel of likely blood-based viral biomarkers for early diagnosis of diabetes and AD with high sensitivity and specificity.;;"King Abdulaziz University; King Abdulaziz University; King Abdulaziz University";;;;;;;;;;16;19;;;;;;;;;;;;2014;13;3;;;;;429;439;;10.2174/18715273113126660164;http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/18715273113126660164;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000340836000008;View Full Record in Web of Science

Insulin is not only involved in carbohydrate metabolism, it also regulates protein synthesis. This work describes the expression of proteins in the liver of a diabetic mouse and identifies the metabolic pathways involved. Twenty-week-old diabetic db/db mice were hepatectomized, after which proteins were separated by 2D-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Spots varying in intensity were analyzed using mass spectrometry, and biological function was assigned by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) software. A differential expression of 26 proteins was identified; among these were arginase-1, pyruvate carboxylase, peroxiredoxin-1, regucalcin, and sorbitol dehydrogenase. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that many of these proteins are mitochondrial and participate in metabolic pathways, such as the citrate cycle, the fructose and mannose metabolism, and glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. In addition, these proteins are related to oxidation-reduction reactions and molecular function of vitamin binding and amino acid metabolism. In conclusion, the proteomic profile of the liver of diabetic mouse db/db exhibited mainly alterations in the metabolism of carbohydrates and nitrogen. These differences illustrate the heterogeneity of diabetes in its different stages and under different conditions and highlights the need to improve treatments for this disease.";;"Universidad de Guanajuato; Universidad de Guadalajara; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico";;;;;;;;;;8;8;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2018;8;2;;;;;;;35;10.3390/biom8020035;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biom8020035;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000436489100022;View Full Record in Web of Science

The recent emergence of a worldwide obesity and Type II diabetes epidemic has increased focus upon small molecules that can modulate energy metabolism, insulin sensitivity and fat biology. Interesting preliminary work done on mangiferin (MGF), the predominant constituent of extracts of the mango plant Mangifera indica L., portends potential for this pharmacophore as a novel parent compound for treating metabolic disorders. MGF is comprised of a C-glucosylated xanthone. Owing to the xanthone chemical structure, MGF has a redox active aromatic system and has antioxidant properties. MGF exerts varied and impressive metabolic effects in animals, improving metabolic disorders. For example we have discovered that MGF is a novel activator of the mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, leading to enhancement of carbohydrate utilization in oxidative metabolism, and leading to increased insulin sensitivity in animal models of obesity and insulin resistance. In addition, recent unbiased proteomics studies revealed that MGF upregulates proteins pivotal for mitochondrial bioenergetics and downregulates proteins controlling de novo lipogenesis in liver, helping to explain protective effects of MGF in prevention of liver steatosis. Several chemical studies have achieved synthesis of MGF, suggesting possible synthetic strategies to alter its chemical structure for development of structure-activity relationship (SAR) information. Ultimately, chemical derivatization studies could lead to the eventual development of novel therapeutics based upon the parent pharmacophore structure. Here we provide comprehensive review on chemical features of MGF, synthesis of its derivatives, its pharmacokinetics and biological activities.;;"Montefiore Medical Center; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Yeshiva University";;;;;;;;;;56;61;;;;;;;;;;;;2015;15;7;;;;;582;594;;10.2174/1389557515666150401111410;http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1389557515666150401111410;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000353914400005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Searching the MS data by Proteome Discoverer software (ThermoFisher Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA), protein abundances were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively and compared between these groups. Combining bioinformatics analysis using Gene Ontology (GO), pathway crosstalk analysis using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using STRING, and literature searching, the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of DVD can be comprehensively judged and were further quantified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve methods.

T2DM is a chronic disease with severe long-term consequences, such as dyslipidemia, retinopathy, kidney failure, and cardiovascular diseases. Although studied extensively, several aspects of T2DM remain poorly understood. Liver is the leading organ in the maintenance of metabolic fitness serving as the first relay station for processing dietary information in a direct response to nutritional input and changes in insulin and other endocrine signals. Evidence from several murine models suggests a unique function of the liver in the development of MS and T2DM. Here, we utilised Db/Db mice to understand the impact of T2DM on the proteome of liver cells. Global analysis of the liver proteome using a SILAC approach identified 407 significantly regulated proteins under diabetic conditions out of 8500 identified liver proteins. Furthermore, we mapped 1604 different acetylation sites in liver proteins. After normalization of the protein level, we identified 34 regulated acetyl lysine residues on 21 individual proteins, which were significantly altered in Db/Db compared to wild-type livers. We reason that the dataset provides a versatile resource for functional studies aiming to understand consequences of changes in protein abundances and acetylation in livers of diabetic animals.;;Max Planck Society;;;;;;;;;;19;21;;;;;;;;;;;;2015;11;3;;;;;908;922;;10.1039/c4mb00490f;http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4mb00490f;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000349995600024;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the molecular mechanisms behind the SADI-S-induced T2DM improvement are not fully understood.Here,T2DM rats received SADI-S and were sacrificed after 8 weeks; the controls received sham surgery; Liver tissues were collected for transcriptomics and proteomics analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and proteins (DEPs). Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was performed to validate the accuracy of the proteomics results.SADI-S significantly improved glucose metabolism in T2DM rats.A total of 120 genes/proteins(e.g., phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) and pyruvate kinase (Pklr)) exhibited consistent expression trends at both mRNA and protein levels. Among the upregulated genes/proteins involved in glucose metabolic pathways, enrichment was observed in pathways such as the pyruvate metabolic pathway, insulin signaling pathway, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis biological processes, glucagon signaling pathway, and AMPK signaling pathway. Downregulated genes/proteins were enriched in the pyruvate metabolic pathway. The above-mentioned signaling pathways are implicated in glucose metabolism, suggesting a potential mechanism for SADI-S-mediated alleviation of T2DM. The PRM validation results indicated that all selected proteins showed consistent trends between PRM and proteomics data. This consistency suggests the reliability of the proteomics results.";;"Zunyi Medical University; Jilin University";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 5;2024;23;12;;;;;5380;5394;;10.1021/acs.jproteome.4c00532;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.4c00532;;NOV 2024;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001348115100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there are no ideal biomarkers for the surveillance and early detection of HCC in the T2DM population at present. In this study, we aimed to explore novel metabolite biomarkers for T2DM-positive [T2DM(+)] HCC by metabolomic analysis. At first, many serum metabolites were found dysregulated in T2DM(+) HCC patients in untargeted metabolomic analyses. Targeted metabolite analyses confirmed that serum benzoic acid and citrulline were increased, and creatine was decreased in T2DM(+) HCC compared to the T2DM group. A metabolite classifier including benzoic acid, creatine, and citrulline was identified as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of T2DM(+) HCC, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.93 for discriminating T2DM(+) HCC patients from T2DM patients. In addition, the metabolite classifier detected small-size (AUC = 0.94), early-stage (AUC = 0.94), and AFP-negative (AUC = 0.96) tumors with high sensitivity and specificity. The combination of this metabolite classifier and AFP might be useful in the surveillance and early detection of HCC in the T2DM population.

Methods: Random urine samples obtained from 28 patients with T2DM and 29 healthy individuals were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) after purification using weak cationic-exchange magnetic beads (MB-WCX). Then the generated mass spectra of peptides were analyzed by ClinProTools2.1 bioinformatics software. Subsequently, the amino acid sequences of differently expressed peptides were identified by a nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and a Sequest search found the corresponding protein name. Results: Three differently expressed peptides and their mass to charge ratios (m/z) were found. Compared with healthy controls, the peak areas of the three differently expressed peptides were all reduced in T2DM, and the m/z were 1056.1 (m/z), 1963.5 (m/z), 2123.5 (m/z), respectively. The above-mentioned peptides were further identified as fragments of histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1), bifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), and clusterin precursor protein (CLU). Conclusions: Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1, bifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, and clusterin precursor protein may serve as potential biomarkers distinguishing type 2 diabetes mellitus patients from healthy controls.

Identifying risk factors associated with DR development and progression is crucial for improving treatment efficacy. Although proteomic changes in DR have been extensively studied, the results remain equivocal. Hence, this study aims to summarize and identify potential diagnostic or prognostic markers for DR. In addition, the upstream regulator responsible for protein deregulation of this disease was also validated.MethodsWe systematically analyzed the current literature on proteomic profile changes in DR, followed by pathway analysis identification. To validate the protein level changes, ELISA was performed from serum samples collected from 27 patients with DR and 25 healthy controls.ResultsOur analysis revealed that 1 candidate marker (afamin [AFM]) distinguished non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) from type 2 diabetic patients with no diabetic retinopathy/controls, 65 candidate markers distinguished proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) from NPDR, 1 candidate marker (thyroid receptor-interacting protein 11 [TRIP11]) distinguished PDR from PDR-DME/DME, and 3 candidate markers for therapeutic evaluation of PDR. Our results pinpoint that inflammatory response, which IL-6 mainly modulated, is responsible for the changes of proteomic profiles identified in DR. This was also validated by ELISA analysis, indicating that IL-6 could be potentially useful for diagnosing DR.ConclusionWe report a comprehensive patient-based proteomic approach to identify potential biomarkers for DR diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment evaluation.;;"Kyushu University; Brawijaya University; Universitas Hasanuddin; Universitas Hasanuddin";;;;;;;;;;2;2;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2023;22;1;;;;;801;815;;10.1007/s40200-023-01204-6;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40200-023-01204-6;;MAR 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000949725300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

An unbiased proteomic screen was used to identify targets of palmitate in beta-cell death. The most significantly altered protein in both human islets and MIN6 beta-cells treated with palmitate was carboxypeptidase E (CPE). Palmitate reduced CPE protein levels within 2 h, preceding endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death, by a mechanism involving CPE translocation to Golgi and lysosomal degradation. Palmitate metabolism and Ca2+ flux were also required for CIPE proteolysis and beta-cell death. Chronic palmitate exposure increased the ratio of proinsulin to insulin. CPE null islets had increased apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Reducing CPE by approximate to 30% using shRNA also increased ER stress and apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of CPE partially rescued beta-cells from palmitate-induced ER stress and apoptosis. Thus, carboxypeptidase E degradation contributes to palmitate-induced beta-cell ER stress and apoptosis. CPE is a major link between hyperlipidemia and beta-cell death pathways in diabetes.;;"University of British Columbia; Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL)";;;;;;;;;;121;137;;;;;;;;;;;JUN 17;2008;105;24;;;;;8452;8457;;10.1073/pnas.0711232105;http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0711232105;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000257011200051;View Full Record in Web of Science

To assess in vitro phenotypic changes, M1 and M2 polarised Type 2 diabetic rat (Goto Kakizaki, GK) macrophages were cultured on micro-rough (SLA) or hydrophilic nanostructured SLA (modSLA) titanium. The in vivo effects of the SLA and modSLA surfaces on macrophage phenotype, wound-associated protein expression and bone formation were investigated using a critical-sized calvarial defect model. Compared to healthy macrophages, GK M2 macrophage function was compromised, secreting significantly lower levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The modSLA surface attenuated the pro-inflammatory cellular environment, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and promoting M2 macrophage phenotype differentiation. ModSLA also suppressed gene expression associated with macrophage multinucleation and giant cell formation and stimulated pro-osteogenic genes in co-cultured osteoblasts. In vivo, modSLA enhanced osteogenesis compared to SLA in GK rats. During early healing, proteomic analysis of both surface adherent and wound exudate material showed that modSLA promoted an immunomodulatory pro-reparative environment. The modSLA surface therefore successfully compensated for the compromised M2 macrophage function in Type 2 diabetes by attenuating the pro-inflammatory response and promoting M2 macrophage activity, thus restoring macrophage homeostasis and resulting in a cellular environment favourable for enhanced osseous healing.;;"University of Queensland; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Menzies Health Institute Queensland; Kyung Hee University";;;;;;;;;;58;61;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2021;267;;;;;;;;120464;10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120464;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120464;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000597147600004;View Full Record in Web of Science

While the literature is clear that there is genetic regulation of physical activity with existing gene knockout data suggesting that skeletal muscle mechanisms contribute to the regulation of activity, actual differences in end-protein expression between high-and low-active mice have not been investigated. This study used two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry to evaluate the proteomic differences between high-active (C57L/J) and low-active (C3H/HeJ) mice in the soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL). Furthermore, vivo-morpholinos were used to transiently knockdown candidate proteins to confirm their involvement in physical activity regulation. Proteins with higher expression patterns generally fell into the calcium-regulating and Krebs (TCA) cycle pathways in the high-active mice (e.g., annexin A6, P = 0.0031; calsequestrin 1; P = 0.000025), while the overexpressed proteins in the low-active mice generally fell into cytoskeletal structure-and electron transport chain-related pathways (e.g., ATPase, P = 0.031; NADH dehydrogenase, P = 0.027). Transient knockdown of annexin A6 and calsequestrin 1 protein of high-active mice with vivo-morpholinos resulted in decreased physical activity levels (P = 0.001). These data suggest that high-and low-active mice have unique protein expression patterns and that each pattern contributes to the peripheral capability to be either high-or low-active, suggesting that different specific mechanisms regulate activity leading to the high-or low-activity status of the animal.";;"Baylor College of Medicine; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station";;;;;;;;;;16;22;;;;;;;;;;;APR;2014;116;8;;;;;1057;1067;;10.1152/japplphysiol.00911.2013;http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00911.2013;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000339166800010;View Full Record in Web of Science

The precise PANDER-induced hepatic signaling mechanism is still being elucidated and has been very complex due to the pleiotropic nature of this novel hormone. Our PANDER transgenic (PANTG) mouse displays a selective hepatic insulin resistant (SHIR) phenotype whereby insulin signaling is blunted yet lipogenesis is increased, a phenomena observed in type 2 diabetes. To examine the complex PANDER-induced mechanism of SHIR, we utilized quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis using Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC) to reveal the global hepatic proteome differences within the PANTG under the metabolic states of fasting, fed and insulin-stimulated conditions. Proteomic analysis identified lipid metabolism as one of the top cellular functions differentially altered in all metabolic states. Differentially expressed proteins within the PANTG having a lipid metabolic role included ACC, ACLY, CD36, CYP7A1, FASN and SCD1. Central to the differentially expressed proteins involved in lipid metabolism was the predicted activation of the liver X receptor (LXR) pathway. Western analysis validated the increased hepatic expression of LXR alpha along with LXR-directed targets such as FASN and CYP7A1 within the PANTG liver. Furthermore, recombinant PANDER was capable of inducing LXR promoter activity in-vitro as determined by luciferase reporter assays. Taken together, PANDER strongly impacts hepatic lipid metabolism across metabolic states and may induce a SHIR phenotype via the LXR pathway. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To understand the complexity of these systemic changes and better monitor the health status of people at risk, validated clinical biomarkers are needed. Omics technologies are increasingly applied to measure the interplay of genes, proteins and metabolites in biological systems, which is imperative in understanding molecular mechanisms of disease and selecting the best possible molecular biomarkers for clinical use. Areas covered: This review describes the complex onset of T2DM, the contribution of obesity and adipose tissue inflammation to the T2DM disease mechanism, and the output of current biomarker strategies. A new biomarker approach is described that combines published and new self-generated data to merge multiple -omes (i.e. genome, proteome, metabolome etc.) toward understanding of mechanism of disease on the individual level and design multiparameter biomarker panels that drive significant impacts on personalized healthcare. Expert commentary: We here propose an approach to use cross-omics analyses to contextualize published biomarker data and better understand molecular mechanisms of health and disease.

Recently, researchers have focused on studying the organs and tissues known to be involved in the development of the type 2 phenotype using a proteomic approach. Little work has been reported on plasma of type 2 diabetics in whom the clinical status has been well characterized. In this study, changes in plasma proteins of type 2 diabetics were investigated by proteomic analysis in well-characterized individuals with type 2 diabetes (early and late stage) and control groups (with or without a family history of diabetes). Methods: Samples were analysed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and significantly differentiated proteins were identified by nano-LC-ESI-MS. Results: A total of 12 protein signatures that were differentially displayed with high significance compared with controls were selected. Four of the differentially displayed proteins were identified as haptoglobin alpha2, haptoglobin Hp2(fragment) and transthyretin and Chain A (formerly prealbumin), and all were up-regulated. Thiol-specific antioxidant protein, Chain A, tertiary structures of three amyloidogenic transthretin variants and haptoglobin-related protein precursor were all down-regulated in controls with a family history of diabetes, early and late diabetic patients in comparison with the control.

We aimed to investigate the role of circulating exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) isolated from humans with simple obesity in the regulation of islet beta-cell mass. Between June 2017 and July 2019, 81 subjects with simple obesity and 102 healthy volunteers with normal weight were recruited. ELVs were isolated by ultra-centrifugation. The proliferations of beta-cells and islets were measured by 5-ethynl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU). Protein components in ELVs were identified by Quantitative Proteomic Analysis and verified by Western blot and ELISA. The role of specific exosomal protein was analyzed by gain-of-function approach in ELVs released by 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Circulating ELVs from subjects with simple obesity inhibited beta-cell proliferation in vitro without affecting its apoptosis, secretion, and inflammation. The protein levels of Rictor and Omentin-1 were downregulated in circulating ELVs from subjects with simple obesity and associated with the obesity-linked pathologic conditions. The ELV-carried Omentin-1 and Omentin-1 protein per se were validated to increase beta-cell proliferation and activate Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, Omentin-1 in ELVs was downregulated by insulin. The circulating ELVs may act as a negative regulator for beta-cell mass in nondiabetic obesity through inhibiting beta-cell proliferation. This effect was associated with downregulated Omentin-1 protein in ELVs. This newly identified ELV-carried protein could be a mediator linking insulin resistance to impaired beta-cell proliferation and a new potential target for increasing beta-cell mass in obesity and T2DM.

T2DM results from insulin resistance of the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. In this study, we used proteomic and bioinformatic methodologies to identify novel hepatic membrane proteins that are related to the development of hepatic insulin resistance, steatosis, and T2DM. Using FT-ICR MS, we identified 95 significantly differentially expressed proteins in the membrane fraction of normal and T2DM db/db mouse liver. These proteins are primarily involved in energy metabolism pathways, molecular transport, and cellular signaling, and many of them have not previously been reported in diabetic studies. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that 16 proteins may be related to the regulation of insulin signaling in the liver. In addition, six proteins are associated with energy stress-induced, nine proteins with inflammatory stress-induced, and 14 proteins with endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Moreover, we identified 19 proteins that may regulate hepatic insulin resistance in a c-Jun amino-terminal kinase-dependent manner. In addition, three proteins, 143-3 protein beta (YWHAB), Slc2a4 (GLUT4), and Dlg4 (PSD-95), are discovered by comprehensive bioinformatic analysis, which have correlations with several proteins identified by proteomics approach.

Using reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled to electrospray Ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS), we identified 96 significant differentially expressed proteins (abundance ratio > 1.5, p < 0.05), including 37 and 59 proteins up- and downregulated in PDR vitreous compared with the control, respectively. Biological pathway analysis revealed 44 proteins involved in 56 biological pathways; among them, the most remarkable pathways differentially represented between PDR and normal vitreous were the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, complement and coagulation cascades, gap junction, and phagosome pathways. The differential expressions of angiopoietin-related protein 6, apolipoprotein A-I, estrogen receptor alpha, and tubulin were confirmed by western blot analysis.

This indicates a central role of mesangial cells in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy. Using the proteomic approach, it was earlier elucidated in a rat model that the proteasome subunit-alpha type-6 protein (PSMA6) is suppressed in the renal cortex in nephropathic kidney. However, the underlying mechanism effecting suppression of PSMA6 protein in the renal cortex is not yet known. Twenty diabetic patients were enrolled and the expression level of PSMA6 in them was detected by immunohistochemistry. The protein and mRNA expression levels of PSMA6 in NRK-52E cells under high glucose condition were determined by Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. Dual luciferase assay was used to detect the relationship of PSMA6 and miR-4490. Our results show that PSMA6 protein is down-regulated in patients with diabetic nephropathy compared with healthy control. Using the NRK-52E cell line cultured under high glucose condition as an in vitro model of diabetic nephropathy, we show that loss of PSMA6 protein expression occured independent of changes the in PSMA6 mRNA expression. We next elucidate that PSMA6 mRNA is post-transcriptionally regulated by the microRNA (miRNA)-4490, whose expression is inversely correlated to PSMA6 protein expression. Using reporter assays we show that PSMA6 is a direct target of the miR-4490. Exogenous manipulation of miR-4490 levels modulated expression of PSMA6, indicating that miR-4490 can be tested as a biomarker for nephropathy in diabetic patients.;;"Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Capital Medical University";;;;;;;;;;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 31;2018;38;;5;;;;;;BSR20180815;10.1042/BSR20180815;http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/BSR20180815;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000448897800071;View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, twenty-nine protein glycation sites were quantified after tryptic digestion of plasma samples at the peptide level using tandem mass spectrometry and isotope-labelled peptides as internal standard. The glycation degrees were determined in three groups, i.e., 48 patients with a duration of T2DM exceeding ten years, 48 non-diabetic individuals matched for gender, BMI, and age, and 20 prediabetic men. In long-term controlled diabetic patients, 27 glycated peptides were detected at significantly higher levels, providing moderate diagnostic accuracies (ACCs) from 61 to 79%, allowing a subgrouping of patients in three distinct clusters. Moreover, a feature set of one glycated peptides and six established clinical parameters provided an ACC of 95%. The same number of clusters was identified in prediabetic males (ACC of 95%) using a set of eight glycation sites (mostly from serum albumin). All patients present in one cluster showed progression of prediabetic state or advanced towards diabetes in the following five years. Overall, the studied glycation sites appear to be promising biomarkers for subgrouping prediabetic patients to estimate their risk for the development of T2DM.;;"Leipzig University; Leipzig University; University System of Ohio; Ohio University; Leipzig University";;;;;;;;;;14;14;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2018;11;2;;;;;;;38;10.3390/ph11020038;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ph11020038;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000445152300008;View Full Record in Web of Science

T2DM physiopathology is influenced by complex interrelationships between genetic, metabolic and lifestyle factors (including diet), which differ between populations and geographic regions. In fact, excessive consumptions of high fat/high sugar foods generally increase the risk of developing T2DM, whereas habitual intakes of plant-based healthy diets usually exert a protective effect. Moreover, genomic studies have allowed the characterization of sequence DNA variants across the human genome, some of which may affect gene expression and protein functions relevant for glucose homeostasis. This comprehensive literature review covers the impact of gene-diet interactions on T2DM susceptibility and disease progression, some of which have demonstrated a value as biomarkers of personal responses to certain nutritional interventions. Also, novel genotype-based dietary strategies have been developed for improving T2DM control in comparison to general lifestyle recommendations. Furthermore, progresses in other omics areas (epigenomics, metagenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) are improving current understanding of genetic insights in T2DM clinical outcomes. Although more investigation is still needed, the analysis of the genetic make-up may help to decipher new paradigms in the pathophysiology of T2DM as well as offer further opportunities to personalize the screening, prevention, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of T2DM through precision nutrition.;;"Universidad Autonoma de Baja California; Universidad Autonoma de Baja California";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;FEB 15;2024;15;2;;;;;;;;10.4239/wjd.v15.i2.142;http://dx.doi.org/10.4239/wjd.v15.i2.142;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001184383900008;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the extensive pharmacological characteristics and the underlying mechanism are unknown. This study investigated the mechanisms by which SZ-A ameliorates glucose metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model of T2DM. Diabetic KKAy mice were treated intragastrically with SZ-A once daily for 8 weeks, after which glucose levels, lipid metabolism, gut microbiome, systemic inflammatory factors, luminal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (fecal samples), and ileal proteomic changes were evaluated. The ileum tissues were collected, and the effects of SZ-A on pathological inflammatory damage were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein expression levels of various inflammatory markers, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa B p65, were detected in the ileum tissues. SZ-A improved glucose metabolism with enhanced insulin response and elevated glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) nearly 2.7-fold during the glucose tolerance test in diabetic KKAy mice. Gut microbiota analysis demonstrated that SZ-A administration elevated the abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Verrucomicrobia, reduced the levels of Rikenellaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae; and increased the concentrations of fecal acetic and propionic acids compared to the diabetic model group. Additionally, SZ-A markedly improved ileal inflammatory injury and pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration and improved intestinal mucosal barrier function in diabetic KKAy mice. SZ-A also attenuated the levels of circulating endotoxin, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines in the mice sera. Collectively, SZ-A ameliorated the overall metabolic profile including glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, which may be associated with an improvement in GLP-1 and insulin secretion, at least in part by modulating the gut microbiome and relieving the degree of ileal and systemic inflammation.";;"Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College";;;;;;;;;;35;42;;;;;;;;;;;APR 15;2021;12;;;;;;;;642400;10.3389/fphar.2021.642400;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.642400;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000645120900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

A data driven cluster analysis in European individuals with T2D previously identified four subtypes: severe insulin deficient (SIDD), severe insulin resistant (SIRD), mild obesity-related (MOD), and mild age-related (MARD) diabetes. Here, the clustering approach was applied to individuals with T2D from the Qatar Biobank and validated in an independent set. Cluster-specific signatures of circulating metabolites and proteins were established, revealing subtype-specific molecular mechanisms, including activation of the complement system with features of autoimmune diabetes and reduced 1,5-anhydroglucitol in SIDD, impaired insulin signaling in SIRD, and elevated leptin and fatty acid binding protein levels in MOD. The MARD cluster was the healthiest with metabolomic and proteomic profiles most similar to the controls. We have translated the T2D subtypes to an Arab population and identified distinct molecular signatures to further our understanding of the etiology of these subtypes. Four T2D subtypes were previously identified: severe insulin deficient, severe insulin resistant, mild obesity-related, and mild age-related diabetes. Here, the authors show that these subtypes can be translated to an Arabic population and identify distinct subtype-specific metabolic and proteomic signatures.;;"Qatar Foundation (QF); Weill Cornell Medical College Qatar; University of Iceland; Novartis; Novartis USA; Lund University; Qatar Foundation (QF); Weill Cornell Medical College Qatar; Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar; University of Edinburgh; Hamad Medical Corporation";;;;;;;;;;29;30;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 19;2022;13;1;;;;;;;7121;10.1038/s41467-022-34754-z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34754-z;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000886221900027;View Full Record in Web of Science

Identification of a marker protein out of thousands became a feasible task during the proteomics era by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In this study, blood samples were obtained from 80 Bahraini subjects with and without T2DM, a subset was used for proteomic analysis by LC-MS/MS, while all samples were used for ELISA analysis of 3 proteins, TATA-box binding protein-associated factor RNA polymerase-1-C (TAF1C), ceruloplasmin (CERP) and fibronectin (FN). The former 2 proteins were selected from the T2DM-protein-panel identified by LC-MS/MS, and the latter was analyzed for validation of the setting. The main findings of the proteomic analysis are i. Identifications of 62 differentially expressed proteins in T2DM, ii. Upregulation of 71% of the identified proteins. While the ELISA analysis showed that; both TAF1C and FN were significantly increased in T2DM (P0.015 and P0.001, respectively), while CERP was not (P0.088). Logistic regression analysis: i. confirmed the above associations after correction for covariates, ii. Revealed an interaction between age and gender that affect the association of the proteins with T2DM. In conclusion, knowing that TAF1C is a prerequisite in ribosomal biogenesis, our ELISA results are suggestive of increased protein synthesis in T2DM, explaining the observed upregulation of the proteins identified by LC-MSMS.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits induced by T2DM are not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of T2DM on behavior, the proteome profile in the hippocampus, and the potential molecular pathways involved in the development of cognitive dysfunction in T2DM mice. We found that the diabetic mice exhibited cognitive impairment in the novel object location recognition test and the novel object recognition test. The proteomic analysis revealed that various molecular pathways were involved in this context. These included the upregulation of proteins in the protein synthesis and folding pathway (EIF5A, RSP24, and PPIB), endocytosis and cellular trafficking (VPS24, SNX12, and ARP2/3), cannabinoid receptor interacting (CRIP1), ubiquitination (SKP1), and oxidative stress response (NUDT3). Downregulated proteins were related to mitochondria function (ANT1), neuronal development (ELP1), protein glycosylation (RPN2), and endocytosis (VPS4). Our study shows that T2DM mice exhibit neurocognitive impairment, which is linked to the dysregulation of hippocampal proteins involved in various molecular pathways. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of T2DM-related cognitive impairment and may identify molecular targets for drug development to treat T2DM-associated cognitive impairment conditions.;;"Burapha University; Burapha University; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; Burapha University";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;;2024;18;;;;;;;;1,17793E+16;10.1177/11779322241306290;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/11779322241306290;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001379862700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

To identify a potential therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes by comparing the subcutaneous interstitial fluid from type 2 diabetes patients and healthy men. Methods. Proteomics was performed on the interstitial fluid of subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained by microdialysis from 7 type 2 diabetes patients and 8 healthy participants. 851 proteins were detected, of which 36 (including galectin-1) showed significantly altered expression in type 2 diabetes. We also measured galectin-1 expression in: (1) adipocytes isolated from adipose tissue biopsies from these participants; (2) subcutaneous adipose tissue of 24 obese participants before, during and after 16 weeks on a very low calorie diet (VLCD); and (3) adipocytes isolated from 6 healthy young participants after 4 weeks on a diet and lifestyle intervention to promote weight gain. We also determined the effect of galectin-1 on glucose uptake in human adipose tissue. Results. Galectin-1 protein levels were elevated in subcutaneous dialysates from type 2 diabetes compared with healthy controls (p < 0.05). In agreement, galectin-1 mRNA expression was increased in adipocytes from the type 2 diabetes patients (p < 0.05). Furthermore, galectin-1 mRNA expression was decreased in adipose tissue after VLCD (p < 0.05) and increased by overfeeding (p < 0.05). Co-incubation of isolated human adipocytes with galectin-1 reduced glucose uptake (p < 0.05) but this was independent of the insulin signal. Conclusion. Proteomics of the interstitial fluid in subcutaneous adipose tissue in vivo identified a novel adipokine, galectin-1, with a potential role in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.

In adipocytes isolated from similar to 0.5 g of subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue of three healthy, lean subjects, we identified a total of 1493 proteins. Triplicate analysis indicated a 22.5% coefficient of variation of protein abundances. Proteins ranged from 5.8 to 629 kDa and included a large number of proteins involved in lipid metabolism, such as fatty acid transport, fatty acid oxidation, lipid storage, lipolysis, and lipid droplet maintenance. Furthermore, we found most glycolysis enzymes and numerous proteins associated with oxidative stress, protein synthesis and degradation as well as some adipokines. 22% of all proteins were of mitochondrial origin.

Dietary flavonoids have been recommended to prevent brain damage. Astragalus membranaceus is a herbal medicine commonly used to relieve the complications of diabetes. Flavonoids is one of the major ingredients of Astragalus membranaceus, but its function and mechanism on diabetic encepholopathy is still unknown. Methods Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model was induced by high fat diet and STZ in C57BL/6J mice, and BEnd.3 and HT22 cell lines were applied in the in vitro study. Quality of flavonoids was evaluated by LC-MS/MS. Differential expressed proteins in the hippocampus were evaluated by proteomics; influence of the flavonoids on composition of gut microbiota was analyzed by metagenomics. Mechanism of the flavonoids on diabetic encepholopathy was analyzed by Q-PCR, Western Blot, and multi-immunological methods et al. Results We found that flavonoids from Astragalus membranaceus (TFA) significantly ameliorated brain damage by modulating gut-microbiota-brain axis: TFA oral administration decreased fasting blood glucose and food intake, repaired blood brain barrier, protected hippocampus synaptic function; improved hippocampus mitochondrial biosynthesis and energy metabolism; and enriched the intestinal microbiome in high fat diet/STZ-induced diabetic mice. In the in vitro study, we found TFA increased viability of HT22 cells and preserved gut barrier integrity in CaCO2 monocellular layer, and PGC1 alpha/AMPK pathway participated in this process. Conclusion Our findings demonstrated that flavonoids from Astragalus membranaceus ameliorated brain impairment, and its modulation on gut-brain axis plays a pivotal role.

Specifically, Amadori peptides were enriched from tryptic digests by boronic acid affinity chromatography, separated by reversed-phase chromatography, and analyzed on-line by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Among the 52 Amadori peptides studied here were 20 peptides resembling 19 glycation sites in six human proteins detected at statistically significantly higher levels in T2DM than in the normoglycemic controls. Four positions appeared to be unique for T2DM within the detection limit.

Previously we showed that levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-18 (IL-18), are elevated in post-mortem AD brains. IL-18 can modulate the tau kinases, Cdk5 and GSK3?, as well as A beta-production. IL-18 levels are also increased in AD risk diseases, including type-2 diabetes and obesity. Here, we explored other IL-18 regulated proteins in neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells. Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, incubated with IL-18 for 24, 48, or 72 h, were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Specific altered protein spots were chosen and identified with mass spectrometry (MS) and verified by western immunoblotting (WIB). IL-18 had time-dependent effects on the SH-SY5Y proteome, modulating numerous protein levels/modifications. We concentrated on those related to OS (DDAH2, peroxiredoxins 2, 3, and 6, DJ-1, BLVRA), A beta-degradation (MMP14, TIMP2), A beta-aggregation (Septin-2), and modifications of axon growth and guidance associated, collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). IL-18 significantly increased antioxidative enzymes, indicative of OS, and altered levels of glycolytic beta- and alpha-enolase and multifunctional 14-3-3 beta and -beta, commonly affected in neurodegenerative diseases. MMP14, TIMP2, alpha-enolase and 14-3-3 beta, indirectly involved in A? metabolism, as well as Septin-2 showed changes that increase A? levels. Increased 14-3-3 beta may contribute to GSK3 beta driven tau hyperphosphorylation and CRMP2 Thr514 and Ser522 phosphorylation with the Thr555-site, a target for Rho kinase, showing time-dependent changes. IL-18 also increased caspase-1 levels and vacuolization of the cells. Although our SH-SY5Y cells were not aged, as neurons in AD, our work suggests that heightened or prolonged IL-18 levels can drive protein changes of known relevance to AD pathogenesis.;;"University of Eastern Finland; University of Eastern Finland; University of Helsinki; University of Eastern Finland; Uppsala University; Monash University; University of Eastern Finland; University of Eastern Finland Hospital; Kuopio University Hospital";;;;;;;;;;20;22;;;;;;;;;;;AUG 7;2014;8;;;;;;;;214;10.3389/fncel.2014.00214;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2014.00214;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000339936300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we analyzed the molecular effects of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin-resistance on mice in two metabolic target tissues, the white adipose tissue (WAT) and the liver. Additionally, we analyzed the effects of drug treatment using the specific PPAR? ligand rosiglitazone. We integrated transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome data sets for a combined holistic view of molecular mechanisms in type 2 diabetes. Using network and pathway analyses, we identified hub proteins such as SDHB and SUCLG1 in WAT and deregulation of major metabolic pathways in the insulin-resistant state, including the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and branched chain amino acid metabolism. Rosiglitazone treatment resulted mainly in modulation via PPAR signaling and oxidative phosphorylation in WAT only. Interestingly, in HFD liver, we could observe a decrease of proteins involved in vitamin B metabolism such as PDXDC1 and DHFR and the according metabolites.

Increased sulfide production or sulfide donor compounds may beneficially regulate hepatic metabolism. Disposal of sulfide through the sulfide oxidation pathway (SOP) is critical for maintaining sulfide within a safe physiological range. We show that mice lacking the liver-enriched mitochondrial SOP enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (Tst(-/-) mice) exhibit high circulating sulfide, increased gluconeogenesis, hypertriglyceridemia, and fatty liver. Unexpectedly, hepatic sulfide levels are normal in Tst(-/-) mice because of exaggerated induction of sulfide disposal, with associated suppression of global protein persulfidation and nuclear respiratory factor 2 target protein levels. Hepatic proteomic and persulfidomic profiles converge on gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism, revealing a selective deficit in medium-chain fatty acid oxidation in Tst(-/-) mice. We reveal a critical role of TST in hepatic metabolism that has implications for sulfide donor strategies in the context of metabolic disease.;;"University of Edinburgh; University of Glasgow; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Edinburgh; Pasteur Network; Universite de Lille; Institut Pasteur Lille; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); CHU Lille; University of Edinburgh; Pohang University of Science & Technology (POSTECH); University of Glasgow; Papworth Hospital; St. Anne's University Hospital Brno (FNUSA); St. Anne's University Hospital Brno (FNUSA-ICRC); Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CEA; Newcastle University - UK";;;;;;;;;;13;13;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 9;2021;37;6;;;;;;;109958;10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109958;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109958;;NOV 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000718288200006;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we attempted to list the proteomic biomarkers of PCOS and T2DM that have been published in the literature so far. We identified eight common biomarkers that were differentially expressed in both women with PCOS and T2DM when compared with healthy controls. These include pyruvate kinase M1/M2, apolipoprotein A-I, albumin, peroxiredoxin 2, annexin A2, alpha-1-B-glycoprotein, flotillin-1 and haptoglobin. These biomarkers could help improve our understanding of the links between PCOS and T2DM and could be potentially used to identify subgroups of women with PCOS at increased risk of T2DM. More studies are required to further evaluate the role these biomarkers play in women with PCOS and T2DM.

Research has shown that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, particularly SBC-115076, have a protective effect against various neurodegenerative diseases. However, their role in DACD remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of PCSK9 inhibitors on DACD. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used to establish an animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The rats were randomly divided into three groups: the Control group (Control, healthy rats, n = 8), the Model group (Model, rats with T2DM, n = 8), and the PCSK9 inhibitor-treated group (Treat, T2DM rats treated with PCSK9 inhibitors, n = 8). To assess the spatial learning and memory of the rats in each group, the Morris water maze (MWM) test was conducted. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and Nissl staining procedures were performed to assess the structural characteristics and functional status of the neurons of rats from each group. Transmission electron microscopy was used to examine the morphology and structure of the hippocampal neurons. Determine serum PCSK9 and lipid metabolism indicators in each group of rats. Use qRT-PCR to detect the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1(3, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) a ) in the hippocampal tissues of each group of rats. Western blot was used to detect the expression of PCSK9 and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in the hippocampal tissues of rats. In addition, a 4D label-free quantitative proteomics approach was used to analyse protein expression in rat hippocampal tissues. The expression of selected proteins in hippocampal tissues was verified fi ed by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: The results showed that the PCSK9 inhibitor alleviated cognitive dysfunction in T2DM rats. PCSK9 inhibitors can reduce PCSK9, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in the serum of T2DM rats. Meanwhile, it was found that PCSK9 inhibitors can reduce the expression of PCSK9, IL-1(3, IL-6, and TNF-a a in the hippocampal tissues of T2DM rats, while increasing the expression of LDLR. Thirteen potential target proteins for the action of PCSK9 inhibitors on DACD rats were identified. fi ed. PRM and IHC revealed that PCSK9 inhibitors effectively counteracted the downregulation of transthyretin in DACD rats. Conclusion: This study uncovered the target proteins and specific fi c mechanisms of PCSK9 inhibitors in DACD, providing an experimental basis for the clinical application of PCSK9 inhibitors for the potential treatment of DACD.";;"Kunming Medical University; Kunming Medical University";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;AUG 14;2024;12;;;;;;;;E17676;10.7717/peerj.17676;http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.17676;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001294738500004;View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study was designed to identify genes and proteins in the adipose tissues with altered expression in the spontaneously hypertensive/NIH -corpulent rat, SHR/NDmcr-cp (CP) and to find possible molecular targets associated with the pathogenesis or progression of obesity related to the metabolic syndrome. Methods: We extracted RNAs and proteins from the epididymal adipose tissues in CP, SHR/Lean (Lean), and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats and performed microarray analysis and two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) linked to a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS). Results: The results showed different mRNA and protein expression levels in the adipose tissue: oligo DNA microarray identified 33 genes that were significantly (P < 0.01) up-regulated and 17 genes significantly down-regulated in CP compared with WKY and Lean rats at both 6 and 25 weeks of age. The affected genes-proteins were associated with lipolytic enzymes stimulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling. Further analysis using the 2D-DIGE connected with MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis, the expression of monoglyceride lipase (MGLL) was significantly up-regulated and that of carboxylesterase 3 (CES3) was significantly down-regulated in 6- and 25-week-old CP compared with age-matched control (WKY and Lean rats).

Role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis and prevention of T2D has sparked widespread interest. Vitamin D plays a classical role in Ca++ homeostasis as well as regulates insulin secretion from beta-cells and its action on various target cells. Proteins are the vital components of all cellular processes and their expression alters in response to various external or internal stimuli. Alteration in protein structure, function may contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases including diabetes. Protein expression during the exposure of the cells to different glucose concentrations may alter and can give vital information about the pathogenesis of T2D. Objective: To study the effect of different glucose concentrations and supplementation of vitamin D on proteomic profile of L6 cell lines. Method: L6 skeletal muscle cells were exposed to different Glucose (G) concentrations (0mM, 8mM, 16mM and 25mM) supplemented with Vitamin D (VD) for 48 hours. Total cell protein was extracted and protein profile was studied using SDS-PAGE. Three distinct bands observed in SDSPAGE in samples obtained from cells which were exposed to 8mM (G), 8mM (G) + VD and 16mM (G). The distinct bands were excised, in gel digestion were performed and MALDI-TOF analysis of the samples were done. Results: MALDI-TOF analysis revealed these bands as mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3 MOUSE), Insulin gene enhancer protein 2 (ISL2 MOUSE) and Tubulin polyglutamylase complex1 (TPGS1 MOUSE) respectively. UCP3 protein is primarily expressed in the skeletal muscle cells and is involved in energy homeostasis and modulates insulin sensitivity. ISL2 protein plays an important role in differentiation and maintenance of the tissues. TPGS1 helps in microtubule polymerization might be helping in glucose transport and also play crucial role in the cellular movement, organization of intracellular structure, and intracellular transport. Conclusion: These identified proteins may provide information about disease pathophysiology and can serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention of T2D. Further studies on the changes of protein expression under high glucose concentration and supplementation with vitamin D will lead to better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of T2D.;;Jaypee Institute of Information Technology (JIIT);;;;;;;;;;2;2;;;;;;;;;;;;2018;25;4;;;;;356;361;;10.2174/0929866525666180406142128;http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/0929866525666180406142128;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000435213800005;View Full Record in Web of Science

We employ mass spectrometry-based proteomics to systematically analyze islets from 9 genetic or diet-induced mouse models representing a broad cross-section of metabolic health. Quantifying the islet proteome to a depth of >11,500 proteins, this study represents the most detailed analysis of mouse islet proteins to date. Our data highlight that the majority of islet proteins are expressed in all strains and diets, but more than half of the proteins vary in expression levels, principally due to genetics. Associating these varied protein expression levels on an individual animal basis with individual phenotypic measures reveals islet mitochondrial function as a major positive indicator of metabolic health regardless of strain. This compendium of strain-specific and dietary changes to mouse islet proteomes represents a comprehensive resource for basic and translational islet cell biology.;;"University of Sydney; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Sydney; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Virginia";;;;;;;;;;10;11;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 22;2021;24;10;;;;;;;103099;10.1016/j.isci.2021.103099;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.103099;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000713819900003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Such studies reveal that an increase in the number of abortive fusion events contributes to defective insulin secretion in in vitro models of Type II diabetes.

Aggressive metabolic control and lowering of systemic and/or intraglomerular blood pressure are effective interventions but not without side effects. Thus a better, early identification of patients at risk for incidence or progression to end-stage renal failure by the use of new, validated biomarkers is highly desirable. In the majority of patients, hypertension and hyperglycaemia are pathogenetically important pathways for the progression of renal disease. Nonetheless even aggressive therapy targeting these factors does not eliminate the risk of end-stage renal failure and experimental evidence suggests that many other pathways (e.g. tubulointerstitial hypoxia or inflammation etc.) also contribute. As their individual importance might vary from patient to patient, interventions which interfere are likely not to be therapeutically effective in all subjects. In this situation, an option to preserve the statistical power of clinical trials is to rely on biomarkers that reflect individual pathophysiology. In current clinical practice, albuminuria is the biomarker that has been best evaluated to guide stratified/personalized therapy but there is a clear need to expand our diagnostic abilities.;;"University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Steno Diabetes Center; Medical University Silesia; Semmelweis University; University of Glasgow; Medical University of Innsbruck";;;;;;;;;;8;9;;;;;;;;;;;AUG;2015;30;;;4;;;1;5;;10.1093/ndt/gfv120;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfv120;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000359781800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Two dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) was applied to establish differential protein expression profiles in four groups. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS) was applied to identify mass spectrometry of differential proteins and analyze follow-up bioinformatics. RESULTS: 2D-DIGE maps of serum protein were satisfactory obtained from NDR, NPDR, PDR and normal control groups. Twenty-six different proteins spots were screened(the volume ratio was > 1.5 based on DeCyder software analysis). Twenty-four of them were verified and two of them were not. Fifteen proteins were verified. Most of them were high-abundant proteins in serum. The four relatively low-abundant ones were beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta (2)-GPI), alpha2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG), alpha1-acid glycoprotein (alpha(1)-AGP) and apolipoprotein A-1 (apo A-1). beta (2)-GPI expression was gradually increased in the development of DR but unrelated to the severity of DR. The volume ratio of beta (2)-GPI is 1.54, 2.43, and 2.84 in NDR, NPDR and PDR group respectively compared with normal control group. CONCLUSION: Serum proteomic analysis of 2D-DIGE combined with MALDI-TOF-TOF MS is feasible to be applied in the study of DR. 13 2-GPI probably takes part in the process of DR occurrence and development and it could be a candidate biomarker on DR diagnosis in early phase.;;"Southern Medical University - China; Southern Medical University - China; Wannan Medical College";;;;;;;;;;16;19;;;;;;;;;;;DEC 18;2011;4;6;;;;;616;622;;10.3980/j.issn.2222-3959.2011.06.08;http://dx.doi.org/10.3980/j.issn.2222-3959.2011.06.08;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000298822300008;View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, identifying periphery biomarkers correlated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is of importance for early diagnosis of AD. Here, we performed platelet proteomics in T2DM patients with MCI (T2DM-MCI) and without MCI (T2DM-nMCI). Pearson analysis of the omics data with MMSE (mini-mental state examination), A beta 1-42/A beta 1-40 (beta-amyloid), and rGSK-3 beta(T/S9) (total to Serine-9-phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta) revealed that mitophagy/autophagy-, insulin signaling-, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways-related proteins were most significantly involved. Among them, only the increase of optineurin, an autophagy-related protein, was simultaneously correlated with the reduced MMSE score, and the increased A beta 1-42/A beta 1-40 and rGSK-3 beta(T/S9), and the optineurin alone could discriminate T2DM-MCI from T2DM-nMCI. Combination of the elevated platelet optineurin and rGSK-3 beta(T/S9) enhanced the MCI-discriminating efficiency with AUC of 0.927, specificity of 86.7%, sensitivity of 85.3%, and accuracy of 0.859, which is promising for predicting cognitive decline in T2DM patients.;;"Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Shenzhen Center for Disease Control & Prevention (SZCDC); Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Nantong University";;;;;;;;;;18;22;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2021;20;10;;;;;;;e13469;10.1111/acel.13469;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acel.13469;;SEP 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000696217000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aims to evaluate the role of T2DM in the progression of endometrial hyperplasia. Methods: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal (N) group, endometrial hyperplasia (NH) group, T2DM (T) group, and endometrial hyperplasia with T2DM (TH) group. Proteomics analysis was performed to determine the protein profile of endometrial tissues. Proliferation, migration, and invasion of cells with/without GLANT2-knockdown were assessed. Immunohistochemical staining and ELISA were used to examine the expression of GALNT2 in endometrial tissues and serum of clinical samples. Results: The highest uterus index and endometrial thickness were observed in TH group, with the expression of proliferation marker PCNA increased significantly, indicating that T2DM facilitates the progress of endometrial hyperplasia. Proteomics analysis showed that there were significant differences in protein profiles among groups and differential proteins were mainly enriched in metabolic pathways. Further verification by molecular biology analysis indicated that GALNT2 is the key target for T2DM facilitating endometrial hyperplasia. The expression of GALNT2 was significantly decreased in high glucose environment. T2DM could synergize the proliferative function of GALNT2 aberration by activating EGFR/AKT/ERK pathway. The decreased expressions of GALNT2 in clinical samples were associated with worse subtypes of endometrial hyperplasia. Conclusion: T2DM promoted the progression of endometrial hyperplasia by regulating the GALNT2-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR and enhancing cell proliferation.

(PMI 5011) has been observed to decrease glucose and insulin levels in animal models and enhance cellular signaling in cultured cells. To determine the mechanism of action of PMI-5011, we have measured changes in protein expression in human primary skeletal muscle culture (HSMC) from subjects with Type 2 diabetes. After obtaining skeletal muscle biopsies, HSMCs were initiated, grown to confluence, and exposed to 10 mu g/mL PMI 5011 overnight. Two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis was used to separate proteins, and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was used to identify differentially regulated proteins. Additionally, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to confirm candidate proteins identified. These data demonstrate that a well characterized botanical extract of Artemisia dracunculus L. significantly modulates proteins involved in regulating inflammatory pathways, particularly the NF kappa B complex system.

We applied label-free differential protein expression analysis using multidimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) to explore the proteomic profile of saliva samples collected from selected type 2 diabetic edentulous patients and non-diabetic controls. Ninety-six peptides corresponding to 52 proteins were differentially expressed between the diabetic edentulous patients and controls (p < 0.05). Some diabetes-related inflammatory biomarkers including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and serum amyloid A were detected with levels increased in diabetic samples. Other biomarkers including amylase, palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated protein (PLUNC), and serotransferrin levels were decreased in diabetic samples. In contrast with previous findings, salivary carbonic anhydrase 6 and alpha-2 macroglobulin levels, however, were decreased in this diabetic patient population. Cluster analysis and principle component analysis demonstrated a differential pattern of protein biomarker expression between diabetic and control subjects. Western blot analysis was completed to confirm the relatively lower expression level of two biomarkers, including PLUNC and amylase in the diabetic group compared to control subjects. The presence of salivary biomarkers specific for diabetes in edentulous subjects mimics those in serum, especially those related to inflammatory/lipid metabolism.

We have described the levels of protein biomarkers specific to diabetes mellitus type 2 in the local population of Pakistan using proteomic technology. Type 2 diabetic patients, age and sex-matched normal healthy controls were recruited from Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Plasma proteins were analysed by 2D liquid chromatographic system in which samples were initially fractionated by chromatofocusing and the selected fractions were further analysed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The proteins which showed variation between test and control samples were identified by MALDI-TOF analysis. All the samples belonging to the control and diabetic groups were then analyzed by ELISA and estimated four proteins which were found to vary. Levels of apolipoprotein A-I was found to decrease by -6.4% while apolipoprotein E, leptin and C reactive protein (CRP) were increased by +802, +842 and +872%, respectively, in the diabetic patients as compared to the controls. The discovery of these marker proteins might thus provide an adjunctive method for early detection of risk for this disease. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Method: To identify potential peptide biomarkers for such applications, 406 sera of T2DM patients (n = 206) and healthy controls (n = 200) are analyzed by using MALDI-TOF MS with a cross-sectional case-control design. Result: Six peptides (peaks m/z 1452.9, 1692.8, 1946.0, 2115.1, 2211.0 and 4053.6) are identified as candidate biomarkers for T2DM. A diagnostic model constructed with six peptides is able to discriminate T2DM patients from healthy controls, with an accuracy of 82.20%, sensitivity of 82.50%, and specificity of 77.80% in the validation set. Peptide peaks m/z 1452.9 and 1692.8 are identified as fragments of the complement C3f, while peptide peaks m/z 1946.0, 2115.1, and 2211.0 are identified as the fragments of kininogen 1 isoform 1 precursor.

We previously uncovered a role for the serine hydrolase carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) in mediating intratumoral activation of the prodrug irinotecan, a constituent of FOLFIRINOX. We aimed to further test the predictive value of CES2 for response to irinotecan using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and to elucidate the determinants of CES2 expression and response to FOLFIRINOX treatment among patients with PDAC.METHODSPDXs were engrafted subcutaneously into nude mice and treated for 4 weeks with either saline control or irinotecan. CES2 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) expression in PDAC tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied to assess the association between overall survival and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels in patients who underwent neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX treatment.RESULTSHigh CES2 activity in PDAC PDXs was associated with increased sensitivity to irinotecan. Integrated gene expression, proteomic analyses, and in vitro genetic experiments revealed that nuclear receptor HNF4A, which is upregulated in diabetes, is the upstream transcriptional regulator of CES2 expression. Elevated CES2 protein expression in PDAC tissues was positively associated with a history of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, 4.84; P = .02). High HbA1C levels were associated with longer overall survival in patients who received neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX treatment (P = .04).CONCLUSIONTo our knowledge, we provide, for the first time, evidence that CES2 expression is associated with a history of type 2 diabetes in PDAC and that elevated HbA1C, by predicting tumor CES2 expression, may represent a novel marker for stratifying patients most likely to respond to FOLFIRINOX therapy.";;"University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Kansas; University of Kansas Medical Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center; H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute";;;;;;;;;;10;12;;;;;;;;;;;APR 23;2020;4;;;;;;426;436;;10.1200/PO.19.00330;http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/PO.19.00330;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000615648900003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Insulin resistance affects especially one of the main target organs of this hormone, the skeletal musculature, making impaired glucose metabolism in contractile fibres a major feature of type 2 diabetes. High levels of circulating free fatty acids, an increased intramyocellular lipid content, impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake, diminished mitochondrial functioning and an overall weakened metabolic flexibility are pathobiochemical hallmarks of diabetic skeletal muscles. In order to increase our cellular understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie this complex diabetes-associated skeletal muscle pathology, we initiated herein a mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of skeletal muscle preparations from the non-obese Goto-Kakizaki rat model of type 2 diabetes. Following staining of high-resolution two-dimensional gels with colloidal Coomassie Blue, 929 protein spots were detected, whereby 21 proteins showed a moderate differential expression pattern. Decreased proteins included carbonic anhydrase, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase and enolase. Increased proteins were identified as monoglyceride lipase, adenylate kinase, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, phosphoglucomutase, aldolase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase, small heat shock Hsp27/B1, actin and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. These proteomic findings suggest that the diabetic phenotype is associated with a generally perturbed protein expression pattern, affecting especially glucose, fatty acid, nucleotide and amino acid metabolism, as well as the contractile apparatus, the cellular stress response, the anti-oxidant defense system and detoxification mechanisms. The altered expression levels of distinct skeletal muscle proteins, as documented in this study, might be helpful for the future establishment of a comprehensive biomarker signature of type 2 diabetes. Reliable markers could be used for improving diagnostics, monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic evaluations.;;Maynooth University;;;;;;;;;;35;41;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2010;25;3;;;;;445;458;;10.3892/ijmm_00000364;http://dx.doi.org/10.3892/ijmm_00000364;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000274717200019;View Full Record in Web of Science

There is also evidence that the disease is associated with cancer metastasis. Centrosome amplification can initiate tumorigenesis with metastasis in vivo and increase the invasiveness of cancer cells in vitro. Our previous study reported that type 2 diabetes promotes centrosome amplification via the upregulation and centrosomal translocation of Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), which suggests that centrosome amplification is a candidate biological link between type 2 diabetes and cancer development. In the present study, functional proteomics analysis was used to further investigate the molecular pathways underlying centrosome amplification by targeting ROCK1 binding partners. High glucose, insulin and palmitic acid were used to induce centrosome amplification, and immunofluorescent staining was employed to visualize centrosomal alterations. Combined with immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis was used to identify ROCK1 binding proteins, and protein complex disruption was achieved by siRNA-knockdown. In total, 1,148 ROCK1 binding proteins were identified, among which 106 proteins were exclusively associated with the treated samples, 193 were only associated with the control samples, and 849 were found in both the control and treated samples. Of the proteins with evidence of centrosomal localization, Dynactin subunit 2 (DCTN2) was confirmed to be localized to the centrosomes. Treating the cells with high glucose, insulin and palmitic acid increased the protein levels of ROCK1 and DCTN2, promoted their binding with each other, and triggered centrosome amplification. Disruption of the protein complex by knocking down ROCK1 or DCTN2 expression partially attenuated centrosome amplification, while simultaneous knockdown of both proteins completely inhibited centrosome amplification. These results suggested ROCK1-DCTN2 binding as a signal for the regulation of centrosome homeostasis, which is key for diabetes-associated centrosome amplification, and enriches our knowledge of centrosome biology. Therefore, the ROCK1-DCTN2 complex may serve as a target for inhibiting centrosome amplification both in research or future therapeutic development.;;"Shanxi Medical University; Changzhi Medical College; Jiangsu Normal University";;;;;;;;;;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2021;46;1;;;;;;;151;10.3892/or.2021.8102;http://dx.doi.org/10.3892/or.2021.8102;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000659027600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite the clinical and economic burden of diabetic neuropathy, no effective treatment is available. More preclinical research must be conducted in order to gain further understanding of the aetiology of the disease and elucidate new therapeutic targets. Methods: The proteome of lumbar dorsal root ganglia and sciatic nerve of BKS-db/db mice, which contain a mutation of the leptin receptor and are an established type 2 diabetes model, was characterized for the first time by tandem mass tag labelling and mass spectrometry analysis. Results: Proteomic analysis showed differentially expressed proteins grouped into functional clusters in db/db peripheral nerves compared to control mice, underlining reduced glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolism, higher lipid catabolism, upregulation of muscle-like proteins in DRG and downregulation in SCN, increased cytoskeleton-related proteins, a mild dysregulation of folding chaperones, activation of acute-phase and inflammatory response, and alterations in glutathione metabolism and oxidative stress related proteins. Conclusions: Our data validate previous transcriptomic and metabolomic results and uncover new pathways altered in diabetic neuropathy.

Protein biomarker screening plays an essential role in different diseases. Proteomic methods such as MALDI-TOF based peptide mass fingerprinting, LC-MS/MS based peptide sequencing, and multidimensional liquid phase chromatography (MDLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS) shotgun proteomics are used to identify biomarkers. Methods In this study, we used a MDLC coupled with tandem MS shotgun proteomic method to demonstrate protein quantitation results by comparing human serum samples from T2DM patients with those of healthy subjects. We utilized quantitative techniques, dimethyl labeling, MDLC by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography separated column, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem MS to identify proteins with high potential to be T2DM biomarker candidates. Results Identified candidates included vitamin D-binding protein, apolipoprotein B-100, apolipoprotein A2, apolipoprotein A1, transthyretin, Ig heavy-chain V-III region BRO, antithrombin-3, fibrinogen gamma chains, fibrinogen alpha chains, and alpha-1-antitrypsin. In addition, we also generated relative protein networks using STRING bioinformatic software.

The study of characteristic metabolic alterations of DKD is crucial for a better understanding of pathogenesis to identify new potential biomarkers and drug targets. We hypothesized that metabolic profiling of amino acids, acylcarnitines, and organic acids are useful new biomarkers for the diagnosis of the early stages of DKD Methods: The hypothesis was testing in a case-control study of 232 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 150 healthy controls. Patients were classified according to urinary albumin and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) into 100 with normoalbuminuria and 132 with microalbuminuria group. Eighteen AcylCNs and 17 amino acids were measured in the blood by tandem mass spectrometry while 17 urinary organic acids were quantitatively measured by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. Results: Regression analysis found that dodecanoylcarnitines C12 (effect size 2.03 [95%CI 1.73-2.32]), triglylcarnitine C5:1 (2.01 [1.70-2.30]), and isovalerylcarnitine C5 (1.78 [1.48-2.07]) were stronger predictors of albumin/creatinine ratio than HbA1c (1.50 [1.20-1.78]) and hence they could serve as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of the early stages of DKD. Conclusions: Targeted metabolic profiling offers a new, non-invasive approach for detecting biomarkers for the early diagnosis of DKD suggesting new pathogenetic phases that might be new targets for treatment.;;"Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Menofia University";;;;;;;;;;11;11;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 2;2021;78;4;;;;;184;190;;10.1080/09674845.2021.1894705;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09674845.2021.1894705;;MAY 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000648777100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study investigated the association of sex with the abundance of endogenous urinary peptides, using capillary electrophoresis-coupled to mass spectrometry (CE-MS) datasets from 2008 healthy individuals and patients with type II diabetes, divided in one discovery and two validation cohorts. Statistical analysis using the Mann-Whitney test, adjusted for multiple testing, revealed 143 sex-associated peptides in the discovery cohort. Of these, 90 peptides were associated with sex in at least one of the validation cohorts and showed agreement in their regulation trends across all cohorts. The 90 sex-associated peptides were fragments of 29 parental proteins. Comparison with previously published transcriptomics data demonstrated that the genes encoding 16 of these parental proteins had sex-biased expression. The 143 sex-associated peptides were combined into a support vector machine-based classifier that could discriminate males from females in two independent sets of healthy individuals and patients with type II diabetes, with an AUC of 89% and 81%, respectively. Collectively, the urinary peptidome contains multiple sex-associated differences, which may enable a better understanding of sex-biased molecular mechanisms and the development of more accurate diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive classifiers for each individual sex.;;"Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) Solutions; RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University Hospital; Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University Hospital";;;;;;;;;;2;2;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2024;24;5;;;;;;;;10.1002/pmic.202300227;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pmic.202300227;;SEP 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001070305900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

High glucose reprograms DNA methylation patterns in various cell/tissue types, including ECs, resulting in pathologically relevant changes in cellular and extracellular proteome. However, DNA methylation-based proteome reprogramming in endothelial exosomes and associated pathological implications in T2D are not known. Hence, in the present study, we used Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), High Fat Diet (HFD) induced diabetic mice (C57BL/6) and clinical models to understand epigenetic basis of exosome proteome regulation in T2D pathogenesis . Exosomes were isolated by size exclusion chromatography and subjected to tandem mass tag (TMT) labelled quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics analysis. Immunoblotting was performed to validate exosome protein signature in clinically characterized individuals with T2D. We observed ECs cultured in high glucose and aortic ECs from HFD mouse expressed elevated DNA methyltransferase1 (DNMT1) levels. Quantitative proteomics of exosomes isolated from ECs treated with high glucose and overexpressing DNMT1 showed significant alterations in both protein levels and post translational modifications which were aligned to T2D associated vascular functions. Based on ontology and gene-function-disease interaction analysis, differentially expressed exosome proteins such as Thrombospondin1, Pentraxin3 and Cystatin C related to vascular complications were significantly increased in HUVECs treated with high glucose and HFD animals and T2D individuals with higher levels of glycated hemoglobin. These proteins were reduced upon treatment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has thousand years of history, and syndrome differentiation is the foundation and essence of the TCM theory. As it has distinctive advantages in diagnosing and treating the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the purpose of this research is to distinguish T2DM patients with or without damp-heat syndrome (DHS), as well as to discover biomarkers associated with syndrome employing the metabolomics-proteomics technique. Materials and Methods. The metabolomics-proteomics of sixty patients with T2DM were acquired by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In addition, some clinical features, containing total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) together with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), were determined via clinical detection strategies. Abundant metabolites and proteins, respectively, were identified with the analysis of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results. 22 differentially abundant metabolites and 15 differentially abundant proteins were determined. The analysis of bioinformatics suggested that the differentially abundant proteins were commonly associated with the renin-angiotensin system, vitamin digestion and absorption, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and so on. Furthermore, differentially abundant metabolites were amino acids and were associated with the biosynthesis of CoA and pantothenate, together with the metabolisms of phenylalanine, beta-alanine, proline, and arginine. Combination analysis revealed that the vitamin metabolism pathway was predominantly affected. Conclusions. DHS syndrome can be separated by certain metabolic-proteomic differences, and metabolism is particularly prominent, especially in vitamin digestion and absorption. From the molecular level, we provide preliminary data for the extensive application of TCM in the study of T2DM, and at the same time benefited in a sense diagnosis and treatment of T2DM.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;JUN 2;2023;2023;;;;;;;;5722131;10.1155/2023/5722131;http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2023/5722131;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001003225300002;View Full Record in Web of Science

The mechanism of decreasing blood glucose is believed to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis by increasing muscular glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. Recent studies suggest that metformin may reduce cancer risk; however, its anticancer mechanism in gastric cancers remains unclear. Here, we aim to evaluate the anticancer effects of metformin on human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells. Our results showed that metformin inhibited AGS cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Using small-scale quantitative proteomics, we identified 177 differentially expressed proteins upon metformin treatment; among these, nine proteins such as 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 2 (PSMD2), stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), and adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) were significantly altered. We found that metformin induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, suppressed cell migration, and affected cytoskeleton distribution. Additionally, patients with highly expressed PSMD2, STIP1, and CAP1 have a poor clinical outcome.

Abundant flavonoids are the antidiabetic components of Radix scutellariae, of which baicalin (Baicalein 7-O-glucuronide, BG) is the major bioactive component. Our previous studies found that the water extract of Radix scutellariae (WESB) could exert hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic efficacies by adjusting the ileum FXR-medicated interaction between gut microbiota and bile acid (BA) metabolism. However, it remains unclear whether WESB and its biologically active ingredients exert an antidiabetic effect through bile acid signaling mediated by FXR-CYP7A1. Aims of the study: To explore the mechanism of WESB and its total flavonoids (TF) further and BG on BA signals and glycolipid metabolism in T2DM mice. Materials and methods: The antidiabetic effects of WESB, TF and BG were evaluated by indexing the body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in HFD/STZ-induced (high-fat diet and streptozocin) diabetic mice, and comparing them with the positive control (metformin). The lipids in the mouse liver and the total bile acids (TBA) in the mouse liver and bile were detected by commercial kits. The concentration of BAs in the mouse feces was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The protein expression levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), farnesol X receptor (FXR), etc., in the liver and/or ileum, play a key role in the BAs metabolism of T2DM mice were evaluated by immunoblot analysis. Results: The hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance of T2DM mice were improved after WESB, TF and BG treatment. Especially after BG administration, the levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) and total glyceride (TG) in the T2DM mouse liver were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). While the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) was significant increased (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, the levels of TBA in both the liver and bile of T2DM mice were significantly decreased by BG (p < 0.05). Moreover, the high expression of CYP7A1 in the liver of T2DM mice was significantly inhibited by WESB, TF and BG (p < 0.05), and the high expression of FXR in the ileum of T2DM mice was significantly inhibited by TF (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These results indicated that the hypoglycemic effects of WESB, TF and BG might be exerted by inhibiting the expression of CYP7A1 in T2DM mice, and TF inhibited expression of intestinal FXR by inducing changes in fecal BA profile. BG significantly improved hepatic lipid metabolism. Moreover, BG reduced lipid accumulation in the liver and bile by inhibiting the expression of CYP7A1 in T2DM mice.

To further understand the molecular mechanisms that produce this superior drug efficacy of Abr, a quantitative proteomic approach has been applied to investigate the global protein expression profiles of lung cancer cell A549 treated with Abr and PTX. Only one protein, namely, glucosamine 6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase 1 (GNA1), showed significant differential expression (P< 0.05) in the cutoff of 2.0 fold, suggesting that Abr can be used safely as a substitute for PTX. GNA1 is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine, which is an important donor substrate for N-linked glycosylation and has several important functions such as embryonic development and growth. Albumin plays a major role in the regulation of this protein. In summary, this study first shows that the superior drug effect of Abr is mainly due to the downregulation of GNA1, which causes proliferative delay and cell adhesion defect. It is also noteworthy that the deficiency of GNA1 might reduce insulin secretion which correlates with type 2 diabetes.;;"Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Center for Nanoscience & Technology, CAS";;;;;;;;;;34;36;;;;;;;;;;;;2017;12;;;;;;1685;1697;;10.2147/IJN.S129976;http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S129976;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000395209300002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, insulin has a significant influence on protein metabolism by affecting both the syn-thesis and degradation of proteins in various tissues. To understand the role of progressive hyperglycemia on plasma proteins, in this study, we measured the turnover rates of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated proteins in control (chow diet), predia-betic [a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk] or diabetic [HFD for 8 wk with low-dose streptozotocin (HFD + STZ) in weeks 5-8 of HFD] C57BL/6J mice using heavy water (2H2O)-based metabolic labeling approach. Compared with control mice, HFD and HFD + STZ mice showed elevations of fasting plasma glucose levels in the prediabetic and diabetic range, respectively. Furthermore, the HFD and HFD + STZ mice showed increased hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels, total plasma cholesterol, and plasma TGs. The kinetics of 40 proteins were quantified using the proteome dynamics method, which revealed an increase in the fractional syn-thesis rate (FSR) of HDL-associated proteins in the prediabetic mice compared with control mice, and a decrease in FSR in the diabetic mice. The pathway analysis revealed that proteins with altered turnover rates were involved in acute-phase response, lipid metabolism, and coagulation. In conclusion, prediabetes and diabetes have distinct effects on the turnover rates of HDL proteins. These findings suggest that an early dysregulation of the HDL proteome dynamics can provide mechanistic insights into the changes in protein levels in these conditions.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study is the first to examine the role of gradual hyperglycemia during diabetes disease progression on HDL-associated protein dynamics in the prediabetes and diabetic mice. Our results show that the fractional synthesis rate of HDL-associated proteins increased in the prediabetic mice whereas it decreased in the diabetic mice compared with control mice.

Our proteomic analysis revealed that UCHL1 was the most increased protein in MIN6 cells exposed to palmitate. The present study used a genetic loss-of-function model to test the hypothesis that UCHL1 is required for normal beta cell function and fate under lipotoxic conditions. Human islets, mouse islets and MIN6 cells were used to analyse UCHL1 protein levels and regulation of UCHL1 by palmitate. The levels of free mono-ubiquitin and poly-ubiquitinated proteins were assessed. Gracile axonal dystrophy (GAD) mutant mice lacking UCHL1 were fed a normal or lipotoxic high-fat diet. Glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance and insulin secretion were assessed in vivo. Beta cell death and proliferation were assessed by TUNEL and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining. Insulin secretion, calcium signalling, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, apoptosis and SNARE protein levels were assessed in vitro. UCHL1 protein, which was highly specific to beta cells, was increased by palmitate at basal glucose, but not in the context of hyperglycaemia associated with frank diabetes. Although islet development and function were initially normal in Uchl1 (-/-) mice, a 4-week high-fat diet caused glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion. Uchl1 (-/-) mice had increased ER stress and beta cell apoptosis. The levels of SNARE proteins were dysregulated in Uchl1 (-/-) islets. Palmitate-stimulated vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) ubiquitination was modulated by a chemical UCHL1 inhibitor.

Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the relationship between BDH1 and type 2 diabetes using Mendelian randomization (MR) and to identify novel targets for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes through proteomics. This study primarily employed the Mendelian Randomization (MR) method, leveraging genetic data from numerous large-scale, publicly accessible genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Within this framework, we adopted a two-step, two-sample MR approach to evaluate the relationships between BDH1, plasma proteins, and type 2 diabetes. Finally, we conducted bidirectional MR analyses along with various sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness and reliability of the study findings. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis demonstrated that for each 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in BDH1, the risk of type 2 diabetes decreased by 3% (OR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95, 0.99). Concurrently, the proteomics-based MR analysis identified 37 plasma proteins associated with type 2 diabetes and 27 plasma proteins associated with BDH1. Notably, NBN, ARG1, and CCL11 were found to mediate the protective effect of BDH1 on type 2 diabetes.

Here we performed 2D-DIGE followed by MALDI TOF/TOF analysis to identify proteins that are differentially expressed in liver of pups born to mothers fed vitamin B-12 deficient diet vis-a-vis control diet. To further establish causality, we analyzed the effect of B-12 rehabilitation at parturition on the protein levels and the phenotype in pups. We identified 38 differentially expressed proteins that were enriched in pathways involved in the regulation of amino acid, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Further, three enzymes in the beta-oxidation pathway (hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, medium-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase) were down-regulated in pups born to mothers fed vitamin B-12 deficient diet. We observed age-dependent differential expression of peroxisome proliferator activated-receptor (PPAR) alpha and gamma in the deficient pups. Interestingly, expression of 27 proteins that were differentially expressed was restored to the control levels after rehabilitation of female rats with vitamin B-12 from parturition. Our study thus provides the first evidence that maternal vitamin B-12 deficiency influences lipid and other micronutrient metabolism in pups through regulation of PPAR signaling pathway. Biological significance Maternal vitamin B-12 deficiency has been shown to predict the onset of complex disorders like atherosclerosis, type II diabetes etc. in the next generation during their adulthood. We have shown earlier that pups born to female rats fed with vitamin B-12 deficient diet were obese and developed high levels of other intermediate traits such as triglycerides, cholesterol etc. that are related to the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. In this piece of work using differential proteomic approach we have identified the altered metabolic processes in the liver of vitamin B-12 deficient pups. We have also documented that the proteins involved in beta-oxidation pathway are down-regulated. Further, differential expression of PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma was evidently documented as the master regulator for the alteration of lipid, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism during maternal vitamin B-12 deficiency.

Objective: To investigate the regulation and function of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1) in lipid overload-induced cardiomyocyte death and heart dysfunction. Methods and Results: Mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) developed signs of obesity and type II diabetes mellitus, including hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertension. HFD for 18 weeks also induced heart hypertrophy, fibrosis, myocardial insulin resistance, and cardiomyocyte death. HFD stimulated mitochondrial fission in mouse hearts. Furthermore, HFD increased the protein level, phosphorylation (at the activating serine 616 sites), oligomerization, mitochondrial translocation, and GTPase activity of Drp1 in mouse hearts, indicating that Drp1 was activated. Monkeys fed a diet high in fat and cholesterol for 2.5 years also exhibited myocardial damage and Drp1 activation in the heart. Interestingly, HFD decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized) levels and increased Drp1 acetylation in the heart. In adult cardiomyocytes, palmitate increased Drp1 acetylation, phosphorylation, and protein levels, and these increases were abolished by restoration of the decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized) level. Proteomics analysis and in vitro screening revealed that Drp1 acetylation at lysine 642 (K642) was increased by HFD in mouse hearts and by palmitate incubation in cardiomyocytes. The nonacetylated Drp1 mutation (K642R) attenuated palmitate-induced Drp1 activation, its interaction with voltage-dependent anion channel 1, mitochondrial fission, contractile dysfunction, and cardiomyocyte death. Conclusions: These findings uncover a novel mechanism that contributes to lipid overload-induced heart hypertrophy and dysfunction. Excessive lipid supply created an intracellular environment that facilitated Drp1 acetylation, which, in turn, increased its activity and mitochondrial translocation, resulting in cardiomyocyte dysfunction and death. Thus, Drp1 may be a critical mediator of lipid overload-induced heart dysfunction as well as a potential target for therapy.;;"University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Tongji University; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA); National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA); Thomas Jefferson University";;;;;;;;;;162;171;;;;;;;;;;;FEB 14;2020;126;4;;;;;456;470;;10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315252;http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315252;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000528023200007;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study, comprising two groups of individuals, one on a low-calorie diet (n = 5) and one undergoing bariatric surgery (n = 7), used both targeted and untargeted proteomic approaches to determine changes in protein levels pre- and post-intervention (i.e. 3-6 months later). Changes were observed in both circulating and excreted proteins following weight loss. Targeted multiplexed biochip arrays measured 12 plasma peptides/proteins involved in metabolism and inflammation: C-peptide, ferritin, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 alpha, resistin, insulin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, leptin, plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1, adiponectin, cystatin C, and C-reactive protein. Following a low-calorie diet, plasma insulin and C-reactive protein levels were significantly reduced (P = 0.045 and P = 0.030, respectively); adiponectin increased and leptin decreased following surgery (P = 0.014 and P = 0.005, respectively). Untargeted proteomic analysis employing 2D difference in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE) showed 28 protein spots with >= 1.5-fold changes in expression following weight loss by a low-calorie diet; comparison of pre- and post-intervention urine samples from the bariatric surgery group showed changes in excretion of 110 protein spots. The combination of targeted protein analysis by multiplexed arrays and an exploratory (i.e. an unbiased or discovery) proteomic assessment of hundreds of proteins offers valuable insights into the mechanistic differences between alternative weight-loss strategies. This is a powerful hypothesis-generating approach to study complex, multifactorial syndromes such as obesity. The findings that arise from these studies can then be validated in targeted, hypothesis-directed investigations.";;"King Saud University; King Saud University; King Saud University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Children's Hospital Colorado; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Ain Shams University; King Saud University; Queens University Belfast";;;;;;;;;;15;16;;;;;;;;;;;MAY;2014;239;5;;;;;568;580;;10.1177/1535370214523894;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1535370214523894;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000335511500007;View Full Record in Web of Science

We adopted a proteomics-based approach using 2D-DIGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS to compare the differential plasma proteome between diabetic retinopathy with significant retinopathy occurrence within 5 years after diagnosis of diabetes, and diabetic non-retinopathy without diagnosed retinopathy for more than 10 years after diagnosis of diabetes. We identified 77 plasma proteins, which represent 28 unique gene products. These proteins mainly have inflammatory response and coagulation roles. Our approach identified several potential diabetic retinopathy biomarkers including afamin and the protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5, which may be associated with the progression and development of diabetes. In conclusion, we report a comprehensive patient-based plasma proteomic approach to the identification of potential plasma biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy screening and detection.

We planned to investigate new obesity-related factors using proteomics approaches in a randomly selected three high and three low BMI samples of Epstein-Barr-transformed B (EBV-B) lymphoblastoid cell lines prepared from two groups of young Japanese men with different BMI. To search novel obesity-related factors, comparisons of protein expressions between high and low BMI groups were carried out by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Gene transcripts of proteasome subunits found out from 2-DE were further determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Results from proteomics approach showed that the expression of proteasome a subunit type 5 (PSMA5) was significantly lower in the high BMI male group than in those with low BMI (P < 0.05). To validate these results, we expanded the study to include 20 more men and used real-time PCR to quantify the mRNA expression level in their EBV-B cells. Both PSMA5 and PSMA2 of EBV-B cells showed negative correlation with BMI. Furthermore, the mRNA levels measured in the peripheral blood B lymphocytes for many proteasome subunits in 75 healthy men and women showed significant negative correlation with BMI in healthy men. Our findings suggest that proteasome expression may play a key role in obesity.

In this context, the absence or frequent alterations of the gravity field (i.e. microgravity conditions) might compromise extraterrestrial agriculture and hence space inhabitation by humans. To overcome the deleterious effects of microgravity, a complete understanding of the underlying changes on the macromolecular level is necessary. However, although microgravity-related changes in gene expression are well characterised on the transcriptome level, proteomic data are limited. Moreover, information about the microgravity-induced changes in the seedling proteome during seed germination and the first steps of seedling development is completely missing. One of the valuable tools to assess gravity-related issues is 3D clinorotation (i.e. rotation in two axes). Therefore, here we address the effects of microgravity, simulated by a two-axial clinostat, on the proteome of 24- and 48-h-old seedlings of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). The liquid chromatography-MS-based proteomic analysis and database search revealed 95 up-and 38 downregulated proteins in the tryptic digests obtained from the seedlings subjected to simulated microgravity, with 42 and 52 annotations detected as being unique for 24-and 48-h treatment times, respectively.

Accumulating evidence suggests that an etiologic role for serum microbiota and circulating metabolites in the pathogenesis of T2DM. This study aims to characterize the serum microbiota and circulating metabolites in cynomolgus monkeys with spontaneous T2DM, and provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical T2DM. Methods: We collected serum samples of the 14 cynomolgus monkeys (15-20 years old, male) for serum microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region amplicon sequencing and circulating metabolites analysis by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, of which seven were spontaneous T2DM cynomolgus monkeys and seven were healthy controls. Results: Our results showed that the serum microbiota abundance and diversity were significantly increased in cynomolgus monkeys with spontaneous T2DM compared to healthy controls, the phyla of Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi and the genera of Lactobacillus, rhodobacter and collinsella were also significantly increased. A total of 114 serum differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were identified, of which 22 were selected as potential biomarkers candidates related to spontaneous T2DM in cynomolgus monkeys by multivariate data analysis. In addition, serum levels of total SCFAs, acetate, butyrate, caproate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate were also significantly increased in the present study. The correlation network analyses have selected certain key DEMs, such as D-Psicose, 4-Oxoproline, D-Glutamine, and Hydroxyphenyllactic acid, which may serve as potential biomarkers for distinguishing between T2DM and healthy controls. Conclusion: Our results provide preliminary insights on perturbed serum microbiota and circulating metabolites of cynomolgus monkeys with spontaneous T2DM.

Results: In this work, human serum of non-diabetic and diabetic cohorts was analyzed by proteomic approach. To analyze total 1377 high-confident serum-proteins, we developed a computing strategy called localized statistics of protein abundance distribution (LSPAD) to calculate a significant bias of a particular protein-abundance between these two cohorts. As a result, 68 proteins were found significantly over-represented in the diabetic serum (p < 0.01). In addition, a pathway-associated analysis was developed to obtain the overall pathway bias associated with type 2 diabetes, from which the significant over-representation of complement system associated with type 2 diabetes was uncovered. Moreover, an upstream activator of complement pathway, ficolin-3, was observed over-represented in the serum of type 2 diabetic patients, which was further validated with statistic significance (p=0.012) with more clinical samples. Conclusions: The developed LSPAD approach is well fit for analyzing proteomic data derived from biological complex systems such as plasma proteome. With LSPAD, we disclosed the comprehensive distribution of the proteins associated with diabetes in different abundance levels and the involvement of ficolin-related complement activation in diabetes.;;"Chinese Academy of Sciences; Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, CAS; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS";;;;;;;;;;58;65;;;;;;;;;;;SEP 16;2008;3;9;;;;;;;e3224;10.1371/journal.pone.0003224;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003224;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000264428000007;View Full Record in Web of Science

A non-human primate model such as cynomolgus monkeys can develop T2DM spontaneously in an age-dependent way similar to humans. In this study, a data-independent acquisition-based quantitative proteomics strategy was employed to investigate the serum proteomic profiles of spontaneously diabetic cynomolgus monkeys compared with healthy controls. The results revealed significant differences in protein abundances. A total of 95 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were quantitatively identified in the current study, among which 31 and 64 proteins were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that carbohydrate digestion and absorption was the top enriched pathway by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Protein- protein interaction network analysis demonstrated that MST1 was identified as the most connected protein in the network and could be considered as the hub protein. MST1 was significantly and inversely associated with FSG and HbA1c. Furthermore, recent lines of evidence also indicate that MST1 acts as a crucial regulator in regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis to maintain metabolic homeostasis while simultaneously suppressing the inflammatory processes. In conclusion, our study provides novel insights into serum proteome changes in spontaneously diabetic cynomolgus monkeys and points out that the dysregulation of several DEPs may play an important role in the pathogenesis of T2DM.;;"Hainan University; Hainan University";;;;;;;;;;2;2;;;;;;;;;;;DEC 20;2022;7;50;;;;;46702;46716;;10.1021/acsomega.2c05663;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c05663;;DEC 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000893691700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

It is envisaged that identifying early biomarkers of immune aging would aid in identifying individuals at risk of age-related disease and would allow the discovery of novel intervention strategies. Proteomics has emerged as a rapidly expanding and innovative field, investigating protein expression, interaction and function at a global level. Several proteomic strategies, including use of mass spectrometry and non-mass spectrometry-based detection systems (including secondary antibody labeling with fluorescent tags) may be particularly advantageous in identifying biomarkers of immune health.

In order to identify novel and reliable protein markers for pre-diabetes in humans, healthy volunteers and patients diagnosed with pre-diabetes and stroke were recruited for blood collection. Blood samples were collected from healthy and pre-diabetic subjects 12 h after fasting. BMI was calculated from body weight and height. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (Hb(A1C)), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), insulin and albumin were assayed by automated clinical laboratory methods. We used a quantitative proteomics approach to identify 1074 proteins from the sera of pre-diabetic and healthy subjects. Among them, 500 proteins were then selected using Mascot analysis scores. Further, 70 out of 500 proteins were selected via volcano plot analysis according to their statistical significance and average relative protein ratio. Eventually, 7 serum proteins were singled out as candidate markers for pre-diabetes due to their diabetic relevance and statistical significance. Immunoblotting data demonstrated that laminin subunit alpha 2 (LAMA2), mixed-lineage leukemia 4 (MLL4), and plexin domain containing 2 (PLXDC2) were expressed in pre-diabetic patients but not healthy volunteers. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the combination of the three proteins has greater diagnostic efficacy than any individual protein. Thus, LAMA2, MLL4 and PLXDC2 are novel and reliable serum protein markers for pre-diabetic diagnosis in humans.;;"Academia Sinica - Taiwan; China Medical University Taiwan; Soochow University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Taiwan Ocean University; National Chung Hsing University";;;;;;;;;;11;11;;;;;;;;;;;APR 28;2021;12;;;;;;;;641336;10.3389/fendo.2021.641336;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2021.641336;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000649331300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Our objective in this discovery analysis was to identify genes and proteins regulated by DM to elucidate aberrant cellular metabolic and signaling mediators. We performed label-free proteomics and RNA-sequencing analysis of VAT from female bariatric surgery subjects with DM and without DM (NDM). We quantified 1965 protein groups, 23 proteins, and 372 genes that were differently abundant in DM vs. NDM VAT. Proteins downregulated in DM were related to fatty acid synthesis and mitochondrial function (fatty acid synthase, FASN; dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, mitochondrial, E3 component, DLD; succinate dehydrogenase-alpha, SDHA) while proteins upregulated in DM were associated with innate immunity and transcriptional regulation (vitronectin, VTN; endothelial protein C receptor, EPCR; signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B, STAT5B). Transcriptome indicated defects in innate inflammation, lipid metabolism, and extracellular matrix (ECM) function, and components of complement classical and alternative cascades. The VAT proteome and transcriptome shared 13 biological processes impacted by DM, related to complement activation, cell proliferation and migration, ECM organization, lipid metabolism, and gluconeogenesis. Our data revealed a marked effect of DM in downregulating FASN. We also demonstrate enrichment of complement factor B (CFB), coagulation factor XIII A chain (F13A1), thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), and integrins at mRNA and protein levels, albeit with lower q-values and lack of Western blot or PCR confirmation.

Current diagnosis consists of urine assays of microalbuminuria, which have inadequate specificity and sensitivity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We used proteomic analyses to identify novel biomarkers of nephropathy in urine from type 2 diabetic patients with demonstrated normo-, micro-, or macroalbuminuria. Samples were analyzed by fluorescence two-dimensional (2-D) differential in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE), and protein identification was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS - 2-D DIGE analysis of the urinary proteome in diabetes with nephropathy identified 195 protein spots representing 62 unique proteins. These proteins belonged to several functional groups, i.e., cell development, cell organization, defense response, metabolism, an signal transduction. Comparisons between control and diabetic subjects with different stages of renal dysfunction revealed the differential expression of several proteins. Spot volume quantification identified 7 proteins that were progressively upregulated with increasing albuminuria an 4 proteins that exhibited progressive downregulation. The majority of these potential candidate biomarkers were glycoprotems. CONCLUSIONS - These data demonstrate the ability of proteomic analyses to reveal potential biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy in urine, an important step forward in advancing accurate diagnosis and our understanding of disease mechanisms.;;Oregon Health & Science University;;;;;;;;;;138;162;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2007;30;3;;;;;629;637;;10.2337/dc06-2056;http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc06-2056;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000244941200028;View Full Record in Web of Science

Adipose stem cells (ASCs) showed promising potency in improving type 2 diabetes and its complications through their immunomodulatory and differentiation capabilities. However, the hyperglycaemia of the diabetic microenvironment may exert a detrimental effect on the functionality of ASCs. Herein, we investigate ASC homeostasis and regenerative potential in the diabetic milieu.Methods We conducted data collection and functional enrichment analysis to investigate the differential gene expression profile of MSCs in the diabetic microenvironment. Next, ASCs were cultured in a medium containing diabetic serum (DS) or normal non-diabetic serum (NS) for six days and one-month periods. Proteomic analysis was carried out, and ASCs were then evaluated for apoptosis, changes in the expression of surface markers and DNA repair genes, intracellular oxidative stress, and differentiation capacity. The crosstalk between the ASCs and the diabetic microenvironment was determined by the expression of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines and cytokine receptors.Results The enrichment of MSCs differentially expressed genes in diabetes points to an alteration in oxidative stress regulating pathways in MSCs. Next, proteomic analysis of ASCs in DS revealed differentially expressed proteins that are related to enhanced cellular apoptosis, DNA damage and oxidative stress, altered immunomodulatory and differentiation potential. Our experiments confirmed these data and showed that ASCs cultured in DS suffered apoptosis, intracellular oxidative stress, and defective DNA repair. Under diabetic conditions, ASCs also showed compromised osteogenic, adipogenic, and angiogenic differentiation capacities. Both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression were significantly altered by culture of ASCs in DS denoting defective immunomodulatory potential. Interestingly, ASCs showed induction of antioxidative stress genes and proteins such as SIRT1, TERF1, Clusterin and PKM2.Conclusion We propose that this deterioration in the regenerative function of ASCs is partially mediated by the induced oxidative stress and the diabetic inflammatory milieu. The induction of antioxidative stress factors in ASCs may indicate an adaptation mechanism to the increased oxidative stress in the diabetic microenvironment.;;"Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Zewail City of Science & Technology; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Alexandria University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Ain Shams University; Children's Cancer Hospital 57357; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Suez Canal University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Mansoura University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Zewail City of Science & Technology";;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;JUN 16;2024;16;1;;;;;;;131;10.1186/s13098-024-01365-1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13098-024-01365-1;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001248064400002;View Full Record in Web of Science

We investigated whether circulating levels of preselected proteins were associated with the outcome 'diabetes' and whether these associations were causal. Methods In 2467 individuals of the population-based, cross-sectional EpiHealth study (45-75 years, 50% women), 249 plasma proteins were analysed by the proximity extension assay technique. DNA was genotyped using the Illumina HumanCoreExome-12 v1.0 BeadChip. Diabetes was defined as taking glucose-lowering treatment or having a fasting plasma glucose of >= 7.0 mmol/l. The associations between proteins and diabetes were assessed using logistic regression. To investigate causal relationships between proteins and diabetes, a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomisation was performed based on large, genome-wide association studies belonging to the DIAGRAM and MAGIC consortia, and a genome-wide association study in the EpiHealth study. Results Twenty-six proteins were positively associated with diabetes, including cathepsin D, retinal dehydrogenase 1, alpha-l-iduronidase, hydroxyacid oxidase 1 and galectin-4 (top five findings). Three proteins, lipoprotein lipase, IGF-binding protein 2 and paraoxonase 3 (PON-3), were inversely associated with diabetes. Fourteen of the proteins are novel discoveries. The Mendelian randomisation study did not disclose any significant causal effects between the proteins and diabetes in either direction that were consistent with the relationships found between the protein levels and diabetes. Conclusions/interpretation The 29 proteins associated with diabetes are involved in several physiological pathways, but given the power of the study no causal link was identified for those proteins tested in Mendelian randomisation. Therefore, the identified proteins are likely to be biomarkers for type 2 diabetes, rather than representing causal pathways.;;"Uppsala University; Karolinska Institutet; Dalarna University";;;;;;;;;;30;29;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2019;62;11;;;;;1998;2006;;10.1007/s00125-019-4960-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-019-4960-8;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000491944900005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Materials and MethodsBlood metabolite levels in the amino acid, biogenic amine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine (PC), carnitines, and hexose classes were analyzed in nondiabetic control (n = 27), T2DM without DPNP (n = 58), and T2DM with DPNP (n = 29) using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Variable importance projection (VIP) evaluation by partial least squares discriminant analysis was performed on clinical parameters and metabolites. ResultsSixteen variables with VIP > 1.0 (P < 0.05) were identified across all patient groups, and 5 variables were identified to discriminate between the two T2DM groups. DPNP patients showed elevated fasting blood glucose, glutamate, PC aa C36:1, lysoPC a C18:1, and lysoPC a C18:2, while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, phenylalanine, and tryptophan were reduced. Glutamate, lysoPC a C18:1, and lysoPC a C18:2 discriminated T2DM with DPNP from those without DPNP with an AUC of 0.671. The AUC was improved to 0.765 when ratios of metabolite pairs were considered.

However, the biological intermediates driving this relationship are not fully understood. As novel interventions for treating and managing type 2 diabetes become increasingly available, whether they also disrupt the pathways leading to increased cancer risk is currently unknown. We investigated the effect of a type 2 diabetes intervention, in the form of intentional weight loss, on circulating proteins associated with cancer risk to gain insight into potential mechanisms linking type 2 diabetes and adiposity with cancer development. Methods Fasting serum samples from participants with diabetes enrolled in the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) receiving the Counterweight-Plus weight-loss programme (intervention, N = 117, mean weight-loss 10 kg, 46% diabetes remission) or best-practice care by guidelines (control, N = 143, mean weight-loss 1 kg, 4% diabetes remission) were subject to proteomic analysis using the Olink Oncology-II platform (48% of participants were female; 52% male). To identify proteins which may be altered by the weight-loss intervention, the difference in protein levels between groups at baseline and 1 year was examined using linear regression. Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to extend these results to evaluate cancer risk and elucidate possible biological mechanisms linking type 2 diabetes and cancer development. MR analyses were conducted using independent datasets, including large cancer meta -analyses, UK Biobank, and FinnGen, to estimate potential causal relationships between proteins modified during intentional weight loss and the risk of colorectal, breast, endometrial, gallbladder, liver, and pancreatic cancers. Findings Nine proteins were modified by the intervention: glycoprotein Nmb; furin; Wnt inhibitory factor 1; toll -like receptor 3; pancreatic prohormone; erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2; hepatocyte growth factor; endothelial cell specific molecule 1 and Ret proto-oncogene (Holm corrected P -value <0.05). Mendelian randomization analyses indicated a causal relationship between predicted circulating furin and glycoprotein Nmb on breast cancer risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.67-0.99, P -value = 0.03; and OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.78-0.99, P -value = 0.04 respectively), though these results were not supported in sensitivity analyses examining violations of MR assumptions. Interpretation Intentional weight loss among individuals with recently diagnosed diabetes may modify levels of cancer -related proteins in serum. Further evaluation of the proteins identified in this analysis could reveal molecular pathways that mediate the effect of adiposity and type 2 diabetes on cancer risk.

This is also the first cause of diabetic complications. However, it is now generally accepted that glucotoxicity also participates in the worsening of type 2 diabetes, by affecting the secretion of beta-cells. So far, different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the adverse effects of chronic hyperglycaemia. One of them suggests that the modulation of expression of several key proteins during a hyperglycaemia state, may explain the toxic effect of glucotoxicity. Therefore, proteomic analysis of biological samples represents an interesting method to study the effect of chronic hyperglycaemia on protein expression. The discovery of new proteins for which the expression could be modulated by chronic hyperglycaemia may probably help to better understand the mechanisms underlying glucotoxicity. In this review, we will first present an introduction of the different mechanisms known to be involved in the control of glucose homeostasis and in the development of glucotoxicity. in a second part, some proteomic data linked with the effect of glucotoxicity in pancreas, pancreatic islets and beta-cells will be presented and discussed.

Here, we investigated the plasma concentrations of FFA alone and in combination with protein glycation as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of T2DM. Materials and methods: EDTA-plasma obtained from 48 newly diagnosed male T2DM patients, 48 long-term controlled (24 male and 24 female) T2DM patients, 20 prediabetic male T2DM patients and two age-matched control cohorts (48 non-diabetic (ND) men; 24 male and 24 female ND partipants) were analysed for a set of clinical parameters including FFA. Glycation sites were quantified after tryptic digestion using tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Median plasma concentrations of FFA were almost three-fold higher in samples obtained from newly diagnosed (long-term controlled) T2DM patients than in those obtained from the control group, providing diagnostic sensitivity (SN) of 92% (85%) and specificity (SP) of 90% (88%). When combined with the glycation level of lysine-141 of haptoglobin, diagnostic accuracy improved further for newly diagnosed (SN, 94%; SP 96%) and long-term controlled (SN, 85%; SP, 94%) T2DM patients (HbA1c: SN, 88%; SP, 96%). A prospective pilot study evaluating the prognostic value revealed initially low FFA levels for pre-diabetic patients that increased in the following four years in patients whose prediabetic state worsened or who developed T2DM. Conclusions: FFA levels are elevated in newly diagnosed and long-term controlled T2DM patients, providing high diagnostic accuracy of 87% and 91%, respectively, which improved further when combined with the glycation degree of lysine-141 in haptoglobin. Additionally, FFA showed higher mean fold-changes than HbA1c or FPG in subjects developing T2DM, indicating higher sensitivity towards the progression of the disease.";;"Leipzig University; Leipzig University; Leipzig University";;;;;;;;;;52;58;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2018;20;11;;;;;2661;2669;;10.1111/dom.13449;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/dom.13449;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000446558100017;View Full Record in Web of Science

Exosomes emerge as carriers of biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring. This study aims to identify lipid metabolites in serum exosomes for T2DM diagnosis.Methods Serum samples were collected from newly diagnosed T2DM patients and age and body mass index-matched healthy controls. Exosomes were isolated using exosome isolation reagent, and untargeted/targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to identify and validate altered lipid metabolites. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of candidate lipid metabolites.Results Serum exosomes were successfully isolated from both groups, with untargeted LC-MS/MS revealing distinct lipid metabolite alterations. Notably, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (22:2(13Z,16Z)/14:0) showed stable elevation in T2DM-serum exosomes. Targeted LC-MS/MS confirmed significant increase of PE (22:2(13Z,16Z)/14:0) in T2DM exosomes but not in serum. PE (22:2(13Z,16Z)/14:0) levels not only positively correlated with hemoglobin A1C levels and blood glucose levels, but also effectively distinguished T2DM patients from healthy individuals (area under the curve = 0.9141).Conclusion Our research sheds light on the importance of serum exosome lipid metabolites in diagnosing T2DM, providing valuable insights into the complex lipid metabolism of diabetes.;;;;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;MAY 29;2024;55;6;;;;;724;731;;10.1093/labmed/lmae039;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/labmed/lmae039;;MAY 2024;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001234117700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The study aimed to determine the impact of these DRGs on the biological pathways and networks that are related to the associated disorders and complications in T2DM and to predict its role as prospective biomarkers. Methods: Datasets obtained from metabolomic and proteomic profiling were used for investigation of the differential expression of the genes. A subset of DRGs was integrated into IPA software to explore its biological pathways, related diseases, and their regulation in T2DM. Upon entry into the IPA, only 94 of the DRGs were recognizable, mapped, and matched within the database. Results: The study identified networks that explore the dysregulation of several functions; cell components such as degranulation of cells; molecular transport process and metabolism of cellular proteins; and inflammatory responses. Top disorders associated with DRGs in T2DM are related to organ injuries such as renal damage, connective tissue disorders, and acute inflammatory disorders. Upstream regulator analysis predicted the role of several transcription factors of interest, such as STAT3 and HIF alpha, as well as many kinases such as JAK kinases, which affects the gene expression of the dataset in T2DM. Interleukin 6 (IL6) is the top regulator of the DRGs, followed by leptin (LEP). Monitoring the dysregulation of the coupled expression of the following biomarkers (TNF, IL6, LEP, AGT, APOE, F2, SPP1, and INS) highlights that they could be used as potential prognostic biomarkers. Conclusion: The integration of data obtained by advanced metabolomic and proteomic technologies has made it probable to advantage in understanding the role of these biomarkers in the identification of significant biological processes, pathways, and regulators that are associated with T2DM and its comorbidities.";;"Georgetown University; Qatar University; Qatar University; Hamad Medical Corporation; Hamad Medical Corporation; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Mansoura University";;;;;;;;;;14;14;;;;;;;;;;;;2020;13;;;;;;2409;2431;;10.2147/DMSO.S244432;http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DMSO.S244432;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000548202700003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent evidence links protein carbonylation also to obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), though the protein targets of carbonylation in human plasma have not been identified. In this study, we profiled carbonylated proteins in plasma samples obtained from lean individuals and obese patients with or without T2DM. The plasma samples were digested with trypsin, carbonyl groups were derivatized with O-(biotinylcarbazoylmethyl)hydroxylamine, enriched by avidin affinity chromatography, and analyzed by RPC-MS/MS. Signals of potentially modified peptides were targeted in a second LC-MS/MS analysis to retrieve the peptide sequence and the modified residues. A total of 158 unique carbonylated proteins were identified, of which 52 were detected in plasma samples of all three groups. Interestingly, 36 carbonylated proteins were detected only in obese patients with T2DM, whereas 18 were detected in both nondiabetic groups. The carbonylated proteins originated mostly from liver, plasma, platelet, and endothelium. Functionally, they were mainly involved in cell adhesion, signaling, angiogenesis, and cytoskeletal remodeling. Among the identified carbonylated proteins were several candidates, such as VEGFR-2, MMP-1, argin, MKK4, and compliment C5, already connected before to diabetes, obesity and metabolic diseases.;;"Leipzig University; Leipzig University; Leipzig University";;;;;;;;;;58;64;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2014;13;11;;;;;5081;5093;;10.1021/pr500324y;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr500324y;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000344636500053;View Full Record in Web of Science

Abnormal contents or changes of FAs are associated with a series of diseases. Here we developed a strategy with stable isotope labeling combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (IL-LC-MS) analysis for comprehensive profiling and relative quantitation of LCAs in human serum. In this strategy, a pair of isotope labeling reagents (2-dimethylaminoethylamine (DMED)) and d(4)-2-dimethylaminoethylamine (d(4)-DMED) were employed to selectively label carboxyl groups of LCAs. The DMED and d(4)-DMED labeled products can lose four characteristic neutral fragments of 45 and 49 Da or 63 and 67 Da in collision-induced dissociation. Therefore, quadruple neutral loss scan (QNLS) mode was established and used for non-targeted profiling of LCAs. The peak pairs of DMED and d(4)-DMED labeling with the same retention time, intensity and characteristic mass differences were extracted from the two NLS spectra respectively, and assigned as potential LCA candidates. Using this strategy, 241 LCA candidates were discovered in the human serum; 156 carboxylic acid compounds could be determined by searching HMDB and METLIN databases (FAs are over 90%) and 21 of these LCAs were successfully identified by standards. Subsequently, a modified pseudo-targeted method with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection mode was developed and used for relative quantification of LCAs in human serum from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and healthy controls. As a result, 81 LCAs were found to have significant difference between T2DM patients and healthy controls. Taken together, the isotope labeling combined with tandem mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated to be a powerful strategy for identification and quantification of LCA compounds in serum samples.

Due to its asymptomatic onset, it is often diagnosed after irreversible vascular complications have been initiated. Therefore, specific markers characteristic for very early disease stages and suitable for early diagnostics are required. Glycation of plasma proteins, such as human serum albumin (HSA), has been often suggested as marker. However, the total glycation degree of HSA does not provide sufficient information about short-term fluctuations of blood glucose concentrations due to the large number of glycation sites. Analysis of individual modification sites might be more informative, but methods for reliable quantifications are still missing. Objective: The main objective of this study was to establish and qualify a method of analysis applicable to sensitive and precise quantification of glycations sites in plasma proteins. Methods: Plasma samples obtained from diabetic patients and non-diseased individuals were separated from low-molecular weight compounds, digested with trypsin, enriched for glycated peptides by boronic acid affinity chromatography (BAC), desalted by solid phase extraction (SPE), and separated by RP-HPLC coupled online to ESI-QqQ-MS. Quantification relied on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of multiple glycation sites identified in plasma proteins using a stable isotope dilution approach or internal standardization. Results: The data presented here suggests high selectivity and precision (relative standard deviations below 10%) of the overall approach appearing to be well suited for the identification of prospective biomarkers. Six glycated peptides corresponding to different glycation sites of HSA were present in plasma samples obtained from T2DM patients at significantly higher levels than in non-diabetic men matched for age. Additionally, each of the studied glycation site of HSA appeared to be affected at different degrees. Conclusion: The presented approach enables the sensitive and robust quantification of prospective T2D biomarkers promising for clinical diagnostics.;;"Leipzig University; Leipzig University";;;;;;;;;;30;31;;;;;;;;;;;;2017;24;10;;;;;887;896;;10.2174/0929866524666170202124120;http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/0929866524666170202124120;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000419903500003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. The prevalence of AD and T2DM is increasing at an alarming rate and has become a major public health concern worldwide. The clinico-pathological relationship between AD and T2DM has been debated for more than a decade. Recent epidemiological studies have provided direct evidence that T2DM is a strong risk factor for AD and numerous studies have demonstrated that patients with diabetes have an increased risk of developing AD as compared with healthy individuals. The underlying biological mechanisms that link the development of diabetes with AD are not fully understood and therefore are worth intensive research. The existence of proteomic links between AD and diabetes is an important topic currently under active debate. An understanding of the complex association between diabetes and AD is necessary for the development of novel drug therapies and lifestyle guidelines aimed at the treatment and/or prevention of these diseases. This review aims to summarize what is currently known about the biological and especially proteomic relationships and similarities between these two age-related devastating diseases of modern day life. This study may also aid in future for the identification of a single or a panel of potential blood-based protein biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD and T2DM with high sensitivity and specificity.;;King Abdulaziz University;;;;;;;;;;39;39;;;;;;;;;;;;2014;13;2;;;;;213;225;;10.2174/18715273113126660144;http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/18715273113126660144;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000340835800006;View Full Record in Web of Science

Identifying the risk of CHD in T2DM patients is important for early clinical intervention. Methods: A total of 213 participants, including 81 healthy controls (HCs), 69 T2DM patients and 63 T2DM patients complicated with CHD were recruited in this study. Serum metabolomics were conducted by using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Demographic information and clinical laboratory test results were also collected. Results: Metabolic phenotypes were significantly altered among HC, T2DM and T2DM-CHD. Acylcarnitines were the most disturbed metabolites between T2DM patients and HCs. Lower levels of bile acids and higher levels of fatty acids in serum were closely associated with CHD risk in T2DM patients. Artificial neural network model was constructed for the discrimination of T2DM and T2DM complicated with CHD based on myristic acid, palmitic acid and heptanoylcarnitine, with accuracy larger than 0.95 in both training set and testing set.

Volunteers for the study were patients from the Diabetic Unit, University of Malaya Medical Centre, whose periodontal status was determined. The diabetic volunteers were divided into two groups, i.e., patients with periodontitis and those who were periodontally healthy.

Gel images were scanned using the GS-800 (TM) Calibrated Densitometer. The protein spots were analyzed and expressed in percentage volumes. The percentage volume of each protein spot was subjected to Mann-Whitney statistical analysis using SPSS software and false discovery rate correction. When the expression of the salivary proteins was compared between the T2DM patients with periodontitis with those who were periodontally healthy, seven proteins, including polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, plastin-2, actin related protein 3, leukocyte elastase inhibitor, carbonic anhydrases 6, immunoglobulin J and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, were found to be differentially expressed (p < 0.01304).

The molecular mechanisms underlying the progressive failure of beta-cells to respond to glucose in type-2 diabetes remain unresolved. Using a combination of transcriptomics and proteomics, we find significant dysregulation of major metabolic pathways in islets of diabetic beta V59M mice, a non-obese, eulipidaemic diabetes model. Multiple genes/proteins involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis are upregulated, whereas those involved in oxidative phosphorylation are downregulated. In isolated islets, glucose-induced increases in NADH and ATP are impaired and both oxidative and glycolytic glucose metabolism are reduced. INS-1 beta-cells cultured chronically at high glucose show similar changes in protein expression and reduced glucose-stimulated oxygen consumption: targeted metabolomics reveals impaired metabolism. These data indicate hyperglycaemia induces metabolic changes in beta-cells that markedly reduce mitochondrial metabolism and ATP synthesis. We propose this underlies the progressive failure of beta-cells in diabetes.;;"University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of London; University College London; Francis Crick Institute; University of Oxford; Tokushima University; University of Gothenburg; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Novo Nordisk";;;;;;;;;;227;253;;;;;;;;;;;JUN 6;2019;10;;;;;;;;2474;10.1038/s41467-019-10189-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10189-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000470248100006;View Full Record in Web of Science

SkM has been identified as a secretory tissue, releasing myokines that regulate multiple processes, including vascularization. We sought to determine how myokines secreted from T2D myotubes might influence SkM angiogenesis. Conditioned media (CM) were generated by myotubes from T2D and nondiabetic (ND) subjects. Primary human endothelial cells (HUVEC) and SkM explants were exposed to CM or recombinant myokines, and tube number or capillary outgrowth was determined as well as measurement of protein expression and phosphorylation. CM from ND myotubes stimulated tube formation of HUVEC to a greater extent than T2D myotubes (T2D-CM = 100%, ND-CM = 288 +/- 90% after 48 h, P < 0.05). The effects of T2D myotube CM were mediated by IL-8, not IL-15 or GRO alpha, and were due not to cell damage but rather through regulating tube production and maintenance (response to T2D-IL-8 = 100%, response to ND-IL-8 = 263 +/- 46% after 48 h, P < 0.05). A similar effect was seen in SkM explants with exposure to IL-8. The dose-dependent effect of IL-8 on tube formation was also observable in the PI3K and FAK signaling pathways and mediated at least in part by PI3K, leading to regulation of Tie2 expression. These results suggest that elevated levels of IL-8 secreted from T2D myotubes create a muscle microenvironment that supports reduced capillarization in T2D. Impaired vascularization of SkM limits the availability of substrates, including glucose and contributes to the T2D phenotype.;;"US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA San Diego Healthcare System; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego";;;;;;;;;;34;38;;;;;;;;;;;JUL 1;2015;309;1;;;;;E22;E34;;10.1152/ajpendo.00513.2014;http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00513.2014;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000357514300003;View Full Record in Web of Science

We describe a quantitative proteomics project to measure the T2DM serum proteome response to the Xiaoke Pill and Glibenclamide. Methods: Based on a recently conducted 48-week clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Glibenclamide (n = 400) and Xiaoke Pill (n = 400), after matching for age, sex, BMI, drug dose and whether hypoglycemia occurred, 32 patients were selected for the serum based proteomic analysis and divided into four groups (with/without hypoglycemia treated with Xiaoke Pill or Glibenclamide, n = 8 for each group). We screened the differential serum proteins related to treatments and the onset of hypoglycemia using the iTRAQ labeling quantitative proteomics technique. Baseline and follow-up samples were used. Results: The quantitative proteomics experiments demonstrated that 25 and 21 proteins differed upon treatment with the Xiaoke Pill in patients without and with hypoglycemia, respectively, while 24 and 25 proteins differed upon treatment with Glibenclamide in patients without and with hypoglycemia, respectively. The overlap of different proteins between the patients with and without hypoglycemia given the same drug treatment was much greater than between the patients given different drug treatments. Conclusions: We conclude that the serum proteins response to the two different anti-diabetic drug treatments may serve as a sensitive biomarker for evaluation of the therapeutic effects and continue investigations into the mechanism.;;"Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beijing Institute of Genomics, CAS; QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute; Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI); Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College; Institute of Basic Medical Sciences - CAMS";;;;;;;;;;9;10;;;;;;;;;;;MAY 17;2017;14;;;;;;;;19;10.1186/s12014-017-9154-0;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12014-017-9154-0;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000401770700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

We examined the effects of GDM on the proteome, redox status, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant gene expression in human fetal endothelial cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that proteins involved in redox homeostasis were significantly altered in GDM and associated with increased mitochondrial superoxide generation, protein oxidation, DNA damage, and diminished glutathione (GSH) synthesis. In GDM cells, the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) failed to induce nuclear Nrf2 accumulation and mRNA and/or protein expression of Nrf2 and its target genes NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), Bach1, cystine/glutamate transporter, and glutamate cysteine ligase. Although methylation of CpG islands in Nrf2 or NQO1 promoters was unaltered by GDM, decreased DJ-1 and increased phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 levels may account for impaired Nrf2 signaling. HNE-induced increases in GSH and NQO1 levels were abrogated by Nrf2 small interfering RNA in normal cells, and overexpression of Nrf2 in GDM cells partially restored NQO1 induction. Dysregulation of Nrf2 in fetal endothelium may contribute to the increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in offspring.;;"University of London; University College London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London";;;;;;;;;;105;112;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2013;62;12;;;;;4088;4097;;10.2337/db13-0169;http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db13-0169;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000333738500025;View Full Record in Web of Science

We hypothesized that hypoglycaemia-induced amyloid-related protein changes would be exacerbated in T2D. Materials and methods A prospective, parallel study in T2D (n = 23) and controls (n = 23). Subjects underwent insulin-induced hypoglycaemia with blood sampling at baseline, hypoglycaemia and post-hypoglycaemia; proteomic analysis of amyloid-related proteins was undertaken. Results At baseline, amyloid-precursor protein (APP) (P < .01) was elevated and alpha-synuclein (SNCA) (P < .01) reduced in T2D. At hypoglycaemia, amyloid P-component (P < .01) was elevated and SNCA (P < .05) reduced in T2D; APP (P < .01) and noggin (P < .05) were elevated and SNCA (P < .01) reduced in controls. In the post-hypoglycaemia follow-up period, APP and microtubule-associated protein tau normalized in controls but showed a below-baseline decrease in T2D; noggin normalized in both; SNCA normalized in T2D, with a below-baseline decrease in controls. Conclusion The AD-associated protein pattern found in T2D, with basal elevated APP and reduced SNCA, was exaggerated by hypoglycaemia with increased APP and decreased SNCA. Additional AD-associated protein levels that changed in response to hypoglycaemia, particularly in T2D, included amyloid P-component, microtubule-associated protein tau, apolipoproteins A1 and E3, pappalysin and noggin.

We conducted a small clinical trial to explore the application of metabolomics data in candidate biomarker discovery. Specifically, serum and urine samples from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were profiled on metabolomics platforms before and after 8 weeks of treatment with one of three commonly used oral antidiabetic agents, the sulfonyurea glyburide, the biguanide metformin, or the thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone. Multivariate classification techniques were used to detect serum or urine analytes, obtained at baseline (pre-treatment) that could predict a significant treatment response after 8 weeks. Using this approach, we identified three analytes, measured at baseline, that were associated with response to a thiazolidinedione after 8 weeks of treatment. Although larger and longer-term studies are required to validate any of the candidate biomarkers, pharmacometabolomic profiling, in combination with multivariate classification, is worthy of further exploration as an adjunct to clinical decision making regarding treatment selection and for patient stratification within clinical trials.;;"GlaxoSmithKline; Glaxosmithkline USA; GlaxoSmithKline; Glaxosmithkline USA; GlaxoSmithKline; Glaxosmithkline USA; GlaxoSmithKline; Glaxosmithkline USA; GlaxoSmithKline; Glaxosmithkline USA; GlaxoSmithKline; Glaxosmithkline USA";;;;;;;;;;26;30;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2008;4;4;;;;;337;346;;10.1007/s11306-008-0123-5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11306-008-0123-5;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000260515600005;View Full Record in Web of Science

The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide is known to lower glucose levels and reduce weight. However, the mechanisms underlying the benefits of liraglutide treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remain unclear. Twelve male patients with T2DM (pre and post liraglutide treatment) and HbA1c between 8% and 11% were recruited. In the present study, a two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI TOF) mass spectrometric approach combined with bioinformatics and network pathway analysis was used to explore the urine proteomic profile. The mean age of the patients was 52.4 +/- 7.5 years. After treatment with liraglutide, a statistically significant change (p < 0.006) was observed in HbA1c with no significant changes in body weight or markers of dyslipidemia. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis identified significant changes (>= 1.5-fold change, ANOVA, p <= 0.05) in 32 proteins (4 down- and 28 upregulated) in liraglutide post treatment compared to the pre-treatment state. Albumin, serotransferrin, metallothionein-2 (MT-2), and keratins K1 and K10 were found to be upregulated after liraglutide treatment. The patients showed significant improvement in glycemic control after the 12-week treatment with liraglutide. The renoprotective effect of liraglutide may be linked to the increased urinary abundance of MT-2 and the decreased abundance of zinc alpha 2-glycoprotein (ZAG) and Alpha-1 antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT).

A shotgun proteomics approach was applied to identify proteins differentially expressed between type 2 diabetic (TallyHo) and control (SWR/J) mice in the bladder smooth muscle and urothelium, separately. We were able to identify 1760 nonredundant proteins from the detrusor smooth muscle and 3169 nonredundant proteins from urothelium. Pathway and network analysis of significantly dysregulated proteins was conducted to investigate the molecular processes associated with diabetes. This pinpointed ERK1/2 signaling as a key regulatory node in the diabetes-induced pathophysiology for both tissue types. The detrusor muscle samples showed diabetes-induced increased tissue remodeling-type events such as Actin Cytoskeleton Signaling and Signaling by Rho Family GTPases. The diabetic urothelium samples exhibited oxidative stress responses, as seen in the suppression of protein expression for key players in the NRF2-Mediated Oxidative Stress Response pathway. These results suggest that diabetes induced elevated inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and tissue remodeling are involved in the development of tissue specific diabetic bladder dysfunctions. Validation of signaling dysregulation as a function of diabetes was performed using Western blotting. These data illustrated changes in ERK1/2 phosphorylation as a function of diabetes, with significant decreases in diabetes-associated phosphorylation in urothelium, but the opposite effect in detrusor muscle. These data highlight the importance of understanding tissue specific effects of disease process in understanding pathophysiology in complex disease and pave the way for future studies to better understand important molecular targets in reversing bladder dysfunction.";;"University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University Hospital; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University; Case Western Reserve University Hospital; University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University";;;;;;;;;;17;19;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2015;14;3;;;;;635;645;;10.1074/mcp.M114.041863;http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/mcp.M114.041863;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000350671300016;View Full Record in Web of Science

For instance, proteomics has been used to study the development of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, diabetic complications in tissues like heart, kidney and retina and changes after treatment with anti-diabetic drugs like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors agonists. Together, these studies give a good overview of a number of experimental approaches. Proteomics holds the promise of providing major contributions to the field of diabetes research. However, to achieve this, a number of issues need to be resolved. Appropriate data representation to facilitate data comparison, exchange, and verification is required, as well as improved statistical assessment of proteomic experiments. In addition, it is important to follow up the results with functional studies to be able to make biologically relevant conclusions.

The ProteoMiner equalizing technology was adjusted to the small sample amount, and reproducibility of the identifications was monitored by spike proteins. Based on the label free relative quantification of proteins in depleted plasma of a test set of NZO mice, assays for potential candidates were designed for the setup of a targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM) approach and absolute quantification. We could demonstrate that apolipoprotein E (Apoe), mannose-binding lectin 2 (Mbl2), and parotid secretory protein (Psp) are present at significantly different quantities in depleted plasma of diabetic NZO mice compared to non-diabetic controls using AQUA peptides.

Thus, proteomic approaches to identify DN-related biomarker were performed. Methods: A comparative proteomic approach of 2-D gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry to identify biomarkers in urine samples from 12 DN patients (six type 1 and six type 2 diabetic patients) and six healthy controls. Then, the urinary level of identified protein biomarker was detected by immunoturbidimetry assay in urine samples from 90 type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients with normo-, micro- and macroalbuminuria (n = 30 in each group), and 30 healthy controls. Results: A novel DN-related protein, orosomucoid (alpha 1-acid glycoprotein), was identified by proteomic method. Its abundance was highly upregulated (>eightfold) in DN patients. The data of immunoturbidimetry assay showed urinary orosomucoid excretion rate (UOER) was gradually increased in the normo-, micro- and macroalbuminuria group versus control (0.71 +/- 0.41, 1.93 +/- 0.68, 2.88 +/- 0.94 vs 0.39 +/- 0.28 mu g/min, P < 0.05).

Also, Pearson's correlation analysis indicated UOER was positively correlated with urinary albumin excretion rate, serum creatinine and C-reactive protein (r = 0.830, 0.787 and 0.360, respectively; P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis also showed that increased UOER was an independent risk factor for DN (odds ratio = 3.10, P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Urinary orosomucoid is a DN-related biomarker, which is associated with the development and progression of DN. Furthermore, increased UOER is an independent risk factor of DN.";;"Shandong University; Shandong University of Finance & Economics";;;;;;;;;;42;53;;;;;;;;;;;APR;2009;14;3;;;;;332;337;;10.1111/j.1440-1797.2008.01053.x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1797.2008.01053.x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000265410600011;View Full Record in Web of Science

Proteomics technology offers enormous promise to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying pathologies, however, the analysis of skeletal muscle is challenging. Using state-of-the-art multienzyme digestion and filter-aided sample preparation (MED-FASP) and a mass spectrometry (MS)-based workflow, we performed a global proteomics analysis of skeletal muscle from leptin-deficient, obese, insulin resistant (ob/ob) and lean mice in mere two fractions in a short time (8 h per sample). We identified more than 6000 proteins with 118 proteins differentially regulated in obesity. This included protein kinases, phosphatases, and secreted and fiber type associated proteins. Enzymes involved in lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle from ob/ob mice were increased, providing evidence against reduced fatty acid oxidation in lipid-induced insulin resistance. Mitochondrial and peroxisomal proteins, as well as components of pyruvate and lactate metabolism, were increased. Finally, the skeletal muscle proteome from ob/ob mice displayed a shift toward the slow fiber type. This detailed characterization of an obese rodent model of T2D demonstrates an efficient workflow for skeletal muscle proteomics, which may easily be adapted to other complex tissues.;;"Karolinska Institutet; Novo Nordisk Foundation; University of Copenhagen; Max Planck Society; University of Copenhagen";;;;;;;;;;21;24;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2018;18;5-6;;;SI;;;;1700375;10.1002/pmic.201700375;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pmic.201700375;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000428343700008;View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, a targeted metabolomics for amino acids and acylcarnitines in patients with diabetes and its complications was carried out. Methods: A cohort of 54 normal individuals and 156 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or diabetic complications enrolled from the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinzhou Medical University was studied. The subjects were divided into five main groups: normal individuals, impaired fasting glucose, overt diabetes, diabetic microvascular complications, and diabetic peripheral vascular disease. The technique of tandem mass spectrometry was applied to obtain the plasma metabolite profiles. Metabolomics multivariate statistics were applied for the metabolic data analysis and the differential metabolites determination. Results: A total of 10 cross-comparisons within diabetes and its complications were designed to explore the differential metabolites. The results demonstrated that eight comparisons existed and yielded significant metabolic differences. A total number of 24 differential metabolites were determined from six selected comparisons, including up-regulated amino acids, down-regulated medium-chain and long-chain acylcarnitines. Altered differential metabolites provided six panels of biomarkers, which were helpful in distinguishing diabetic patients. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that the biomarker panels consisted of specific amino acids and acylcarnitines which could reflect the metabolic variations among the different stages of diabetes and might be useful for the differential diagnosis of prediabetes, overt diabetes and diabetic complications.;;"Liaoning University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida";;;;;;;;;;16;16;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2021;45;2;;;;;195;+;;10.4093/dmj.2019.0209;http://dx.doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2019.0209;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000635073800007;View Full Record in Web of Science

The spectrum of miR-126-3p targets and thus the consequences of its dysregulation for adipocyte metabolism are unknown. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to identify novel targets of miR-126-3p in vitro and then establish the outcomes of their dysregulation on adipocyte metabolism in vivo using a well-established maternal obesity mouse model. Methods miR-126-3p overexpression in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes followed by pulsed stable isotope labelling by amino acids in culture (pSILAC) was performed to identify novel targets of the miRNA. Well-established bioinformatics algorithms and luciferase assays were then employed to confirm those that were direct targets of miR-126-3p. Selected knockdown experiments were performed in vitro to define the consequences of target dysregulation. Quantitative real-time PCR, immunoblotting, histology, euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamps and glucose tolerance tests were performed to determine the phenotypic and functional outcomes of maternal programmed miR-126-3p levels in offspring adipose tissue. Results The proteomic approach confirmed the identity of known targets of miR-126-3p (including IRS-1) and identified Lunapark, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein, as a novel one. We confirmed by luciferase assay that Lunapark was a direct target of miR-126-3p. Overexpression of miR-126-3p in vitro led to a reduction in Lunapark protein levels and increased Perk (also known as Eif2ak3) mRNA levels and small interference-RNA mediated knockdown of Lunapark led to increased Xbp1, spliced Xbp1, Chop (also known as Ddit3) and Perk mRNA levels and an ER stress transcriptional response in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Consistent with the results found in vitro, increased miR-126-3p expression in adipose tissue from adult mouse offspring born to obese dams was accompanied by decreased Lunapark and IRS-1 protein levels and increased markers of ER stress. At the whole-body level the animals displayed glucose intolerance. Conclusions/interpretation Concurrently targeting IRS-1 and Lunapark, a nutritionally programmed increase in miR-126-3p causes adipose tissue insulin resistance and an ER stress response, both of which may contribute to impaired glucose tolerance. These findings provide a novel mechanism by which obesity during pregnancy leads to increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the offspring and therefore identify miR-126-3p as a potential therapeutic target.;;"University of Cambridge; Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Addenbrooke's Hospital; University of Cambridge; Universidade Estadual de Campinas; Universidade de Sao Paulo; University of Cambridge; Beatson Institute";;;;;;;;;;18;18;;;;;;;;;;;APR;2021;64;4;;;;;890;902;;10.1007/s00125-020-05357-4;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-020-05357-4;;JAN 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000611949700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Blocking of adipocyte differentiation is one of the anti-obesity strategies targeting on strong rise in fat storage and secretion of adipokine(s). However, the molecular basis of adipocyte differentiation and its regulation remains obscure. Therefore, we exposed 3T3-L1 cell line to appropriate hormonal inducers as adipocyte differentiation model. Using iTRAQ-coupled 2D LC-MS/MS, a successfully exploited high-throughput proteomic technology, we nearly quantitated 1,000 protein species and found 106 significantly altered proteins during adipocyte differentiation. The great majority of differentially expressed proteins were related to metabolism enzymes, structural molecules, and proteins involved in signal transduction. In addition to previously reported differentially expressed molecules, more than 20 altered proteins previously unknown to be involved with adipogenic process were firstly revealed (e. g., HEXB, DPP7, PTTG1IP, PRDX5, EPDR1, SPNB2, STEAP3, TPP1, etc.). The partially differential proteins were verified by Western blot and/or real-time PCR analysis. Furthermore, the association of PCX and VDAC2, two altered proteins, with adipocyte conversion was analyzed using siRNA method, and the results showed that they could contribute considerably to adipogenesis. In conclusion, our data provide valuable information for further understanding of adipogenesis. J. Cell. Biochem. 112: 3002-3014, 2011.

Dysregulation of O-GlcNAcylation may be involved in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it is necessary to identify cellular proteins that are induced by elevated O-GlcNAcylation. Here, using adenosine 5'-triphosphate affinity chromatography, we employed a proteomic approach in order to identify differentially expressed proteins in response to treatment with the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor, O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc), in mouse C2C12 myotube cells. Among 205 selected genes, we identified 68 nucleotide-binding proteins, 14 proteins that have adenosinetriphosphatase activity, and 10 proteins with ligase activity. Upregulation of proteins, including ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, proteasome subunit 20S, cullin-associated NEDD8-dissociated protein 1, ezrin, and downregulation of the protein nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, were confirmed by western blot analysis. In particular, we found that the protein ubiquitination level in C2C12 cells was increased by PUGNAc treatment. This is the first report of quantitative proteomic profiles of myotube cells after treatment with PUGNAc, and our results demonstrate the potential to enhance understanding of the relationship between insulin resistance, O-GlcNAc, and PUGNAc in the future.

However, the mechanism underlying its beneficial effects remains unclear. We investigated the inhibitory effects and mechanisms of HPE on insulin resistance, inflammation, and aortic injury in T2D rats, using metformin (MF) as a positive control. High-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLCESI-MS/MS) was used to determine the primary polyphenols in HPE. Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining was used to evaluate pathological conditions of the skeletal muscle, liver, and aorta vessels in each group. The levels of serum and intestinal tissue oxidative stress, tumor necrosis factor ? (TNF-?), and inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also assessed. Western blotting was used to evaluate protein expression levels in the associated molecular pathway. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from colon contents were determined using headspacegas chromatography-ion mobility chromatography. Our results showed that supplementation with 300 mg HPE/ kg body weight over four weeks significantly improved total cholesterol (TC), total triglyceride (TG), insulin, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in diabetic rats (p < 0.01). The lesions of skeletal muscle, liver, and aorta in diabetic rats were significantly improved. HPE supplementation also significantly downregulated the inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-?, and MCP-1) in the liver of diabetic rats via the SIRT1/AMPK/NF-?B signaling pathway. Furthermore, HPE significantly reduced insulin resistance in T2D rats by upregulating the phosphorylation of glucose absorption protein (GLUT4) and insulin resistance-associated proteins, p-IRS1, p-AKT, and pPI3K, in the rat liver (p < 0.01). The findings show that HPE could also alleviate aortic injury by activating SIRT1 and regulating the NF-?B and Wnt2/?-catenin signaling pathways. Overall, the results of this study suggest that both HPE and MF have similar inhibitory effects on T2D in rats and that HPE could be used as a functional food component in the adjuvant treatment of T2D.;;Hebei Normal University of Science & Technology;;;;;;;;;;40;44;;;;;;;;;;;APR;2021;142;;;;;;;;110239;10.1016/j.foodres.2021.110239;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2021.110239;;MAR 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000639157600005;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there is currently no technical platform that could measure these markers concurrently in a cost-effective manner. We have developed a new assay that is able to measure glucose, HbAlc, glycated HSA, and glycated apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-1) for monitoring of individual blood glycemia, as well as cysteinylated HSA, S-nitrosylated HbA, and methionine-oxidized apoA-1 for gauging oxidative stress and cardiovascular risks, all in 5 mu L of blood. The assay utilizes our proprietary multinozzle emitter array chip technology to enable the analysis of small volumes of blood, without complex sample preparation prior to the online and on-chip liquid chromatography-nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Importantly, the assay employs top-down proteomics for more accurate quantitation of protein levels and for identification of post-translational modifications. Further, the assay provides multimarker, multitime-scale, and multicompartment monitoring of blood glycemia.

Metabolic diseases such as obesity and type II diabetes mellitus as well as associated conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia lead to elevated levels of circulating estrogens. Increased estrogen concentrations, in turn, further trigger the proliferation of endometrial cells and thus promote EC development and progression, especially in the absence of progesterone as seen in postmenopausal women. Elevated blood glucose levels in diabetic patients further contribute to the risk of EC development. Metformin is an insulin-sensitizing biguanide drug, commonly used in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus, especially in obese patients. Besides its effects on glucose metabolism, metformin displayed anti-cancer effects in various cancer types, including EC. Direct anti-cancer effects of metformin target signaling pathways that are involved in cellular growth and proliferation, e.g. the AKT/PKB/mTOR pathway. Further proteins and pathways have been suggested as potential targets, but the underlying mechanism of action of metformin's anti-cancer activity is still not completely understood. In the present study, the effects of metformin on protein expression were investigated in the human EC cell line HEC-1A using an affinity proteomic approach. Cells were treated with 0.5 mmol/L metformin over a period of 7 days and changes in the expression pattern of 1,300 different proteins were compared to the expression in untreated control cells as well as insulin-treated cells. Insulin treatment (100 ng/mL) was incorporated into the study in order to implement a model for insulin resistance and associated hyperinsulinemia, conditions that are often observed in obese and diabetic patients. Furthermore, the culture medium was supplemented with 10 nmol/L ss-estradiol (E2) during treatments to mimic increased estrogen levels, a common risk factor for EC development. Based on the most prominent and significant changes in expression, a set of 80 proteins was selected and subjected to a more detailed analysis. The data revealed that metformin and insulin targeted similar pathways in the present study and mostly acted on proteins related to proliferation, migration and tumor immune response. These pathways may be affected in a tumor-promoting as well as a tumor-suppressing way by either metformin treatment or insulin supplementation. The consequences for the cells resulting from the detected expression changes were discussed in detail for several proteins. The presented data helps identify potential targets affected by metformin treatment in EC and allows for a better understanding of the mechanism of action of the biguanide drug's anti-cancer activity. However, further investigations are necessary to confirm the observations and conclusions drawn from the presented data after metformin administration, especially for proteins that were regulated in a favorable way, i.e. AKT3, CCND2, CD63, CD81, GFAP, IL5, IL17A, IRF4, PI3, and VTCN1.

DM is one of the most challenging health concerns of the 21st century. At least 30% of the diabetic population is undiagnosed at any one time, so effective and early diagnosis is of critical concern. Several of the body's chemicals, such as enzymes, electrolytes, and proteins, have been used as biomarkers in the diagnosis of diabetic diseases. Detection of LF is considered an important sign of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), due to its activity as an anti-inflammatory agent and in the down-regulation of pro-inflammation. LF is produced by glandular epithelial cells and neutrophils, and a decrease in its concentration is linked with the dysfunction of neutrophils in many diseases. Neutrophils are the first line of defence against pathogens that invade the human body during inflammation. Therefore, the health of neutrophils can be employed as a biomarker in the diagnosis of diseases such as diabetes. A decrease in LF concentrations in T2DM could result in increased levels of inflammatory markers that are associated with the inflammation activity. Increased understanding of the link between LF concentration and development of T2DM should improve early diagnosis and treatment outcomes. LF is identified through use of various techniques such as immunoassay, proteomics, and spectrometry. The aim of this review is to summarise each pathway and some of the most relevant LF biomarkers that may be used to monitor the development or progression of diabetes and its complications, and the link between levels of LF and neutrophil dysfunction in T2DM. Moreover, the objective of this review is to show the most common LF analysis that may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of T2DM and discuss to what extent this analysis method can be a tool for prognostic and diagnostic work.;;King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences;;;;;;;;;;3;3;;;;;;;;;;;;2021;33;58A;;;;;377;390;;10.9734/JPRI/2021/v33i58A34129;http://dx.doi.org/10.9734/JPRI/2021/v33i58A34129;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000738810600022;View Full Record in Web of Science

Design and methods: We used a biomarker-discovery population to find distinct metabolites of NAFLD patients with or without T2DM. Then, a validation population was applied to test the model of the biomarker-discovery population. All the individuals received anthropometric and common biochemical measurements. The metabolic data were analyzed by multivariable statistical analyses using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: There were 7,7,2 metabolites in the positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode, which were identified between groups from both the biomarker-discovery and validation population. The NAFLD group showed higher concentrations of oleamide, L-phenylalanine, L-proline, bilirubin, L-palmitoylcarnitine, and PC (20:5) and a lower concentration of Lyso-PAF C-18 than those of control. Compared with the control group, the NAFLD + T2DM group displayed higher oleamide, L-leucine, LysoPC (14:0), bilirubin, tetradecenoylcarnitine, linoleyl carnitine, and tetradecadiencarnitine in serum. Tetradecenoylcarnitine and tetradecadiencarnitine were more elevated in patients with NAFLD + T2DM than in the NAFLD group. Conclusions: Serum metabonomic analyses displayed great metabolic changes in patients with NAFLD and NAFLD plus T2DM. Our study is beneficial in providing a further view into the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of NAFLD and NAFLD plus T2DM, which might be useful for the prevention and therapy of NAFLD and NAFLD plus T2DM.

However, identifying HFpEF in individuals with type 2 diabetes early on is often challenging due to a limited array of biomarkers. This study aims to investigate specific biomarkers associated with the progression of HFpEF in individuals with type 2 diabetes, for the purpose of enabling early detection and more effective management strategies. Methods Blood samples were collected from individuals with type 2 diabetes, both with and without HFpEF, for proteomic analysis. Plasma integrin alpha 1 (ITGA1) levels were measured and compared between the two groups. Participants were further categorised based on ITGA1 levels and underwent detailed transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and during a median follow-up period of 30 months. Multivariable linear and Cox regression analyses were conducted separately to assess the associations between plasma ITGA1 levels and changes in echocardiography indicators and re-hospitalisation risk. Additionally, proteomic data for the individuals' left ventricles, from ProteomeXchange database, were analysed to uncover mechanisms underlying the change in ITGA1 levels in HFpEF. Results Individuals with type 2 diabetes and HFpEF showed significantly higher plasma ITGA1 levels than the individuals with type 2 diabetes without HFpEF. These elevated ITGA1 levels were associated with left ventricular remodelling and impaired diastolic function. Furthermore, during a median follow-up of 30 months, multivariable analysis revealed that elevated ITGA1 levels independently correlated with deterioration of both diastolic and systolic cardiac functions. Additionally, higher baseline plasma ITGA1 levels independently predicted re-hospitalisation risk (HR 2.331 [95% CI 1.387, 3.917], p=0.001). Proteomic analysis of left ventricular myocardial tissue provided insights into the impact of increased ITGA1 levels on cardiac fibrosis-related pathways and the contribution made by these changes to the development and progression of HFpEF. Conclusions/interpretation ITGA1 serves as a biomarker for monitoring cardiac structural and functional damage, can be used to accurately diagnose the presence of HFpEF, and can be used to predict potential deterioration in cardiac structure and function as well as re-hospitalisation for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Its measurement holds promise for facilitating risk stratification and early intervention to mitigate the adverse cardiovascular effects associated with diabetes.;;"University of Hong Kong; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, CAS; Sun Yat Sen University; Harbin Medical University; Shenzhen University; University of Hong Kong";;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;MAY;2024;67;5;;;;;850;863;;10.1007/s00125-024-06109-4;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-024-06109-4;;FEB 2024;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001181823800002;View Full Record in Web of Science

The 'Proteomic prediction and Renin angiotensin aldosterone system Inhibition prevention Of early diabetic nephRopathy In TYpe 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria trial' (PRIORITY) aims to evaluate the early detection of DN in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using a urinary proteome-based classifier (CKD273). In this ancillary study of the recently initiated PRIORITY trial we aimed to validate for the first time the CKD273 classifier in a multicentre (9 different institutions providing samples from 165 T2D patients) prospective setting. In addition we also investigated the influence of sample containers, age and gender on the CKD273 classifier. We observed a high consistency of the CKD273 classification scores across the different centres with areas under the curves ranging from 0.95 to 1.00. The classifier was independent of age (range tested 16-89 years) and gender. Furthermore, the use of different urine storage containers did not affect the classification scores. Analysis of the distribution of the individual peptides of the classifier over the nine different centres showed that fragments of blood-derived and extracellular matrix proteins were the most consistently found.

However, a complete understanding of protein changes within the diabetic vasculature is still lacking. Methods Herein, we utilized mass spectrometry to perform vascular and urinary proteome analysis using a rat model of high-fat feeding and low-dose streptozotocin to simulate late-stage T2D. The purpose of this study was to identify aortic and urine proteins that are differentially expressed in normal and T2D rats. Results High-fat feeding and low-dose streptozotocin resulted in hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia and high levels of circulating free fatty acids. Using a shotgun proteomic approach, high-mobility-group protein B1 and spondin-1 were significantly increased in T2D aorta compared to control aorta, suggesting vascular inflammation and smooth muscle proliferation, respectively. However, the majority of differentially expressed aortic proteins were downregulated in T2D, including proteins associated with coagulation, cell differentiation and redox homeostasis. Strikingly, we report a significant downregulation of commonly used cytoskeletal housekeeping proteins in T2D aorta. Urine from T2D rats displayed increased expression of proteins involved in inflammation and oxidative stress and decreased expression of proteins associated with lipid metabolism and cell adhesion. A number of differentially expressed proteins in urine of T2D rats have previously been reported in human T2D, thereby supporting this animal model as a good representation of human T2D.

The complement pathway proteins in hypoglycemia are not well studied. Here, we hypothesized that these circulating proteins would be elevated in response to hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D) through the inflammatory response. Methods: A prospective, parallel study in T2D (n = 23) and controls (n = 23). Subjects underwent insulin-induced hypoglycemia with blood sampling at baseline, hypoglycemia and post-hypoglycemia; SOMAscan proteomic analysis of complement pathway-related proteins, cytokines and inflammatory proteins was undertaken. Results: At baseline: Complement C2 (p < 0.05) and Factor B (p < 0.05) were elevated in T2D. At hypoglycemia: Complement C2 (p < 0.05) and Factor B (p < 0.01) remained elevated, whilst Factor I became elevated (p < 0.05) in T2D; Complement C4b became elevated in controls (p < 0.05). In the post hypoglycemia follow up period, Complement C2, Factor B and Factor I remained elevated in T2D; in addition, Factor D, Factor H and mannose-binding protein C showed elevations in T2D, whilst properdin, complement C3b, Factor H-related protein 5, complement C1q and decay-accelerating factor (DAF) showed elevations in controls. Granger causality analysis showed that inflammatory proteins appeared to drive complement protein changes in T2D; conversely, in controls, complement proteins drove inflammatory protein changes. Conclusions: Baseline elevations in C2 and Factor B indicate upregulation of the complement pathway in T2D. Changes in complement pathway-related protein levels in response to hypoglycemia suggest both intrinsic and alternative pathway activation at 2-h that appears driven by the underlying inflammation in T2D and could contribute to a cardiovascular event.

However, there is still a lack of ideal tumor markers for HCC detection in the T2DM population. Serum lipids have been revealed as potential tumor markers for HCC. In this study, our objective was to develop a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to detect several lipids including 8,15-dihydroxy-5,9,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (8,15-DiHETE), hexadecanedioic acid (HDA), 15-keto-13,14-dihydroprostaglandin A2 (DHK-PGA2), ricinoleic acid (RCL), octadecanedioic acid (OA) and 16-hydroxy hexadecanoic acid (16OHHA) in serum and explore their diagnostic potential for T2DM-positive [T2DM(+)] HCC. A robust LC-MS/MS method was established for the measurement of 8,15-DiHETE, HDA, DHK-PGA2, RCL, OA, and 16OHHA. The methodology validation was conducted, and the results suggested the reliability of this LC-MS/MS method for targeted lipids. Several serum lipids, including 8,15-DiHETE, HDA, DHK-PGA2, and OA were increased in T2DM(+) HCC patients. A biomarker signature that incorporated HDA, DHK-PGA2, and AFP was established and showed good diagnostic potential for T2DM(+) HCC, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.87 for diagnosing T2DM(+) HCC from T2DM individuals. Additionally, the biomarker signature diagnosed small-size (AUC = 0.88) and early-stage (AUC = 0.79) tumors with high efficacy. Moreover, the biomarker signature could differentiate T2DM(+) HCC from other T2DM(+) tumors, including pancreatic, gastric and colorectal cancer (AUC = 0.88) as well. In conclusion, our study develops a novel tool for early diagnosis of T2DM(+) HCC in T2DM patients.;;"Peking University; Peking University";;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2023;13;1;;;;;;;90;10.3390/metabo13010090;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo13010090;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000918676500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Resistant starch 3 (RS3), as a starch resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis owing to its special structure, has a good effect on improving insulin resistance and reducing blood sugar in T2DM patients. However, the possible mechanisms were barely interpreted yet. In our research, we aimed to evaluate the effects and the possible mechanisms of RS3 on the treatment of T2DM. ICR mice treated with high-fat diet (HFD) for eight weeks, and then injected with streptozotocin (STZ) (100 mg/kg) to establish the T2DM. We choose the mice with the fast blood glucose (FBG) more than 11 mmol/L as T2DM. After treated for 11 weeks the relevant data was analyzed. According to the results, the FBG was dramatically reduced (p < 0.05), which also downregulated triglyceride (p < 0.01) and total cholesterol (p < 0.01). Additionally, the insulin resistance indexes were significantly reduced (p < 0.01), the homeostasis model assessment-j3 and insulin-sensitive index were significantly im proved (p < 0.01) in RS3 group. Meanwhile, the metabolic profiles of urine were analyzed and 29 potential biomarkers were screened out, including amino acids and lipids.

The identification of new molecular targets associated both with islet cell dysfunction and protection is a crucial research goal. In the present study, a proteomics approach has been used to identify such targets. Obese C57BI/6J lep/lep mice and lean littermates were given the insulin sensitizer drug BRL49653, rosiglitazone. It normalized the impaired glucose tolerance in lep/lep mice but had no significant effect on glucose tolerance in the lean mice. Pancreatic islet polypeptides were arrayed by a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis system that separated more than 2500 individual spots. Three overexpressed and six underexpressed proteins were significant (p < 0.05) between lep/lep and lean mice, and four were modulated significantly (p < 0.05) by the rosiglitazone treatment of the obese mice. The identity of these differentially expressed proteins was made using mass spectrometric analysis and provided evidence that differential expression of actin-binding proteins may be an important aspect of defective islet function. Rosiglitazone increased carboxypeptidase B expression in both lep/lep and normal mice suggesting that this might be an independent effect of rosiglitazone that contributes to improved insulin processing.;;"University of Geneva; University of Buckingham";;;;;;;;;;66;75;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2002;1;7;;;;;509;516;;10.1074/mcp.M200033-MCP200;http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/mcp.M200033-MCP200;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000181515600003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite shared similarities, T1D is an autoimmune disease with evidence of autoantibody production, as well as a role for exocrine pancreas involvement. Our hypothesis is that differential protein expression occurs in disease stratified pancreas tissues and regulated proteins from endocrine and exocrine tissues are potential markers of disease and potential therapeutic targets. The study objective was to identify novel proteins that distinguish the pancreas from donors with T1D from the pancreas from patients with T2D, or autoantibody positive non-diabetic donors. Detailed quantitative comprehensive proteomic analysis was applied to snap frozen human pancreatic tissue lysates from organ donors without diabetes, with T1D-associated autoantibodies in the absence of diabetes, with T1D, or with T2D. These disease-stratified human pancreas tissues contain exocrine and endocrine tissues (with dysfunctional islets) in the same microenvironment. The expression profiles of several of the proteins were further verified by western blot. We identified protein panels that are significantly and uniquely upregulated in the three disease-stratified pancreas tissues compared to non-disease control tissues. These proteins are involved in inflammation, metabolic regulation, and autoimmunity, all of which are pathways linked to, and likely involved in, T1 and T2 diabetes pathogenesis. Several new proteins were differentially upregulated in prediabetic, T1D, and T2D pancreas. The results identify proteins that could serve as novel prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic tools to preserve functional islet mass in Type 1 Diabetes.;;"Eastern Virginia Medical School; Eastern Virginia Medical School; Eastern Virginia Medical School; Eastern Virginia Medical School; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Miami";;;;;;;;;;22;23;;;;;;;;;;;AUG 24;2015;10;8;;;;;;;e0135663;10.1371/journal.pone.0135663;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0135663;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000359951900025;View Full Record in Web of Science

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of Dopamine in the Substantia nigra of midbrain leading to cause motor dysfunction in affected people. TIIDM and PD have associations with each other as the individuals suffering from TIIDM are at more risk to develop PD in old age. The present study has analyzed eight (08) differentially expressed proteins in the Substantia nigra of TIIDM rat's brain by using Nano-LC-MS/MS method. Nano-LC-MS/MS is highly recommended technique for the identification & quantification of proteins. RPS27a, PSMC1, PSMa4, ATP8, ATP5f1d and CALM3 were down-regulated while PSMa3 and PRKACa were up-regulated in rat's brain. These differentially regulated proteins were further analyzed and found to be involved in the oxidative stress, mitochondria l dysfunction, Dopamine pathway, dysfunctional insulin signaling pathway, Ubiquitin regulatory pathways, and Ca2+ PD. In conclusion, the current study proposed a link between TIIDM and PD through primary estimated involvement of these proteins in both disorders. However, more in-depth molecular and proteomics studies are needed to be carried out for the possible expression of current proteins as target in the treatment and or prevention of PD in TIIDM patients. signaling pathways of both TIIDM and;;Islamia University of Bahawalpur;;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2023;60;10;;;;;779;789;;10.56042/ijbb.v60i10.214;http://dx.doi.org/10.56042/ijbb.v60i10.214;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001082582800003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Detection of patients who are prone to develop micro- or macroalbuminuria may represent an effective strategy to start or optimise therapeutic intervention. Here we assessed the value of a urinary proteomic-based risk score (classifier) in predicting the development and progression of microalbuminuria. We conducted a prospective case-control study. Cases (n = 44) and controls (n = 44) were selected from the PREVEND (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease) study and from the Steno Diabetes Center (Gentofte, Denmark). Cases were defined by transition from normo- to microalbuminuria or from micro- to macroalbuminuria over a follow-up of 3 years. Controls with no transitions in albuminuria were pair-matched for age, sex and albuminuria status. A model for the progression of albuminuria was built using a proteomic classifier based on 273 urinary peptides. The proteomic classifier was independently associated with transition to micro- or macroalbuminuria (OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.02, 1.79], p = 0.035). The classifier predicted the development and progression of albuminuria on top of albuminuria and estimated GFR (eGFR, area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve increase of 0.03, p = 0.002; integrated discrimination index [IDI]: 0.105, p = 0.002). Fragments of collagen and alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein showed significantly different expression between cases and controls. Although limited by the relatively small sample size, these results suggest that analysis of a urinary biomarker set enables early renal risk assessment in patients with diabetes.

The tablet is used to treat diabetes in China owing to its powerful hypoglycemic properties. However, little is known about the metabolic mechanisms underlying these properties. Methods: Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach was performed to explore the metabolic mechanism of JQJT in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Results: The metabolomic pathway analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database were used to screen out 25 potential biomarkers and construct pertinent metabolic pathways. Five metabolites, such as allantoic acid and taurine, were downregulated and 20 metabolites were upregulated in the urine of T2DM rats. The biomarkers in the JQJT group exhibited a good callback trend. It is speculated that JQJT can alleviate T2DM by regulating the disorders of taurine, hypotaurine, phenylalanine, ascorbate, and aldarate metabolism, as well as pentose and glucuronate interconversions. Conclusion: This study will be meaningful in the clinical application of JQJT and will be valuable for further exploration of the metabolic mechanisms underlying its properties.;;"Capital Medical University; Capital Medical University";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;MAY 1;2022;7;3;;;;;;;28;10.53388/TMR20220326273;http://dx.doi.org/10.53388/TMR20220326273;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000799873400011;View Full Record in Web of Science

We aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying cardiac dysfunction in an elderly type 2 diabetic (T2DM) mouse model, using membrane proteomic analyses. Elderly mice were fed a high fat diet for 12 weeks to induce T2DM, and myocardial structure and function were assessed by echocar-diography. Cardiomyocytes were isolated by Langendorff perfusion and subjected to iTRAQ-based quantitative membrane proteomic profiling, immunoblotting, and real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Compared to controls, elderly T2DM mice showed worse systolic function, more myocardial fibrosis and up-regulation of several heart failure markers (all p < 0.05). Cardiomyocyte membrane proteomic profiling revealed that 417 proteins had differential expressions related to perturbations in several biological processes in T2DM mice compared with the control. The most up-regulated proteins were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, whereas many down-regulated proteins were involved in cytoskeletal regulation. Differential protein expression correlated with myocardial systolic velocity by tissue Doppler. In addition, cardiomyocyte immunofluorescence staining showed greater disorganization of thick/parallel F-actin stress fibers and marked reduction in F-to-G-actin ratio in T2DM vs control (p < 0.05), which paralleled worsened myocardial systolic velocity. We concluded that cardiac contractile dysfunction in elderly T2DM mice was associated with impaired energetics and cytoskeletal disorganization.;;"Mackay Medical College; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Mackay Memorial Hospital; Mackay Memorial Hospital; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Taipei Medical University; Taipei Medical University; Mackay Memorial Hospital; Mackay Memorial Hospital; Mackay Junior College of Medicine, Nursing & Management; National Heart Centre Singapore";;;;;;;;;;6;6;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2017;16;10;;;;;3504;3513;;10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00148;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00148;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000412789400003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Other than for cardiovascular complications, diabetes is particularly challenging for the kidney's health and proper function. Prolonged exposure of the kidneys to hyperglycemia in fact often results in a clinical complication called diabetic glomerulosclerosis, also known as diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy represents today the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in Western countries. When left untreated or undiagnosed, diabetic nephropathy is ultimately responsible for the need for dialysis and, in the worst cases, kidney transplantation of the affected individuals. The pathogenesis Of diabetic nephropathy has been studied extensively. A great number of metabolites, cytokines, proteins and transcription factors play a role in the accumulation of extracellular matrix and mesangial proliferation in the glomerulus; importantly, these phenotypic alterations are considered the 2 histological hallmarks of diabetic nephropathy. Additional effort is however required to understand the wide network of biochemical pathways that link diabetes to the renal damage in the long run. The integrative analysis of the proteomic and transcriptomic features of body fluids and/or bioptic samples among different categories of patients affected by diabetic nephropathy, if based on the accurate classification of the histopathological changes in the glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartment, could lead to the identification of new early biomarkers.

We present here, seven DNAm-based estimators of plasma proteins including those of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and growth differentiation factor 15. The resulting predictor of lifespan, DNAm GrimAge (in units of years), is a composite biomarker based on the seven DNAm surrogates and a DNAm-based estimator of smoking pack-years. Adjusting DNAm GrimAge for chronological age generated novel measure of epigenetic age acceleration, AgeAccelGrim. Using large scale validation data from thousands of individuals, we demonstrate that DNAm GrimAge stands out among existing epigenetic clocks in terms of its predictive ability for time-to-death (Cox regression P= 2.0E-75), time-to-coronary heart disease (P= 6.2E-24), time-to-cancer (P= 1.3E-12), its strong relationship with computed tomography data for fatty liver/excess visceral fat, and age-at-menopause (P= 1.6E-12). AgeAccelGrim is strongly associated with a host of age-related conditions including comorbidity count (P= 3.45E-17). Similarly, age-adjusted DNAm PAI-1 levels are associated with lifespan (P= 5.4E-28), comorbidity count (P= 7.3E-56) and type 2 diabetes (P= 2.0E-26). These DNAm-based biomarkers show the expected relationship with lifestyle factors including healthy diet and educational attainment.

Abnormal glucose uptake and lipid oxidation are hallmark features of GDM prompting us to use an exploratory proteomics approach to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying differences in skeletal muscle metabolism between obese pregnant women with GDM (OGDM) and obese pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (ONGT). Functional validation was performed in a second cohort of obese OGDM and ONGT pregnant women. Quantitative proteomic analysis in rectus abdominus skeletal muscle tissue collected at delivery revealed reduced protein content of mitochondrial complex I (C-I) subunits (NDUFS3, NDUFV2) and altered content of proteins involved in calcium homeostasis/signaling (calcineurin A, alpha 1-syntrophin, annexin A4) in OGDM (n = 6) vs. ONGT (n = 6). Follow-up analyses showed reduced enzymatic activity of mitochondrial complexes C-I, C-III, and C-IV (-60-75%) in the OGDM (n = 8) compared with ONGT (n = 10) subjects, though no differences were observed for mitochondrial complex protein content. Upstream regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation were not different between groups. However, AMPK phosphorylation was dramatically reduced by 75% in the OGDM women. These data suggest that GDM is associated with reduced skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation and disordered calcium homeostasis.

We have extensively analysed visceral adipose tissue from age-, T2DM- and gender-matched obese patients using high-throughput proteomics and systems biology methods to identify new biomarkers for the onset of T2DM in obesity, as well as to gain insight into the influence of aging and gender in these disorders. About 250 proteins showed significant abundance differences in the age, T2DM and gender comparisons. In diabetic patients, remarkable gender-specific hallmarks were discovered regarding redox status, immune response and adipose tissue accumulation. Both aging and T2DM processes were associated with mitochondrial remodelling, albeit through well-differentiated proteome changes.

The current study was designed to screen the feature metabolites classified as potential biomarkers, and to provide deeper insights into the underlying distinctive metabolic changes during disease progression. Materials and MethodsPlasma metabolite profiles were obtained by the ultra-high liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry method from healthy control participants, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and patients with DSPN. Potential biomarkers were selected through comprehensive analysis of statistically significant differences between groups. ResultsOverall, 938 metabolites were identified. Among them, 12 metabolites (dimethylarginine, N6-acetyllysine, N-acetylhistidine, N,N,N-trimethyl-alanylproline betaine, cysteine, 7-methylguanine, N6-carbamoylthreonyladenosine, pseudouridine, 5-methylthioadenosine, N2,N2-dimethylguanosine, aconitate and C-glycosyl tryptophan) were identified as the specific biomarkers. The content of 12 metabolites were significantly higher in the DSPN group compared with the other two groups. Additionally, they showed good performance to discriminate the DSPN state. Correlation analyses showed that the levels of 12 metabolites might be more closely related to the glucose metabolic changes, followed by the levels of lipid metabolism. ConclusionsThe finding of the 12 signature metabolites might provide a novel perspective for the pathogenesis of DSPN.

Being a heterogeneous metabolic condition, it is pertinent to understand the metabolites and metabolic pathways that are altered during the development and progression of IR toward T2DM. Serum samples were collected from C57BL/6J mice fed with HFD or chow diet (CD) for 16 weeks. Collected samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Data on the identified raw metabolites were evaluated using a combination of univariate and multivariate statistical methods. Mice fed with HFD had glucose and insulin intolerance associated with impairment of insulin signaling in key metabolic tissues. From the GC-MS/MS analysis of serum samples, a total of 75 common annotated metabolites were identified between HFD- and CD-fed mice. In the t-test, 22 significantly altered metabolites were identified. Out of these, 16 metabolites were up-accumulated, whereas 6 metabolites were down-accumulated. Pathway analysis identified 4 significantly altered metabolic pathways. In particular, primary bile acid biosynthesis and linoleic acid metabolism were upregulated, whereas the TCA cycle and pentose and glucuronate interconversion were downregulated in HFD-fed mice in comparison to CD-fed mice. These results show the distinct metabolic profiles associated with the onset of IR that could provide promising metabolic biomarkers for diagnostic and clinical applications.;;"King George's Medical University; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI); University of Milan";;;;;;;;;;8;9;;;;;;;;;;;APR 21;2023;6;5;;;;;771;782;;10.1021/acsptsci.3c00028;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsptsci.3c00028;;APR 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000979356600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

We interrogated urine proteomic profiles generated by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry with the aim of isolating a set of biomarkers able to reliably identify biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy and to establish a stringent correlation with the different patterns of renal injury. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS- Ten micrograms of urine proteins from 190 subjects (20 healthy subjects, 20 normoalbuminuric, and 18 microalbuminuric diabetic patients and 132 patients with biopsy-proven nephropathy: 65 diabetic nephropathy, 10 diabetic with nondiabetic CKD [nd-CKD], and 57 nondiabetic with CKD) were run using a CM 10 ProteinChip array and analyzed by supervised learning methods (Classification and Regression Tree analysis). RESULTS- The classification model correctly identified 75% of patients with normoalbuminuria, 87.5% of those with microalbuminuria, and 87.5% of those with diabetic nephropathy when applied to a blinded testing set. Most importantly, it was able to reliably differentiate diabetic nephropathy from nd-CKD in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Among the best predictors of the classification model, we identified and validated two proteins, ubiquitin and beta(2-)microglobulin. CONCLUSIONS- Our data suggest the presence of a specific urine proteomic signature able to reliably identify type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic glomerulosclerosis.;;"University of Foggia; Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia; University of Foggia; University of Foggia; IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna; IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza; University of Foggia";;;;;;;;;;68;72;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2010;33;11;;;;;2409;2415;;10.2337/dc10-0345;http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc10-0345;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000284516400022;View Full Record in Web of Science

TB-T2D comorbidity worsens clinical control and prognosis of the affected individuals. The underlying metabolic alterations for this infectious-metabolic disease are still largely unknown. Possible mediators of the increased susceptibility to TB in diabetic patients are lipids levels, which are altered in individuals with T2D. To evaluate the modulation of glycerophospholipids in patients with TB-T2D, an untargeted lipidomic approach was developed by means of ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-QToF). In addition, tandem mass spectrometry was performed to determine the identity of the differentially expressed metabolites. We found that TB infected individuals with or without T2D share a common glycerophospholipid profile characterized by a decrease in phosphatidylcholines. A total of 14 glycerophospholipids were differentially deregulated in TB and TB-T2D patients and could potentially be considered biomarkers. It is necessary to further validate these identified lipids as biomarkers, focusing on the anticipate diagnosis for TB development in T2D predisposed individuals. (C) 2019 IMSS.

Here, we aimed to characterize the previously undefined role of disrupted AdipoR1 signaling on the mitochondrial protein composition of cardiac, renal, and hepatic tissues as three organs principally associated with diabetic complications. Comparative proteomics were performed in mitochondria isolated from the heart, kidneys and liver of Adipor1(-/-) mice. A total of 790, 1,573, and 1,833 proteins were identified in cardiac, renal and hepatic mitochondria, respectively. While 121, 98, and 78 proteins were differentially regulated in cardiac, renal, and hepatic tissue of Adipor1(-/-) mice, respectively; only 15 proteins were regulated in the same direction across all investigated tissues. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins revealed disproportionate representation of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation conserved across tissue types. Curated pathway analysis identified HNF4, NRF1, LONP, RICTOR, SURF1, insulin receptor, and PGC-1 alpha as candidate upstream regulators. In high fat-fed non-transgenic mice with obesity and insulin resistance, AdipoR1 gene expression was markedly reduced in heart (-70%), kidney (-80%), and liver (-90%) (all P < 0.05) as compared to low fat-fed mice. NRF1 was the only upstream regulator downregulated both in Adipor1(-/-) mice and in high fat-fed mice, suggesting common mechanisms of regulation. Thus, AdipoR1 signaling regulates mitochondrial protein composition across all investigated tissues in a functionally conserved, yet molecularly distinct, manner.

The ability of beta-cells to proliferate upon certain stimuli, such as elevated glucose concentration, is an essential property to overpass a major problem of the pathology: the decrease of beta-cell mass leading to a lack of insulin production. However, high glucose concentrations are also an inducer of beta-cell dysfunction, when proliferation become unable to overcome insulin demand. The control of beta-cell proliferation could represent an interesting target for the development of therapeutic molecules for type 2 diabetes treatment. To get new insights on beta-cell replication, we investigated the modulation of nuclear proteins of INS-1E cells submitted to medium and high glucose concentrations for 24 h. Indeed, the nucleus should contain proteins responsible of proliferation-related events. The SILAC approach allowed us identifying 24 nuclear proteins whose expressions were modified by chronic high glucose. A wide Downstream Effects Analysis assigned the majority of the differentially expressed proteins to functions such as proliferation and cell cycle. Interestingly, our study linked for the first time the increase of expression of the 6 MCM components to glucose-induced stimulation in beta-cells. Biological significance The current study represents a progress in the understanding of glucose-induced proliferation mechanisms in beta-cells. We applied the SILAC strategy to INS-1E cells cultivated with medium or high glucose concentrations for 24 h, and we targeted nuclear proteins which have a central role in proliferation-related mechanisms. It allows quantifying 24 nuclear proteins, which are regulated by high glucose exposure. The vast majority of them are shown to be related to proliferation and cell cycle. We describe here for the first time than the 6 proteins of the MCM complex are involved in glucose-mediated proliferation in beta-cells. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to investigate whether a glucagon receptor (GCGR) monoclonal antibody (mAb) ameliorated diabetic cardiomyopathy and clarify whether and how CMECs participated in the process. Research Design and Methods: The db/db mice were treated with GCGR mAb or immunoglobulin G (as control) for 4 weeks. Echocardiography was performed to evaluate cardiac function. Immunofluorescent staining was used to determine microvascular density. The proteomic signature in isolated primary CMECs was analyzed by using tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomic analysis. Some target proteins were verified by using western blot. Results: Compared with db/m mice, cardiac microvascular density and left ventricular diastolic function were significantly reduced in db/db mice, and this reduction was attenuated by GCGR mAb treatment. A total of 199 differentially expressed proteins were upregulated in db/db mice versus db/m mice and downregulated in GCGR mAb-treated db/db mice versus db/db mice. The enrichment analysis demonstrated that fatty acid beta-oxidation and mitochondrial fusion were the key pathways. The changes of the related proteins carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B, optic atrophy type 1, and mitofusin-1 were further verified by using western blot. The levels of these three proteins were upregulated in db/db mice, whereas this upregulation was attenuated by GCGR mAb treatment. Conclusion: GCGR antagonism has a protective effect on CMECs and cardiac diastolic function in diabetic mice, and this beneficial effect may be mediated via inhibiting fatty acid beta-oxidation and mitochondrial fusion in CMECs.;;Southwest Medical University;;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2023;15;12;;;;;1081;1094;;10.1111/1753-0407.13458;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1753-0407.13458;;AUG 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001051238100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The ages of diabetes are decreasing, so ocular surface status in younger generations is worthy of attention. We used tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled proteomics and weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify differentially expressed proteins in the tear proteome of adults and children with diabetic DE. Methods: Study subjects were divided into six groups of 10, including three groups each for adults and children. The adult groups included diabetics with DE (A), diabetics without DE (B), and normal controls (C); the corresponding groups of children were identified as (D), (E), and (F). DE tests were performed on all subjects. We extracted total proteins and labeled them with TMTs for analysis. WGCNA was used to recognize hub genes. Results: Tear film function was poorer in patients with diabetic DE. In adults, 1922 proteins were identified, and WGCNA analysis revealed three hub genes related to diabetic DE. For children, 2709 proteins were identified, and WGCNA analysis identified one hub gene related to diabetic DE. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis found similarities among metabolic pathways involved in differential expression of proteins in adult and child tear samples. Conclusions: The pathogenesis of diabetic DE was highly similar in adults and children.

In humans, the accumulation of omental rather than subcutaneous fat appears to be tightly linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Differences in gene expression profiles in the adipose tissue comparing non-obese and obese subjects have been well documented. However, to date, no comparative proteomic studies based on omental fat have investigated the influence of obesity in protein expression. In this work, we searched for proteins differentially expressed in the omental fat of non-obese and obese subjects using 2D-DIGE and MS. Forty-four proteins, several of which were further studied by immunoblotting and immunostaining analyses, showed significant differences in the expression levels in the two groups of subjects. Our findings reveal a clearly distinctive proteomic profile between obese and non-obese subjects which emphasizes: i) reduced metabolic activity in the obese fat, since most down-regulated proteins were engaged in metabolic pathways; and ii) morphological and structural cell changes in the obese fat, as revealed by the functions exerted by most up-regulated proteins. Interestingly, transketolase and aminoacylase-1 represent newly described molecules involved in the pathophysiology of obesity, thus opening up new possibilities in the study of obesity.

It is therefore of critical importance the early diagnosis of DM2 patients and the detection of those at increased risk of disease. In this respect, Precision Medicine (PM) is an emerging approach that includes practices, tests, decisions and treatments adapted to the characteristics of each patient. With regard to DM2, PM manages a wealth of omics data (genomic, metabolic, proteomic, environmental, clinical and paraclinical) to increase the number of clinically validated biomarkers in order to identify patients in early stage even before the prediabetic phase. Significance: In this paper, we discuss the epidemic dimension of metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and the urgent demand for novel biomarkers to reduce the incidence or even delay the onset of DM2. Recent research data produced by multi-omics technologies (genomics/epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics), suggest that many potential biomarkers might be helpful in the prediction and early diagnosis of DM2. Predictive, Preventive and Personalized Medicine (PPPM) manages and integrates these data to apply personalized, preventive, and therapeutic approaches.

Hypoxia in adipose tissue has been associated with altered adipokine secretion profile and suggested as a possible factor in the development of type 2 diabetes. In vitro experiments provide an indispensable tool in metabolic research, however, physical laws of gas diffusion make prolonged exposure of adherent cells to desired pericellular O-2 concentrations questionable. The aim of this study was to investigate the direct effect of various O-2 levels (1%, 4% and 20% O-2) on the proteomic profile and triglyceride accumulation in 3T3-L1 differentiated preadipocytes using gas-permeable cultureware. Following differentiation of cells under desired pericellular O-2 concentrations, cell lysates were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein visualization using Coomassie blue staining. Spots showing differential expression under hypoxia were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. All identified proteins were subjected to pathway analysis. We observed that protein expression of 26 spots was reproducibly affected by 4% and 1% O-2 (17 upregulated and 9 downregulated). Pathway analysis showed that mitochondrial energy metabolism and triglyceride synthesis were significantly upregulated by hypoxia. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the direct effects of pericellular O-2 levels on adipocyte energy metabolism and triglyceride synthesis, probably mediated through the reversed tricarboxylic acid cycle flux.;;"Charles University Prague; Charles University Prague; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; National Institute of Public Health (SZU) - Czech Republic; University Hospital Vinohrady";;;;;;;;;;14;14;;;;;;;;;;;MAR 29;2016;11;3;;;;;;;e0152382;10.1371/journal.pone.0152382;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152382;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000373113900051;View Full Record in Web of Science

Metabolomics could provide novel insights into the pathogenesis, so we aimed to explore serum metabolomic profiles from DN to T2DM. Serum samples were collected from 14 biopsy-proven DNs, 14 age/gender-matched T2DMs without renal diseases (DM), 14 age/gender-matched healthy controls (CTRL) and household contacts of DM group (HH). Serum metabolomics was analyzed by untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS) assays. There were a total of 1470 metabolites identified from all serum samples. 45 metabolites with significantly different intensity were found between DN and DM, e.g., biliverdin and taurine were reduced while l-arginine was increased in DN comparing to DM. DN could be distinguished from age/gender matched DM patients by l-arginine (AUC = 0.824) or taurine levels (AUC = 0.789). The metabolic pathways affected by metabolite distinctions between DN and DM also existed, among which taurine and hypotaurine metabolism exhibited the highest pathway impact. l-Methionine, deethylatrazine, l-tryptophan and fumaric acid were reduced in DM comparing with those of CTRL, but had no different intensity in DM and HH groups. The changes were demonstrated in the metabolomic profiles of biopsy-proven DN compared to DM.

The case-cohort was 61% male with a mean age of 67 years. All participants had type 2 diabetes mellitus with >= 1 additional cardiovascular risk factors, and 35% had a history of macrovascular disease. Weighted Cox regression was used to identify lipid species associated with future cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death) and cardiovascular death during a 5-year follow-up period. Multivariable models combining traditional risk factors with lipid species were optimized with the Akaike information criteria. C statistics and NRIs were calculated within a 5-fold cross-validation framework. RESULTS: Sphingolipids, phospholipids (including lyso-and ether-species), cholesteryl esters, and glycerolipids were associated with future cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. The addition of 7 lipid species to a base model (14 traditional risk factors and medications) to predict cardiovascular events increased the C statistic from 0.680 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.678-0.682) to 0.700 (95% CI, 0.698-0.702; P<0.0001) with a corresponding continuous NRI of 0.227 (95% CI, 0.219-0.235). The prediction of cardiovascular death was improved with the incorporation of 4 lipid species into the base model, showing an increase in the C statistic from 0.740 (95% CI, 0.738-0.742) to 0.760 (95% CI, 0.757-0.762; P<0.0001) and a continuous net reclassification index of 0.328 (95% CI, 0.317-0.339). The results were validated in a subcohort with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=511) from the LIPID trial (Long-Term Intervention With Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease). CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in the prediction of cardiovascular events, above traditional risk factors, demonstrates the potential of plasma lipid species as biomarkers for cardiovascular risk stratification in diabetes mellitus.";;"Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute; University of Melbourne; University of Sydney; Monash University; University of Sydney; NSW Health; Royal Prince Alfred Hospital; Universite Paris Cite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Hopital Universitaire Bichat-Claude Bernard - APHP; Universite Paris Cite; George Institute for Global Health; University of Sydney; University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London; University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; University of Western Australia; East Metropolitan Health Service; Royal Perth Hospital; University of Oxford; Johns Hopkins University";;;;;;;;;;191;198;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 22;2016;134;21;;;;;1637;+;;10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.023233;http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.023233;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000388466500013;View Full Record in Web of Science

The single-cell analysis combined with proteoform data places new protein targets within the specific time point and at the specific pancreatic lineage of differentiating stem cells. We suggest that non-correlating proteins abundances or new phosphorylation motifs of NKX6.1 and CHGA point to new signaling pathways that may play an essential role in beta-cell development.

The insulin sensitizer drug, rosiglitazone, has been shown to bind and activate PPAR-gamma1 in adipocytes and PPAR-gamma2 in hepatocytes. The identification of new molecular targets associated with fatty acid oxidation and PPAR-gamma nuclear receptor regulation in insulin resistance tissues is a key research goal. In the present study, we have used a proteomic approach to identify such targets. Lean and obese C57 BI/6J lep/lep mice were given BRL49653, rosiglitazone, 10 mg/kg diet, by dietary admixture for 7 days. Rosiglitazone normalized the impaired glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia in lep/lep mice but had no significant effect in the lean mice. Samples of liver, white and brown adipose tissue, and muscle proteins were obtained and 100 mug of proteins was arrayed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Thirty-four polypeptides were differentially expressed (p < 0.05) between lep/lep and lean mice and eleven were significantly (p < 0.05) modulated by rosiglitazone treatment of the obese mice. None of the proteins was modulated by rosiglitazone treatment of the lean mice. The identity of these differentially expressed proteins was made using tandem mass spectrometric analysis and revealed components of fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism as well as proteins with unknown function.;;"University of Geneva; University of Buckingham";;;;;;;;;;49;56;;;;;;;;;;;AUG;2003;3;8;;;;;1500;1520;;10.1002/pmic.200300484;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pmic.200300484;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000185031500015;View Full Record in Web of Science

We previously reported that apoptosis of INS-1 insulinoma cells due to thapsigargin-induced ER stress was suppressed by inhibition of the group VIA Ca2+-independent phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2)beta), associated with an increased level of ceramide generation, and that the effects of ER stress were amplified in INS-1 cells in which iPLA(2)beta was overexpressed (OE INS-1 cells). These findings suggested that iPLA(2)beta and ceramides participate in ER stress-induced INS-1 cell apoptosis. Here, we address this possibility and also the source of the ceramides by examining the effects of ER stress in empty vector (V)-transfected and iPLA(2)beta-OE INS-1 cells using apoptosis assays and immunoblotting, quantitative PCR, and mass spectrometry analyses. ER stress induced expression of ER stress factors GRP78 and CHOP, cleavage of apoptotic factor PARP, and apoptosis in V and OE INS-1 cells. Accumulation of ceramide during ER stress was not associated with changes in mRNA levels of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo synthesis of ceramides, but both message and protein levels of neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase), which hydrolyzes sphingomyelins to generate ceramides, were temporally increased in the INS-1 cells. The increases in the level of NSMase expression in the ER-stressed INS-1 cells were associated with corresponding temporal elevations in ER-associated iPLA(2)beta protein and catalytic activity. Pretreatment with BEL inactivated iPLA(2)beta and prevented induction of NSMase message and protein in ER-stressed INS-1 cells. Relative to that in V INS-1 cells, the effects of ER stress were accelerated and/or amplified in the OE INS-1 cells. However, inhibition of iPLA(2)beta or NSMase (chemically or with siRNA) suppressed induction of NSMase message, ceramide generation, sphingomyelin hydrolysis, and apoptosis in both V and OE INS-1 cells during ER stress. In contrast, inhibition of SPT did not suppress ceramide generation or apoptosis in either V or OE INS-1 cells. These findings indicate that iPLA(2)beta activation participates in ER stress-induced INS-1 cell apoptosis by promoting ceramide generation via NSMase-catalyzed hydrolysis of sphingomyelins, raising the possibility that this pathway contributes to beta-cell apoptosis due to ER stress.;;"Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL)";;;;;;;;;;73;79;;;;;;;;;;;SEP 4;2007;46;35;;;;;10170;10185;;10.1021/bi700017z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi700017z;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000249021100033;View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of palmitate-induced beta cell dysfunction and death, combined or not with high glucose. Protein profiling of INS-1E cells, exposed to 0.5 mmol/L palmitate and combined or not with 25 mmol/L glucose, for 24 h was done by 2D-DIGE, both on full cell lysate and on an enriched endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fraction. Eighty-three differentially expressed proteins (P < 0.05) were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry and proteomic results were confirmed by functional assays. 2D-DIGE analysis of whole cell lysates and ER enriched samples revealed a high number of proteins compared to previous reports. Palmitate induced beta cell dysfunction and death via ER stress, hampered insulin maturation, generation of harmful metabolites during triglycerides synthesis and altered intracellular trafficking. In combination with high glucose, palmitate induced increased shunting of excess glucose, increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and an elevation in many transcription-related proteins. This study contributes to a better understanding and revealed novel mechanisms of palmitate-induced beta cell dysfunction and death and may provide new targets for drug discovery.;;"KU Leuven; KU Leuven; KU Leuven; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universite Libre de Bruxelles";;;;;;;;;;39;43;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2013;12;1;;;;;347;362;;10.1021/pr300596g;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr300596g;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000313156300031;View Full Record in Web of Science

Whereas an overload of long-chain fatty acids can induce muscle insulin resistance, butyrate, a short -chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced from dietary fibre fermentation, prevents it. This preventive role of butyrate has been attributed to histone deacetylase (HDAC)-mediated transcription regulation and activation of mito-chondrial fatty-acid oxidation. Here we address the interplay between butyrate and the long-chain fatty acid palmitate and investigate how transcription, signalling and metabolism are integrated to result in the butyrate -induced skeletal muscle metabolism remodelling. Butyrate enhanced insulin sensitivity in palmitate-treated, insulin-resistant C2C12 cells, as shown by elevated insulin receptor 1 (IRS1) and pAKT protein levels and Slc2a4 (GLUT4) mRNA, which led to a higher glycolytic capacity. Long-chain fatty-acid oxidation capacity and other functional respiration parameters were not affected. Butyrate did upregulate mitochondrial proteins involved in its own oxidation, as well as concentrations of butyrylcarnitine and hydroyxybutyrylcarnitine. By knocking down the gene encoding medium-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (MCKAT, Acaa2), butyrate oxidation was inhibited, which amplified the effects of the SCFA on insulin sensitivity and glycolysis. This response was associated with enhanced HDAC inhibition, based on histone 3 acetylation levels. Butyrate enhances insulin sensitivity and induces glycolysis, without the requirement of upregulated long-chain fatty acid oxidation. Butyrate catabolism functions as an escape valve that attenuates HDAC inhibition. Thus, inhibition of butyrate oxidation indirectly prevents insulin resistance and stimulates glycolytic flux in myotubes treated with butyrate, most likely via an HDAC-dependent mechanism.;;"University of Groningen; University of Groningen; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC)";;;;;;;;;;8;9;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 1;2022;1868;11;;;;;;;166476;10.1016/j.bbadis.2022.166476;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2022.166476;;JUL 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000830834300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has attained the status of a global pandemic; however, the difference in salivary protein glycosylation between healthy subjects and patients with T2DM has not been fully understood. In the present study, salivary specimens from patients with T2DM (n = 72) and healthy volunteers (HVs, n = 80) were enrolled and divided into discovery and validation cohorts. A method combining the lectin microarray and lectin blotting was employed to investigate and confirm the altered glycopatterns in salivary glycoproteins. Then, lectin-mediated affinity capture of glycoproteins and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS were performed to obtain the precise structural information of the altered glycans. As a result, the glycopatterns recognized by 5 lectins (LEL, VVA, Jacalin, RCA120 and DSA) showed significant alteration in the saliva of T2DM patients. Notably, the glycopattern of Gal beta-1,4GlcNAc (LacNAc) recognized by LEL exhibited a significant increase in T2DM patients compared to HVs in both discovery and validation cohorts. The MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS results indicated that there were 10 and 7 LacNAc-containing N/O-glycans (e.g. m/z 1647.586, 11 688.613 and 1562.470) that were identified only in T2DM patients. Besides, the relative abundance of 3 LacNAc-containing N-glycans and 10 LacNAc-containing O-glycans showed an increase in the glycopattern in T2DM patients. These results indicated that the glycopattern of LacNAc is increased in salivary glycoproteins from T2DM patients, and an increase in LacNAc-containing N/O-glycans may contribute to this alteration.

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the progression of diabetic nephropathy in GK rats remain unclear. Kidneys from 15-week old male diabetic GK/Jcl rats and age-matched Wistar rats, which have the same genetic background as GK rats, were used. Proteomic analyses of GK and Wistar kidneys were performed using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Differentially expressed proteins in GK rats were subjected to pathway analysis, and expression levels of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), and fumarate accumulation in GK kidneys were examined. Azan staining and immunohistochemical staining of alpha-smooth muscle actin were performed in relation to fibrosis in GK kidneys. Proteomic analysis using 2D-DIGE, analysis of fumarate content, and expression analysis of HIF-1 alpha, TGF-beta 1, and alpha-smooth muscle actin of GK rat's kidney, suggested the mechanism of fibrosis characterized as two stages in diabetic nephropathy of GK rats. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism such as elevated levels of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and reduction of fumarate hydratase caused the accumulation of fumarate followed by the upregulation of HIF-1 alpha and TGF-beta 1 leading to fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) arises from a dysregulated response to elevated glucose levels in the circulation. Globally, the prevalence of T2D has increased dramatically in all age groups. T2D in older adults is associated with higher mortality and reduced functional status, leading to higher rate of institutionalization. Despite the potential healthcare challenges associated with the presence of T2D in the elderly, the pathogenesis and phenotype of late-onset T2D is not well studied. Here we applied untargeted metabolite profiling of urine samples from people with and without late-onset T2D using ultra-performance liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to identify urinary biomarkers for late-onset T2D in the elderly. Statistical modeling of measurements and thorough validation of structural assignment using liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) have led to the identification of metabolite biomarkers associated with late-onset T2D. Lower levels of phenylalanine, acetylhistidine, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were found in urine samples of T2D subjects validated with commercial standards.

Methods: Two iatrogenic hypoglycemia studies were compared; firstly, mild hypoglycemia in 18 subjects (10 type 2 diabetes (T2D), 8 controls; blood glucose to 2.8 mmoL/L (50 mg/dL) for 1 h), and secondly, severe hypoglycemia in 46 subjects (23 T2D, 23 controls; blood glucose to <2.2 mmoL/L (<40 mg/dL) transiently followed by intravenous glucose reversal giving rebound hyperglycemia). A SOMAscan assay was used to measure 54 of the 92 cardiovascular protein biomarkers that reflect biomarkers involved in inflammation, cellular metabolic processes, cell adhesion, and immune response and complement activation. Results: Baseline to euglycemia showed no change in any of the proteins measured in the T2D cohort. With severe hypoglycemia, the study controls showed an increase in Angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1) (p < 0.01) and Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) (p < 0.01), but no changes were seen with mild hypoglycemia. In both the mild and severe hypoglycemia studies, at the point of hypoglycemia, T2D subjects showed suppression of Brother of CDO (BOC) (p < 0.01).

ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), a key enzyme in cellular lipid production, was identified as a palmitate target in a proteomic screen. We investigated the effects of palmitate on ACLY activity and phosphorylation and its role in beta cell ER stress and apoptosis. We demonstrated that treatment of MIN6 cells, mouse islets and human islets with palmitate reduced ACLY protein levels. These in vitro results were validated by our finding that islets from high fat-fed mice had a significant decrease in ACLY, similar to that previously observed in type 2 diabetic human islets. Palmitate decreased intracellular acetyl-CoA levels to a similar degree as the ACLY inhibitor, SB-204990, suggesting a reduction in ACLY activity. ACLY inhibitors alone were sufficient to induce CCAAT/enhancer- binding protein homologues protein (CHOP)-dependent ER stress and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Similarly, even modest shRNA-mediated knockdown of ACLY caused a significant increase in beta cell apoptosis and ER stress. The effects of chemical ACLY inhibition and palmitate were nonadditive and therefore potentially mediated by a common mechanism. Indeed, overexpression of ACLY prevented palmitate-induced beta cell death. These observations provide new evidence that ACLY expression and activity can be suppressed by exogenous lipids and demonstrate a critical role for ACLY in pancreatic beta cell survival. These findings add to the emerging body of evidence linking beta cell metabolism with programmed cell death.;;"University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia";;;;;;;;;;53;59;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 15;2010;285;42;;;;;32606;32615;;10.1074/jbc.M110.157172;http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M110.157172;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000282683000075;View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective This study assessed HDL-bound proteins in patients with NAFLD with or without advanced fibrosis. Methods This cross-sectional study at a university hospital included 185 patients with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D). Patients underwent liver proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure intrahepatic triglyceride accumulation and those with NAFLD underwent a percutaneous liver biopsy. Advanced lipid testing with lipoprotein subfraction measurements and targeted proteomics of HDL-bound proteins was performed. Results Patients with and without advanced fibrosis had similar clinical characteristics, except for lower HDL-C (34 +/- 8 vs 38 +/- 9 mg/dL, P = 0.024) and higher prevalence of T2D in advanced fibrosis. Patients with advanced fibrosis had lower HDL particle number. A panel of 28 HDL-bound proteins were targeted and quantified by multiple reaction monitoring liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Five proteins were found to be decreased in patients with advanced fibrosis (ApoC-I [P < 0.001], ApoC-IV [P = 0.012], ApoM [P = 0.008], LCAT [P = 0.014], and SAA4 [P = 0.016]). No differences were observed in these proteins in patients with vs without NAFLD or steatohepatitis. The pCAD index, associated with coronary artery disease and cardiovascular mortality, was significantly higher in patients with advanced fibrosis (97 +/- 5 vs 86 +/- 25, P = 0.04). Conclusion Patients with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis showed significant differences in HDL-bound protein levels; this translated into increased cardiovascular risk based on pCAD index. Different lipoprotein composition and function may explain the link between liver disease and increased cardiovascular mortality in these patients.";;"University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); Veterans Affairs Medical Center - Birmingham; Nichols Institute";;;;;;;;;;5;5;;;;;;;;;;;2022 SEP 29;2022;;;;;;;;;;10.1210/clinem/dgac565;http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgac565;;SEP 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000868667000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Several promising biomarkers were further validated in independent cohorts using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Thirty-nine differentially expressed plasma proteins were identified between AAA and HC. Legumain (LGMN) was significantly higher in AAA patients and was validated in another large cohort. Additionally, AAA without diabetes (AAN) patients and AAA complicated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (AAM) patients had different cytokine expression patterns in their plasma, and nine plasma proteins were differentially expressed among the AAN, AAM, and HC subjects. Delta-like protein 1 (DLL1), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3 (ERBB3), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPPIV) were significantly higher in AAM than in AAN.

A gelsolin isoform is secreted into the plasma as part of the extracellular actin scavenger system which serves a protective role by digesting and removing actin filaments released from damaged cells. Recent data indicate a role for decreased plasma gelsolin (pGSN) levels as a biomarker of inflammatory conditions. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), a heterogeneous group of cell-derived membranous structures involved in intercellular signaling, have been implicated in metabolic and inflammatory diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus. We examined whether pGSN levels were associated with EV concentration and inflammatory plasma proteins in individuals with or without diabetes.MethodsWe quantified pGSN longitudinally (n = 104) in a socioeconomically diverse cohort of middle-aged African American and White study participants with and without diabetes mellitus. Plasma gelsolin levels were assayed by ELISA. EV concentration (sub-cohort n = 40) was measured using nanoparticle tracking analysis. Inflammatory plasma proteins were assayed on the SomaScan (R) v4 proteomic platform.ResultspGSN levels were lower in men than women. White individuals with diabetes had significantly lower levels of pGSN compared to White individuals without diabetes and to African American individuals either with or without diabetes. For adults living below poverty, those with diabetes had lower pGSN levels than those without diabetes. Adults living above poverty had similar pGSN levels regardless of diabetes status. No correlation between EV concentrations and pGSN levels was identified (r = - 0.03; p = 0.85). Large-scale exploratory plasma protein proteomics revealed 47 proteins that significantly differed by diabetes status, 19 of which significantly correlated with pGSN levels, including adiponectin.ConclusionsIn this cohort of racially diverse individuals with and without diabetes, we found differences in pGSN levels with diabetes status, sex, race, and poverty. We also report significant associations of pGSN with the adipokine, adiponectin, and other inflammation- and diabetes-related proteins.

Metformin has been used as the first line of therapy in T2DM as it decreases hepatic glucose production and glucose intestinal absorption, enhances insulin sensitivity and weight loss, and is known to ameliorate inflammation. The mechanisms through which metformin exerts its effect remain unclear. Proteomics has emerged as a unique approach to explore the biological changes associated with diseases, including T2DM. It provides insight into the circulating biomarkers/mediators which could be utilized for disease screening, diagnosis, and prognosis. Methods: This study evaluated the proteomic changes in obese (Ob), obese diabetics (OD), and obese diabetic patients on metformin (ODM) using a 2D DIGE MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric approach. Results: Significant changes in sixteen plasma proteins (15 up and 1 down, ANOVA, p <= 0.05; fold change >= 1.5) were observed in the ODM group when compared to the Ob and OD groups. Bioinformatic network pathway analysis revealed that the majority of these altered plasma proteins are involved in distinct pathways involving acute-phase response, inflammation, and oxidative response and were centered around HNF4A, ERK, JNK, and insulin signaling pathways. Conclusions: Our study provides important information about the possible biomarkers altered by metformin treatment in obese patients with and without T2DM. These altered plasma proteins are involved in distinct pathways involving acute-phase response, inflammation, and oxidative response and were centered around HNF4A, ERK, JNK, and insulin signaling pathways.

A previous 28-day oral feeding study with rats revealed that the endogenous antioxidant protein DJ-1 was strongly deregulated at the protein level in kidney, liver, and testis of the experimental animals that had been treated either with 3-MCPD, 2-MCPD or their dipalmitate esters. Here we show that this deregulation is due to the oxidation of a conserved, redox-active cysteine residue (Cys106) of DJ-1 to a cysteine sulfonic acid which is equivalent to loss of function of DJ-1. Irreversible oxidation of DJ-1 is associated with a number of oxidative stress-related diseases such as Parkinson, cancer, and type II diabetes. It is assumed that 3-MCPD or 2-MCPD do not directly oxidize DJ-1, but that these substances induce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which in turn trigger DJ-1 oxidation. The implications of 3-MCPD/2-MCPD-mediated ROS formation in vivo for the ongoing risk assessment of these compounds as well as the potential of oxidized DJ-1 to serve as a novel effect biomarker for 3-MCPD/2-MCPD toxicity are being discussed.;;"Federal Institute for Risk Assessment; Leibniz Association; Leibniz Forschungsinstitut furr Molekulare Pharmakologie (FMP)";;;;;;;;;;23;27;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2018;92;1;;;;;289;299;;10.1007/s00204-017-2027-5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00204-017-2027-5;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000422913700017;View Full Record in Web of Science

Oxidative stress and inflammation related to hyperglycemia are interlinked and contribute to the occurrence of DKD. It was shown that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a novel yet already widely used therapy, may prevent the development of DKD and alter its natural progression. SGLT2 inhibitors induce systemic and glomerular hemodynamic changes, provide metabolic advantages, and reduce inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. In T2DM patients, regardless of cardiovascular diseases, SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce albuminuria, progression of DKD, and doubling of serum creatinine levels, thus lowering the need for kidney replacement therapy by over 40%.

The most routine method of assessing pancreatic beta-cell function is an oral glucose tolerance test, however this method is time consuming and carries a participant burden. The objectives of this research were to identify protein signatures and pathways related to pancreatic beta-cell function in fasting blood samples. Methods Beta-cell function measures were calculated for MECHE study participants who completed an oral glucose tolerance test and had proteomic data (n = 100). Information on 1,129 protein levels was obtained using the SOMAscan assay. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess discriminatory ability of proteins of interest. Subsequent in vitro experiments were performed using the BRIN-BD11 pancreatic beta-cell line. Replication of findings were achieved in a second human cohort where possible. Results Twenty-two proteins measured by aptamer technology were significantly associated with beta-cell function/HOMA-IR while 17 proteins were significantly associated with the disposition index (p <= 0.01). Receiver operator characteristic curves determined the protein panels to have excellent discrimination between low and high beta-cell function. Linear regression analysis determined that beta-endorphin and IL-17F have strong associations with beta-cell function/HOMA-IR, beta = 0.039 (p = 0.005) and beta = -0.027 (p = 0.013) respectively. Calcineurin and CRTAM were strongly associated with the disposition index (beta = 0.005 and beta = 0.005 respectively, p = 0.012). In vitro experiments confirmed that IL-17F modulated insulin secretion in the BRI N-BD1 1 cell line, with the lower concentration of 10 ng/mL significantly increasing glucose stimulated insulin secretion (p = 0.043).

This study investigated the efficacy of PostC in the leptin receptordeficient db/db mice, which possess Type 2 diabetic characteristics including obesity, hyperglycaemia and hyperleptinaemia. Adult male C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) and db/db mice were anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated and subjected to left coronary artery occlusion for 30 min. followed by 24 hrs of reperfusion. For the PostC groups, the hearts underwent six cycles of 10 sec. of reperfusion and 10 sec. of re-occlusion at the onset of reperfusion. The mice were sacrificed at the end of 24 hrs reperfusion for infarct size measurement. PostC significantly reduced infarct size in WT mice (n = 6/group; P < 0.05), but not in the db/db mice. To identify alterations in protein expression by PostC, proteomic analyses were performed in the heart samples using two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis with three CyDye labelling, followed by mass spectrometry. The results show that mitochondrial proteins (F1-ATPase ? and Echs1) were down-regulated by PostC in WT heart. Such change was absent in the db/db heart. On the other hand, PostC reduced Hsp20 in the diabetic heart. In summary, PostC fails to protect Type 2 diabetic mice against ischaemia-reperfusion injury.

The molecular mechanisms of metformin have not been fully identified, but turnover of biomarkers such as glucose and signalling pathways or translocation of glucose transporters are closely related to the glucose-lowering effects of metformin. The PK/PD of metformin have been investigated in healthy humans and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and modelling has been performed using an indirect response model. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS The purpose of this investigation was to develop a population PK/PD model for metformin using a signal transduction model in healthy humans and predict the PK/PD profile in patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim was to compare a previous model (a biophase model) with the signal transduction model, and use a more appropriate model to follow the actions of metformin. Additionally, our developed model was appropriate to predict the time course of plasma metformin and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes. To our knowledge, this is the first published population PK/PD analysis using the signal transduction model for metformin. AIMS To develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) model for metformin (500 mg) using the signal transduction model in healthy humans and to predict the PK/PD profile in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS Following the oral administration of 500 mg metformin to healthy humans, plasma concentrations of metformin were measured using LC-MS/MS. A sequential modelling approach using NONMEM VI was used to facilitate data analysis. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to predict the antihyperglycaemic effect in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS Forty-two healthy humans were included in the study. Population mean estimates (relative standard error, RSE) of apparent clearance, apparent volume of distribution and the absorption rate constant were 52.6 l h-1 (4.18%), 113 l (56.6%) and 0.41 h-1, respectively. Covariate analyses revealed that creatinine clearance (CLCR) significantly influenced metformin: CL/F= 52.6 x (CLcr/106.5)0.782. The signal transduction model was applied to describe the antihyperglycaemic effect of metformin. The population means for efficacy, potency, transit time and the Hill coefficient were estimated to be 19.8 (3.17%), 3.68 mu g ml-1 (3.89%), 0.5 h (2.89%) and 0.547 (9.05%), respectively. The developed model was used to predict the antihyperglycaemic effect in patients with type 2 diabetes. The predicted plasma glucose concentration value was similar to previous values. CONCLUSIONS The population signal transduction model was developed and evaluated for metformin use in healthy volunteers. Model evaluation by non-parametric bootstrap analysis suggested that the proposed model was robust and parameter values were estimated with good precision.;;Chungnam National University;;;;;;;;;;12;16;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2012;74;5;;;;;815;823;;10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04260.x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04260.x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000309597200011;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aims to develop a novel system of multidimensional network biomarkers (MDNBs) based on a widely targeted metabolomics approach to detect DR among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) efficiently. Research design and methods In this propensity score matching-based case-control study, we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry system for serum metabolites assessment of 69 pairs of patients with T2DM with DR (cases) and without DR (controls). Comprehensive analysis, including principal component analysis, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, generalized linear regression models and a 1000-times permutation test on metabolomics characteristics were conducted to detect candidate MDNBs depending on the discovery set. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was applied for the validation of capability and feasibility of MDNBs based on a separate validation set. Results We detected 613 features (318 in positive and 295 in negative ESI modes) in which 63 metabolites were highly relevant to the presence of DR. A panel of MDNBs containing linoleic acid, nicotinuric acid, ornithine and phenylacetylglutamine was determined based on the discovery set. Depending on the separate validation set, the area under the curve (95% CI), sensitivity and specificity of this MDNBs system were 0.92 (0.84 to 1.0), 96% and 78%, respectively. Conclusions This study demonstrates that metabolomics-based MDNBs are associated with the presence of DR and capable of distinguishing DR from T2DM efficiently. Our data also provide new insights into the mechanisms of DR and the potential value for new treatment targets development. Additional studies are needed to confirm our findings.;;"Wenzhou Medical University; Wenzhou Medical University; Wenzhou Medical University; Anhui Medical University; University of Macau; Wenzhou Medical University; Wenzhou Medical University; China Agricultural University; Zhejiang University";;;;;;;;;;29;30;;;;;;;;;;;;2021;9;1;;;;;;;e001443;10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001443;http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001443;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000621085300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive cancer and this study aimed at a comprehensive characterization of hepatic and serum lipids in human HCC. Cholesteryl ester were higher in tumorous tissues (TT) compared to adjacent non-tumorous tissues (NT). Free cholesterol exerting cytotoxic effects was not changed. Phosphatidylethanolamine, -serine (PS) and -inositol but not phosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) were reduced in HCC tissues. Saturated species mostly increased and polyunsaturated species were diminished in all of these phospholipids. Ceramide (Cer) was markedly reduced in HCC tissues and higher levels of sphingomyelin suggest impaired sphingomyelinase activity as one of the underlying mechanisms. Importantly, ceramide in NT increased in HCC stage T3. Ceramide released from hepatocytes attracts immune cells and a positive association of the macrophage specific receptor CD163 with NT ceramide was identified. HCC associated lipid changes did not differ in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes. Protein levels of p53 were induced in TT and negatively correlated with Cer d18:1/16:0 and PS 36:1. Of the lipid species changed in HCC tissues only TT Cer d18:1/16:0, Cer d18:1/24:1, PC 38:6 and LPC 22:6 correlated with the respective serum levels. Our study demonstrates a considerably altered hepatic lipidome in HCC tissues. Ceramide was markedly reduced in HCC tissues, and therefore, raising ceramide levels specifically in the tumor represents a reasonable therapeutic approach for the treatment of this malignancy.

The current markers of diabetic nephropathy are based on albuminuria and clinical signs of retinopathy. Sensitive and specific noninvasive diagnostic tools, unbiased by the presence of comorbidities, are needed, especially to detect the early stages of diabetic complications. OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to analyze changes in urinary protein excretion based on the stage of DKD using quantitative proteomics. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 27 healthy controls were age-and sex-matched to 72 diabetes patients classified into 3 groups: no signs of retinopathy or nephropathy (n = 33), retinopathy but no microalbuminuria (n = 15), and diabetic nephropathy (DN) based on overt albuminuria or microalbuminuria with retinopathy (n = 24). To assess the intergroup differences, samples were partially pooled, tagged using 8-plex iTRAQ reagents, and the resulting peptide mixture was resolved by isoelectrofocusing. The obtained fractions were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Data were analyzed using the MASCOT software and dedicated in-house proteomic data analysis programs. RESULTS The changes in the urine proteome following DKD progression involved some known protein markers of DN and several other proteins. Decreased levels of some proteins are presumably related to impaired secretory function of other organs affected by diabetes. In particular, a diminished excretion of pancreatic amylase and deoxyribonuclease I suggested exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), coexisting with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS A decrease in the urinary excretion of some pancreatic enzymes suggests EPI associated with diabetes. This hypothesis is yet to be verified; nevertheless, renal and extrarenal confounders must be considered when interpreting the results of quantitative urinary proteomics.";;"Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Biochemistry & Biophysics - Polish Academy of Sciences; University of Warsaw";;;;;;;;;;18;19;;;;;;;;;;;;2015;125;1-2;;;;;27;+;;10.20452/pamw.2640;http://dx.doi.org/10.20452/pamw.2640;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000350148200004;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, a urinary metabonomics method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed to study the effect mechanism of mitiglinide on type 2 diabetes mellitus. With pattern recognition analysis of urinary metabolite profiles, a clear separation between Streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic rats and those treated with mitiglinide was achieved. Some significantly changed metabolites like citrate, creatinine, phenylalanine and bile acids (cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid) have been identified and used to explain the mechanism. This work shows that metabonomics method is a valuable tool in drug mechanism study. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Yet only half of obese adolescents have IR and far fewer progress to type 2 diabetes mellitus. We hypothesized that amino acid and fatty acid metabolites may serve as biomarkers or determinants of IR in obese teens. Research Design and Methods: Fasting blood samples were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry in 82 obese adolescents. A principal components analysis and multiple linear regression models were used to correlate metabolic components with surrogate measures of IR: homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), adiponectin, and triglyceride (TG) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio. Results: Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) levels and products of BCAA catabolism were higher (P <.01) in males than females with comparable body mass index (BMI) z-score. In multivariate analyses, HOMA-IR in males correlated positively with BMI z-score and a metabolic signature containing BCAA, uric acid, and long-chain acylcarnitines and negatively with byproducts of complete fatty acid oxidation (R-2 = 0.659, P <.0001). In contrast, only BMI z-score correlated with HOMA-IR in females. Adiponectin correlated inversely with BCAA and uric acid (R-2 = 0.268, P =.0212) in males but not females. TG to HDL ratio correlated with BMI z-score and the BCAA signature in females but not males. Conclusions: BCAA levels and byproducts of BCAA catabolism are higher in obese teenage boys than girls of comparable BMI z-score. A metabolic signature comprising BCAA and uric acid correlates positively with HOMA-IR in males and TG to HDL ratio in females and inversely with adiponectin in males but not females. Likewise, byproducts of fatty acid oxidation associate inversely with HOMA-IR in males but not females.

In 2019, The UAE diabetes national prevalence was 15.4%. In recent years there has been a considerable investigation of predictive biomarkers associated with these conditions. This study analysed fasting (8 h) blood samples from an obese, normoglycemic cohort and an obese, T2DM cohort of UAE nationals, employing clinical chemistry analysis, 1D H-1 NMR and mass spectroscopy (FIA-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS) techniques. The novel findings reported for the first time in a UAE population revealed significant differences in a number of metabolites in the T2DM cohort. Metabolic fingerprints identified by NMR included BCAAs, trimethylamine N-oxide, beta -hydroxybutyrate, trimethyl uric acid, and alanine. A targeted MS approach showed significant differences in lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, acylcarnitine, amino acids and sphingomyelins; Lyso.PC.a.C18.0, PC.ae.C34.2, C3.DC..C4.OH, glutamine and SM.C16.1, being the most significant metabolites. Pearson's correlation studies showed associations between these metabolites and the clinical chemistry parameters across both cohorts.

Here, we investigated the applicability of an O-18-labeling technique for the development of a standard-free, label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Rather than attempting to identify quantitative differences in proteins as biomarkers, glycation of the highest abundance protein in human plasma, human serum albumin (HSA), was monitored through quantitative analysis of HSA characteristic peptides using the O-18-labeling technique. Eight glucose-sensitive peptides and one glucose-insensitive peptide were discovered. The glucose-insensitive peptide served as the internal standard, and a standard-free, label-free LC-MS/MS method was developed. This method was then used to select putative biomarkers for T2DM in a clinical trial with 389 human plasma samples. As a result, three of the eight glucose-sensitive peptides (FKDLGEENFK, LDELRDEGK, and KVPQVSTPTLVEVSR) were selected and could be used as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of T2DM.;;Beijing Institute of Technology;;;;;;;;;;35;42;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2013;62;11;;;;;3936;3942;;10.2337/db13-0347;http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db13-0347;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000326290700037;View Full Record in Web of Science

Human myotubes are primary skeletal muscle cells displaying both morphological and biochemical characteristics of mature skeletal muscle and the diabetic phenotype is conserved in myotubes derived from subjects with type 2 diabetes. Several abnormalities have been identified in skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetic subjects, however, the exact molecular mechanisms leading to the diabetic phenotype has still not been found. Here we present a large-scale study in which we combine a quantitative proteomic discovery strategy using isobaric peptide tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and a label-free study with a targeted quantitative proteomic approach using selected reaction monitoring to identify, quantify, and validate changes in protein abundance among human myotubes obtained from nondiabetic lean, nondiabetic obese, and type 2 diabetic subjects, respectively. Using an optimized protein precipitation protocol, a total of 2832 unique proteins were identified and quantified using the iTRAQ strategy. Despite a clear diabetic phenotype in diabetic myotubes, the majority of the proteins identified in this study did not exhibit significant abundance changes across the patient groups. Proteins from all major pathways known to be important in type 2 diabetic subjects were well-characterized in this study. This included pathways like the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) cycle, lipid oxidation, oxidative phosphorylation, the glycolytic pathway, and glycogen metabolism from which all but two enzymes were found in the present study. None of these enzymes were found to be regulated at the level of protein expression or degradation supporting the hypothesis that these pathways are regulated at the level of post-translational modification. Twelve proteins were, however, differentially expressed among the three different groups. Thirty-six proteins were chosen for further analysis and validation using selected reaction monitoring based on the regulation identified in the iTRAQ discovery study. The abundance of adenosine deaminase was considerably down-regulated in diabetic myotubes and as the protein binds propyl dipeptidase (DPP-IV), we speculate whether the reduced binding of adenosine deaminase to DPP-IV may contribute to the diabetic phenotype in vivo by leading to a higher level of free DPP-IV to bind and inactivate the anti-diabetic hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulintropic polypeptide.

Nevertheless, comprehensive re-searches on its role have not been performed. We here conducted an integrated analysis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) metabolism of fads2-deletion zebrafish (fads2(-/-)) by transcriptomics, proteomics and phosphoproteomics. Compared with wild type zebrafish (WT), fads2(-/-) showed significantly higher contents of hepatic linoleic acid (all-cis-9,12-C18:2), alpha-linolenic acid (all-cis-9,12,15-C18:3) and docosapetaenoic acid (all-cis-7,10,13,16,19-C22:5), and lower contents of gamma-linolenic acid (all-cis-6,9,12-C18:3), stearidonic acid (all-cis-6,9,12,15-C18:4) and docosahexaenoic acid (all-cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-C22:6), accompanied by an increased n-6/n-3 PUFA level. In total, we identified 1608 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 209 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and 153 differentially expressed phosphorylated proteins (DEPPs) with 190 sites between fads2-/- and WT. Transcriptome and proteome analysis simultaneously aggregated these DEGs and DEPs into LC-PUFA synthesis and PPAR signaling pathways. Further interaction network analysis of the DEPPs showed that spliceosome and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway were critical groups. Additionally, we determined seven highly phosphorylated kinases and a highly expressed phosphatase in fads2-/- zebrafish. These results give insights into the mechanism by which fads2 affects metabolic disease occurrence, and provide datasets for target selections for human disease treatment. Significance: Balanced LC-PUFA composition was deeply associated with body health, while changes of LCPUFAs usually induced serious diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and inflammatory disease. Fatty acid desaturase 2 (Fads2), subordinating to the fatty acid desaturase protein family, catalyzes the first desaturation reaction in LC-PUFA synthesis. Although Fads2 is associated with many chronic diseases including metabolic abnormalities, type 2 diabetes and obesity, comprehensive researches on its role have not been performed. On the basis of the integrated transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome analysis, we identified that fads2 was critical for maintaining body LC-PUFA homeostasis. Moreover, the crucial pathways including PPAR signaling pathway, spliceosome and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway, and candidate kinase targets associated with LC-PUFA metabolism were determined. These findings will contribute to the revealing of the mechanism and supply possible datasets for target selection for human disease treatment.;;"Huazhong Agricultural University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Huazhong Agricultural University";;;;;;;;;;15;18;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 30;2020;229;;;;;;;;103967;10.1016/j.jprot.2020.103967;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2020.103967;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000579106800008;View Full Record in Web of Science

Because EVs can be transported to recipient cells via circulation, many researchers have been studying EVs from immune cells or cancer cells. Adipocytes are also considered endocrine cells and secrete adipokines such as adiponectin, regulating a variety of intracellular signaling pathways. Expansion of adipose tissue in obesity alters adipokine secretion, thereby increasing the risk of metabolic diseases. Characterization of adipocyte-derived exosomes is necessary to explain the communication between adipocytes and other cell types. In the present study, to identify proteins associated with adipocyte-derived exosomes, we isolated exosomes from adipose tissue of obese diabetic and obese nondiabetic rats. We identified proteins by analyzing exosomes from obese rats with type 2 diabetes and their matched control littermates using nano-liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry coupled with label-free relative quantification. We identified 509 proteins from adipocytes including 81 known adipokines; similar to 78 % of all the identified proteins were categorized as exosome-associated proteins. Among the protein profiles, we uncovered 128 upregulated and 72 downregulated proteins, which are differentially expressed in OLETF adipocyte-derived exosomes.

This study attempted to identify potential biomarkers by detecting changes in the levels of plasma proteins in T2DM patients following onset of AMI in comparison with those without AMI. Volunteer T2DM patients without AMI (control; n=10) and T2DM patients with AMI (n=10) were recruited. Plasma samples from these patients were evaluated via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) to screen for proteins with level changes between the two groups. The abundance of spots on gel images was analyzed using Progenesis SameSpots and subjected to false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. Protein spots with statistically significant changes of at least 1.5 fold were selected for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Due to strong cardiac connections, tetranectin and titin were evaluated by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The adjusted P-values and fold changes between the two groups resulted in identification of 34 protein spots with significantly altered abundance. Upon MS analysis, 17 plasma proteins were identified: tetranectin, titin, clusterin, haptoglobin, myosin-13, zinc fnger protein 445, DNA repair protein RAD50, serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-IV, caspase-6, aminoacyl tRNA synthase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1, serotransferrin, retinol-binding protein 4, transthyretin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein A-I and serum amyloid A. Comparable patterns of changes in tetranectin and titin between the control and AMI groups were confirmed using ELISA. In summary, tetranectin and titin in plasma appeared to be closely associated with the onset of AMI among T2DM patients and can be used as potential biomarkers for prediction of a cardiac event, though this requires validation in a prospective cohort study.";;"Universiti Teknologi MARA; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya";;;;;;;;;;16;17;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2018;39;7;;;;;1197;1207;;10.1038/aps.2017.141;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/aps.2017.141;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000438943200014;View Full Record in Web of Science

We hypothesize that the systemic metabolic and proteomic derangement observed in the progression of diabetes influences the composition of the aqueous humor (AH), which ultimately impacts the anterior segment health of the eye. To identify changes associated with diabetes progression, we mapped the metabolite profile and proteome of AH samples from patients with varying severities of type II diabetes (T2DM). Patients were classified as nondiabetic (ND or control), non-insulin-dependent diabetic without advanced features of disease (NAD-ni), insulin-dependent diabetic without advanced features (NAD-i), or diabetic with advanced features (AD). AH samples collected from the anterior chamber during elective ophthalmic surgery were evaluated for metabolite and protein expression changes associated with diabetic severity via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. Metabolic and proteomic pathway analyses were conducted utilizing MetaboAnalyst 4.0 and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. A total of 14 control, 12 NAD-ni, 4 NAD-I, and 14 AD samples were included for analysis. Elevated levels of several branched amino acids (e.g., valine, leucine, isoleucine), and lipid metabolites (e.g., palmitate) were found only with increasing diabetic severity (i.e., the AD group). Similar proteomic trends were noted in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism and the unfolded protein/stress response. These results represent the first report of both metabolomic and proteomic evaluation of aqueous humor. Diabetes results in metabolic and proteomic perturbations detectable in the AH, and unique changes become manifest as T2DM severity worsens. Changes in AH composition may serve as an indicator of disease severity, risk assessment of anterior segment cells and structures, and potential future therapies.;;"University of Iowa; University of Iowa; University of Iowa; University of Iowa";;;;;;;;;;7;7;;;;;;;;;;;JAN 18;2023;18;1;;;;;;;e0280491;10.1371/journal.pone.0280491;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0280491;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000945493900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The NHS allocates 10 pound billion (9% of its budget) to manage diabetes. Metformin is the primary treatment for T2DM, but 35% of patients don't benefit from it, leading to complications. This study aims to delve into metformin's efficacy using clinical, genomic, and proteomic data to uncover new biomarkers and build a Machine Learning predictor for early metformin response detection. Methods: Here we report analysis from a T2DM dataset of individuals prescribed metformin monotherapy from the Diastrat cohort recruited at the Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Northern Ireland. Results: In the clinical data analysis, comparing responders (those achieving HbA1c <= 48 mmol/mol) to non-responders (with HbA1c > 48 mmol/mol), we identified that creatinine levels and bodyweight were more negatively correlated with response than non-response. In genomic analysis, we identified statistically significant (p-value <0.05) variants rs6551649 (LPHN3), rs6551654 (LPHN3), rs4495065 (LPHN3) and rs7940817 (TRPC6) which appear to differentiate the responders and non-responders. In proteomic analysis, we identified 15 statistically significant (p-value <0.05, q-value <0.05) proteomic markers that differentiate controls, responders, non-responders and treatment groups, out of which the most significant were HAOX1, CCL17 and PAI that had fold change similar to 2.

New insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetic renal disease may emerge from recent advances in proteomics using high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS) of urine. Methods. Using a combination of online capillary electrophoresis (CE) and MS we evaluated urinary polypeptide patterns in four groups of type 2 diabetic patients matched for age, gender, and diabetes duration, including 20 normoalbuminuric patients with and 20 without diabetic retinopathy, 20 microalbuminuric patients with diabetic retinopathy, and 18 macroalbuminuric patients with diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, changes in urinary polypeptide patterns during treatment with the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) candesartan were evaluated in the macroalbuminuric patients in a randomized double-blinded, cross-over trial where each patient received treatment with placebo, candesartan 8, 16, and 32 mg daily each for 2 months. Results. Overall, 4551 different polypeptides were found in the samples. Urinary polypeptide patterns were comparable in normo- (with and without diabetic retinopathy) and microalbuminuric patients, whereas distinct differences were found in macroalbuminuric patients. Differences in urinary polypeptide patterns between normo- and macroalbuminuric patients permitted the establishment of a diabetic renal damage pattern consisting of 113 polypeptides. Eleven of these polypeptides had been sequenced and identified. Candesartan treatment in macroalbuminuric patients significantly changed 15 of the 113 polypeptides in the diabetic renal damage pattern toward levels in normoalbuminuric patients. Change in the diabetic renal damage pattern was not candesartan dose-dependent but individual changes correlated with changes in urinary albumin excretion at each dose level. Conclusion. CE-MS serves as a fast and sensitive tool for identification of biomarkers and urinary polypeptide patterns specific for macroalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients and may be used to explore and monitor renoprotective effects of ARB.;;"Steno Diabetes Center; Hannover Medical School; Aarhus University";;;;;;;;;;113;126;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2005;68;1;;;;;193;205;;10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.00394.x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.00394.x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000229636800019;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this context, our study presents a proteomic analysis of post-exercise skeletal muscle biopsies from individuals across a spectrum of glucose metabolism states: normal, prediabetes, and T2D. This enabled the identification of significant protein relationships indicative of each specific glycemic condition. Our investigation primarily leveraged the machine learning approach, employing the white-box algorithm relative evolutionary hierarchical analysis (REHA), to explore the impact of regulated, mixed mode exercise on skeletal muscle proteome in subjects with diverse glycemic status. This method aimed to advance the diagnosis of IR and T2D and elucidate the molecular pathways involved in its development and the response to exercise. Additionally, we used proteomics-specific statistical analysis to provide a comparative perspective, highlighting the nuanced differences identified by REHA. Validation of the REHA model with a comparable external dataset further demonstrated its efficacy in distinguishing between diverse proteomic profiles. Key metrics such as accuracy and the area under the ROC curve confirmed REHA's capability to uncover novel molecular pathways and significant protein interactions, offering fresh insights into the effects of exercise on IR and T2D pathophysiology of skeletal muscle. The visualizations not only underscored significant proteins and their interactions but also showcased decision trees that effectively differentiate between various glycemic states, thereby enhancing our understanding of the biomolecular landscape of T2D.;;"Medical University of Bialystok; Medical University of Bialystok; Bialystok University of Technology; Medical University of Bialystok; Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Broad Institute";;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;JUL 31;2024;14;1;;;;;;;17631;10.1038/s41598-024-68568-4;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-68568-4;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001283344000058;View Full Record in Web of Science

Urinary protein biomarkers may be used to monitor or predict patient status. Urine samples were selected from patients enrolled in the retrospective diabetic kidney disease (DKD) study, including 35 with good and 19 with poor prognosis. After removal of albumin and immunoglobulin, the remaining proteins were reduced, alkylated, digested, and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively with a nano LC-MS platform. Each protein was identified, and its concentration normalized to that of creatinine. A prognostic model of DKD was formulated based on the adjusted quantities of each protein in the two groups. Of 1296 proteins identified in the 54 urine samples, 66 were differentially abundant in the two groups (area under the curve (AUC):p-value < 0.05), but none showed significantly better performance than albumin. To improve the predictive power by multivariate analysis, five proteins (ACP2, CTSA, GM2A, MUC1, and SPARCL1) were selected as significant by an AUC-based random forest method. The application of two classifiers-support vector machine and random forest-showed that the multivariate model performed better than univariate analysis of mucin-1 (AUC: 0.935 vs. 0.791) and albumin (AUC: 1.0 vs. 0.722). The urinary proteome can reflect kidney function directly and can predict the prognosis of patients with chronic kidney dysfunction.

Free fatty acids (FFAs) are believed to play important roles in the occurrence of cardiovascular disease in people with T2DM. The aim of this study was to investigate the fingerprint of plasma FFAs and their correlations with the tradition risk factors of cardiovascular disease in T2DM patients complicated by coronary heart disease (CHD-T2DM). A total of 401 participants, including healthy control (HC, n = 143), T2DM patients (n = 134), and CHD-T2DM patients (n = 126) were enrolled in this study. Plasma levels of 36 FFAs with carbon chain length ranged from 3 to 22 were quantified by using reverse phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Tradition risk factors of cardiovascular disease were tested in clinical laboratory, including homocysteine (HCY), creatine kinase (CK), high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and so on. Almost all the FFAs with different carbon chain length and unsaturation were significantly upregulated in the T2DM-CHD groups, compared to the HC and T2DM groups. Both n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were also found to be significantly upregulated in T2DM-CHD group compared to the T2DM group. However, no significantly differences of the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, arachidonic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid (AA/EPA) ratio, and arachidonic acid/docosahexaenoic acid (AA/DHA) ratio were observed between T2DM-CHD and T2DM groups. Plasma FFA levels were found to be positively correlated with HCY, CK, hsCRP, NT-proBNP and other tradition risk factors of CHD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that a dozens of FFAs were the independent risk factors of CHD after adjustment for confounding factors and other risk factors. Excessively high plasma levels of FFAs were demonstrated to be independent risk factors for CHD in patients with T2DM, despite of the differences in chain length, unsaturation, and double bond position.;;Capital Medical University;;;;;;;;;;10;12;;;;;;;;;;;JUL 22;2022;9;;;;;;;;903412;10.3389/fcvm.2022.903412;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2022.903412;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000837128800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Their effects on L-arginine (Arg) related risk markers asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA and SDMA) and the protective biomarker L-homoarginine (hArg) linking T2D to cardiovascular and renal disease have not yet been reported. Methods: Plasma and 24-h urine samples taken before and after 6 weeks of treatment were available from two prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trials with empagliflozin (71 patients analyzed, NCT02471963) and dapagliflozin (59 patients analyzed, NCT02383238). In these samples, concentrations of hArg, Arg, ADMA, SDMA, and creatinine were determined by liquid-chromatography coupled to tandem mass-spectrometry. Additionally, intraindividual changes of the biomarkers in plasma were correlated with intraindividual changes of clinical parameters. Results: Treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin was associated with a reduction of plasma hArg by 17.5% and 13.7% (both p <0.001), respectively, and increase in plasma SDMA concentration of 6.7% and 3.6%, respectively (p <0.001 and p <0.05), while plasma Arg and ADMA concentrations were not significantly altered. 24-h urinary excretion of ADMA was reduced by 15.2% after treatment with empagliflozin (p <0.001) but not after dapagliflozin treatment, while excretion of the other markers was not significantly altered. Renal clearance of SDMA was reduced by 9.1% and 3.9% for both drugs (both p <0.05). A reduction in ADMA clearance was observable after empagliflozin treatment only (- 15.5%, p <0.001), but not after dapagliflozin. Renal clearance of hArg and Arg was not significantly altered. Treatment effects on L-arginine related biomarkers were not constantly correlated with effects on glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure. Conclusions: Treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors has divergent effects on Arg-related biomarkers and could affect risk estimates associated with these markers. The observed effects are unlikely to explain the known cardiovascular and renal benefits of treatment with empagliflozin or dapagliflozin but still may indicate new therapeutic approaches in patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors.;;"University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Bonn";;;;;;;;;;5;5;;;;;;;;;;;JAN 6;2022;21;1;;;;;;;4;10.1186/s12933-021-01436-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12933-021-01436-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000739960000002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Supervised orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis and differential metabolite screening with fold change (FC) were performed to identify distinct biomarkers. The diagnostic performance of KP metabolites in T2DM was evaluated. Results: Significant decreases of TRP, 5HT, KA, XA, and KA/KYN and increases of KYN/TRP and NEO in T2DM compared to HC group were observed (P < 0.05).

It is possible that novel markers portraying the pathophysiological underpinning processes may be useful. Aim: To investigate the associations between 80 circulating proteins, measured by a proximity extension assay, and prevalent DKD and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in type 2 diabetes. Methods: We randomly divided individuals with type 2 diabetes from three cohorts into a two-thirds discovery and one-third replication set (total n = 813, of whom 231 had DKD defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mg/mL/1.73 m(2) and/or urinary albumin-creatinine ratio >= 3 g/mol). Proteins associated with DKD were also assessed as predictors for incident major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in persons with DKD at baseline. Results: Four proteins were positively associated with DKD in models adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, glucose control, and diabetes medication: kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1, odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation increment, 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-2.14); growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15, OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.16-1.69); myoglobin (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.30-1.91), and matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP-10, OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.17-1.74). In patients with DKD, GDF-15 was significantly associated with increased risk of MACE after adjustments for baseline age, sex, microalbuminuria, and kidney function and (59 MACE events during 7 years follow-up, hazard ratio per standard deviation increase 1.43 [95% CI 1.03-1.98]) but not after further adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusion: Our proteomics approach confirms and extends previous associations of higher circulating levels of GDF-15 with both micro- and macrovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.

It often leads to undiagnosed complications and commonly coexists with other health conditions. This study investigates two types of prevalent comorbidities related to T2DM-the circulatory system (DCM1) and digestive system diseases (DCM2)-using clinical, genomic and proteomic datasets. The aim is to identify new biomarkers by applying existing machine learning (ML) based techniques for early detection, prognosis and diagnosis of these comorbidities.MethodsHere, we report a cross-sectional retrospective analysis from a T2DM dataset of T2DM associated concordant comorbidities (diseases with shared pathophysiology and management) from the Diastrat cohort (a T2DM cohort) recruited at the Northern Ireland Centre for Stratified Medicine (NICSM), in Northern Ireland.ResultsIn the clinical data analysis, we identified that lipidemia was shown to negatively correlate with depression in the DCM1 group while positively correlate with depression in the DCM2 group. In genomic analysis, we identified statistically significant variants rs9844730 in procollagen-lysine (PLOD2), rs73590361 in beta-1,4-N-acetyl- galactosaminyl-transferase (B4GALNT3) and rs964680 in A kinase (PRKA) anchor protein 14 (AKAP14) which appear to differentiate DCM1 and DCM2 groups. In proteomic analysis, we identified 4 statistically significant proteins: natriuretic peptides B (BNP), pro-adrenomedullin (ADM), natriuretic peptides B (NT-proBNP) and discoidin (DCBLD2) that can differentiate DCM1 and DCM2 groups and have built robust ML model using clinical, genomic, and proteomic markers (0.83 receiver operative characteristics curve area, 84% positive predictive value and 83% negative predictive value and a classification accuracy of 83%) for prediction of DCM1 and DCM2 groups.ConclusionOur study successfully identifies novel clinical, genomic, and proteomic biomarkers that differentiate between circulatory and digestive system comorbidities in Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus patients. The machine learning model we developed demonstrates strong predictive capabilities, providing a promising tool for the early detection, prognosis, and diagnosis of these T2DM-associated comorbidities. These findings have the potential to enhance personalized management strategies for patients with T2DM, ultimately improving clinical outcomes.

To identify novel biomarkers of normal aging, we analyzed plasma proteins of male mice longitudinally from 2 to 19 months of age. Plasma proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified using mass spectrometry (MS), MS/MS and liquid chromatography MS/MS. We found that many plasma proteins exist as multiple isoforms with different masses and/or charges. Thirty-nine protein spots (corresponding to six distinct proteins) have been identified, 13 of which exhibited significant changes with age. For example, several proteins increased significantly during aging including one isoform of transthyretin, two isoforms of haptoglobin, and three isoforms of immunoglobulin kappa chain. Conversely, several proteins decreased significantly during aging including peroxiredoxin-2, serum amyloid protein A-1, and five isoforms of albumin. Identification of these proteins provides new biomarkers of normal aging in mice. If validated in humans, these biomarkers may facilitate therapeutic interventions to identify premature aging, delay aging, and/or improve healthspan of the elderly.;;"University System of Ohio; Ohio University; University System of Ohio; Ohio University";;;;;;;;;;27;29;;;;;;;;;;;SEP;2011;33;3;;;;;291;307;;10.1007/s11357-010-9179-z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11357-010-9179-z;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000294676400005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Abnormal lipid metabolism was demonstrated to be greatly implicated in many human lifestyle-related diseases. In this review, we focused on lipidomic applications in brain injury disease, cancer, metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and infectious disease to discover disease biomarkers and illustrate biochemical metabolic pathways. We also discussed the analytical techniques, future perspectives and potential problems of lipidomic applications.

A new urinary peptide classifier (CKD273) has exhibited greater ability to detect CKD progression, however, its cost-effectiveness remains unknown. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of screening for CKD progression with the CKD273 classifier, as compared to UAE, in diabetic patients. A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to estimate costs and health outcomes [including overall survival and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] from a health system perspective for adopting a new annual screening strategy based on the CKD273 classifier as compared to annual UAE-based screening in a hypothetical cohort of T2DM patients. High-risk patients were defined as T2DM patients with at least one concomitant risk factor (i.e. patients with background genetic risk for developing the disease, obesity, hypertension and/or smoking history) for developing diabetic nephropathy secondary to cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related complications. Low-risk T2DM patients, were defined as those not having any of the aforementioned concomitant risk factors. Over the projected course of a patient's lifetime, in all T2DM patients annual screening with the CKD273 classifier was more costly, but also more effective, than annual screening with UAE. The incremental costs incurred with screening based on the CKD273 classifier were a,notsign3,053 per patient, while patients gained 0.13 QALYs. Hence, in all patients, annual screening with the CKD273 classifier was cost effective [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) a,notsign23,903/QALY gained], notably below current government thresholds for funding such health care interventions. For patients at high risk of developing diabetic nephropathy secondary to CVD-related complications, screening based on the CKD273 classifier was cost-saving (i.e. dominant, being both more effective and less expensive than UAE-based screening). Finally, in low-risk patients, CKD273 classifier-based screening was not cost effective (ICER a,notsign73,140/QALY) given current government willingness-to-pay thresholds. In diabetic patients, annual CKD273 classifier-based screening is more costly but also more effective in QALYs gained as compared to UAE. From a health provider perspective, the observed benefits are greatest when such screening is implemented in patients at high risk for diabetes-associated renal or cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).;;"Academy of Athens; University of Amsterdam; Academic Medical Center Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Sydney";;;;;;;;;;33;33;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2018;33;3;;;;;441;449;;10.1093/ndt/gfx068;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfx068;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000426868500014;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it remains unclear whether the therapeutic effect of metformin in T2DM is related to the modulation of TRP metabolic pathway. This study aims to investigate whether metformin affects TRP metabolism in T2DM mice through the gut microbiota. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was established to determine 16 TRP metabolites in the serum, colon content, urine, and feces of T2DM mice, and the correlations between metabolites and the T2DM mice gut microbiota were performed. The method demonstrated acceptable linearity (R-2 > 0.996), with the limit of quantification ranging from 0.29 to 69.444 nmol/L for 16 analytes, and the limit of detection ranging from 0.087 to 20.833 nmol/L. In T2DM mice, metformin treatment effectively restored levels of indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), and the ILA/IPA ratio, along with several aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands in the serum, with a notable impact in the colon but not in the urine. This restoration was accompanied by a shift in the relative abundance of Dubosiella, Turicibacter, RF39, Clostridia_UCG-014, and Alistipes. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed positive correlations between Turicibacter and Alistipes with IPA and indole-3-acetic acid. Conversely, these genera displayed negative correlations with ILA and kynurenine. In addition, our study revealed the presence of endogenous indole pathway in germ-free mice, and the impact of metformin on endogenous TRP metabolism in T2DM mice cannot be disregarded. Further research is needed to investigate the regulation of TRP metabolism by metformin.;;"Shanxi Agricultural University; Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Animal Science, CAAS";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 3;2024;12;10;;;;;;;;10.1128/spectrum.00291-24;http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00291-24;;AUG 2024;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001294502800025;View Full Record in Web of Science

Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these chronic conditions is of relevant importance as it might lead to the identification of novel anti-obesity targets. The purpose of the current study is to investigate differentially expressed proteins between lean and obese subjects through a shot-gun quantitative proteomics approach using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) extracts as well as potential modulation of those proteins by physical exercise. Using this approach, a total of 47 proteins showed at least 1.5 fold change between lean and obese subjects. In obese, the proteomic profiling before and after 3 months of physical exercise showed differential expression of 38 proteins. Thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) was among the proteins that were upregulated in obese subjects and then decreased by physical exercise. Conversely, the histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) was downregulated in obese subjects and then induced by physical exercise. The proteomic data was further validated by qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry in both PBMCs and adipose tissue. We also showed that HDAC4 levels correlated positively with maximum oxygen consumption (V-O2 (Max)) but negatively with body mass index, percent body fat, and the inflammatory chemokine RANTES. In functional assays, our data indicated that ectopic expression of HDAC4 significantly impaired TNF-alpha-dependent activation of NF-kappa B, establishing thus a link between HDAC4 and regulation of the immune system. Together, the expression pattern of HDAC4 in obese subjects before and after physical exercise, its correlation with various physical, clinical and metabolic parameters along with its inhibitory effect on NF-kappa B are suggestive of a protective role of HDAC4 against obesity. HDAC4 could therefore represent a potential therapeutic target for the control and management of obesity and presumably insulin resistance.";;"Dasman Diabetes Institute (DDI); Dasman Diabetes Institute (DDI); Dasman Diabetes Institute (DDI); Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar; Qatar Biomedical Research Institute (QBRI)";;;;;;;;;;72;79;;;;;;;;;;;SEP 24;2013;8;9;;;;;;;e75342;10.1371/journal.pone.0075342;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0075342;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000325025200040;View Full Record in Web of Science

While extensive research has been conducted on adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for promoting wound healing, there is a scarcity of studies focusing on diabetic wounds, particularly those employing proteomics and bioinformatics approaches. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which ADSCs promote diabetic wound healing using proteomics and bioinformatics techniques. Methods: Healthy rat fat tissue was used to isolate ADSCs. A T2DM rat model with back wounds was established. The experimental group received ADSC injections around the wound, while the control group received PBS injections. Wound healing rates were documented and photographed on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14. On day 7, wound tissues were excised for HE and Masson's staining. Additionally, on day 7, tissues were analyzed for protein quantification using 4D-DIA, with subsequent GO and KEGG analyses for differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using STRING database (String v11.5). Finally, Western blot experiments were performed on day 7 wounds to verify target proteins. Results and Conclusions: In all measured days postoperatively, the wound healing rate was significantly higher in the ADSC group than in the PBS group (day 7: p < 0.001, day 10: p = 0.001, day 14: p < 0.01), except on day 3 (p > 0.05). Proteomic analysis identified 474 differentially expressed proteins, with 224 key proteins after PPI analysis (78 upregulated and 146 downregulated in the ADSC group). The main cellular locations of these proteins were cellular anatomical entity and protein-containing complex, while the biological processes were cellular processes and biological regulation. The primary molecular functions were binding and catalytic activity, with GO enrichment focused on Wnt-protein binding, neural development, and collagen-containing extracellular matrix. Further analysis of PPI network nodes using LASSO regression identified Thy1 and Wls proteins, significantly upregulated in the ADSC group, as potentially crucial targets for ADSC application in diabetic wound treatment.;;Shandong Second Medical University;;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;SEP 13;2024;12;;;;;;;;1468220;10.3389/fcell.2024.1468220;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2024.1468220;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001321310900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous studies have evaluated the predictive utility of omics measurements, such as metabolites, proteins or polygenic scores, but have considered these separately. The improvement that combined omics biomarkers can provide over and above current clinical standard models is unclear. The aim of this study was to test the predictive performance of genome, proteome, metabolome and clinical biomarkers when added to established clinical prediction models for type 2 diabetes.Methods We developed sparse interpretable prediction models in a prospective, nested type 2 diabetes case-cohort study (N=1105, incident type 2 diabetes cases=375) with 10,792 person-years of follow-up, selecting from 5759 features across the genome, proteome, metabolome and clinical biomarkers using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. We compared the predictive performance of omics-derived predictors with a clinical model including the variables from the Cambridge Diabetes Risk Score and HbA(1c).Results Among single omics prediction models that did not include clinical risk factors, the top ten proteins alone achieved the highest performance (concordance index [C index]=0.82 [95% CI 0.75, 0.88]), suggesting the proteome as the most informative single omic layer in the absence of clinical information. However, the largest improvement in prediction of type 2 diabetes incidence over and above the clinical model was achieved by the top ten features across several omic layers (C index=0.87 [95% CI 0.82, 0.92], Delta C index=0.05, p=0.045). This improvement by the top ten omic features was also evident in individuals with HbA(1c) <42 mmol/mol (6.0%), the threshold for prediabetes (C index=0.84 [95% CI 0.77, 0.90], Delta C index=0.07, p=0.03), the group in whom prediction would be most useful since they are not targeted for preventative interventions by current clinical guidelines. In this subgroup, the type 2 diabetes polygenic risk score was the major contributor to the improvement in prediction, and achieved a comparable improvement in performance when added onto the clinical model alone (C index=0.83 [95% CI 0.75, 0.90], Delta C index=0.06, p=0.002). However, compared with those with prediabetes, individuals at high polygenic risk in this group had only around half the absolute risk for type 2 diabetes over a 20 year period.Conclusions/interpretation Omic approaches provided marginal improvements in prediction of incident type 2 diabetes. However, while a polygenic risk score does improve prediction in people with an HbA(1c) in the normoglycaemic range, the group in whom prediction would be most useful, even individuals with a high polygenic burden in that subgroup had a low absolute type 2 diabetes risk. This suggests a limited feasibility of implementing targeted population-based genetic screening for preventative interventions.;;"University of Cambridge; Berlin Institute of Health; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; University of London; Queen Mary University London";;;;;;;;;;5;6;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2024;67;1;;;;;102;112;;10.1007/s00125-023-06027-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-023-06027-x;;OCT 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001092075600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods Untargeted proteomic and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional analyses and targeted proteomic analysis using parallel reaction-monitoring (PRM)-mass spectrometry was performed to determine the abundance of urinary complement proteins in healthy controls, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, and patients with T2DM and biopsy-proven DN. The abundance of each urinary complement protein was individually included in Cox proportional hazards models for predicting progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Results Untargeted proteomic and functional analysis using the KEGG showed that differentially expressed urinary proteins were primarily associated with the complement and coagulation cascades. Subsequent urinary complement proteins quantification using PRM showed that urinary abundances of C3, C9, and complement factor H (CFAH) correlated negatively with annual estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline, while urinary abundances of C5, decay-accelerating factor (DAF), and CD59 correlated positively with annual rate of eGFR decline. Furthermore, higher urinary abundance of CFAH and lower urinary abundance of DAF were independently associated with greater risk of progression to ESRD. Urinary abundance of CFAH and DAF had a larger area under the curve (AUC) than that of eGFR, proteinuria, or any pathological parameter. Moreover, the model that included CFAH or DAF had a larger AUC than that with only clinical or pathological parameters. Conclusion Urinary abundance of complement proteins was significantly associated with ESRD in patients with T2DM and biopsy-proven DN, indicating that therapeutically targeting the complement pathway may alleviate progression of DN.;;"Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Sichuan University; Monash University; Sichuan University";;;;;;;;;;19;21;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2021;44;12;;;;;2709;2723;;10.1007/s40618-021-01596-3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40618-021-01596-3;;MAY 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000655615300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Risk biomarkers associated with the early onset of DKD are urgently needed in youth with T2D. Methods We conducted an in-depth analysis of 6596 proteins (SomaScan 7K) in 374 baseline plasma samples from the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth study to identify multiprotein signatures associated with the onset of albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio >= 30 mg/g), a rapid decline in eGFR (annual eGFR decline >3 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and/or >= 3.3% at two consecutive visits), and hyperfiltration (>= 135 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at two consecutive visits). Elastic net Cox regression with ten-fold cross-validation was applied to the top 100 proteins (ranked by P value) to identify multiprotein signatures of time to development of DKD outcomes. Results Participants in the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth study (14 +/- 2 years, 63% female, 7 +/- 6 months diabetes duration) experienced high rates of early DKD: 43% developed albuminuria, 48% hyperfiltration, and 16% rapid eGFR decline. Increased levels of seven and three proteins were predictive of shorter time to develop albuminuria and rapid eGFR decline, respectively; 118 proteins predicted time to development of hyperfiltration. Elastic net Cox proportional hazards models identified multiprotein signatures of time to incident early DKD with concordance for models with clinical covariates and selected proteins between 0.81 and 0.96, whereas the concordance for models with clinical covariates only was between 0.56 and 0.63. Conclusions Our research sheds new light on proteomic changes early in the course of youth-onset T2D that associate with DKD. Proteomic analyses identified promising risk factors that predict DKD risk in youth with T2D and could deepen our understanding of DKD mechanisms and potential interventions.";;"University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Colorado School of Public Health; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Chiang Mai University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio; Boston University; University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK); University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Arizona; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Poitiers; University of Southern California; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Joslin Diabetes Center, Inc.; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Baylor College of Medicine; Baylor College Medical Hospital; University of Amsterdam; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Groningen";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2024;19;12;;;;;1603;1612;;10.2215/CJN.0000000000000559;http://dx.doi.org/10.2215/CJN.0000000000000559;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001373595500012;View Full Record in Web of Science

There is mounting evidence that diabetes may play a role in the greater incidence of EC. The molecular mechanisms of the interaction between type 2 diabetes and EC are not yet clearly understood yet. The present study was undertaken to investigate the plasma proteomics of EC patients with diabetes in comparison to those of EC patients without diabetes. Plasma samples were obtained from age-matched patients (EC diabetic and EC nondiabetic). Untargeted proteomic analysis was carried out using a two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Of the 33 proteins identified, which significantly differed in the plasma abundance between groups, 17 were upregulated and 16 were downregulated. The majority of the altered proteins are involved in the acute phase reaction, cholesterol metabolism, scavenging of heme from plasma, and plasma lipoprotein assembly and mobilization. alpha-2-macroglobulin, Ras association domain-containing protein 3, apolipoprotein A-I, alpha-1B-glycoprotein, and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein were significantly upregulated. The significantly downregulated proteins included haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A-IV, hemopexin, and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin. The differential expression of proteins found in patients who had EC and diabetes indicated severe disease and a poor prognosis. The protein interaction analysis showed dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism and heme scavenging pathways in these patients.;;"King Saud University; King Saud University; King Saud University; King Saud University; King Saud University; King Saud University";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;JAN 18;2024;9;4;;;;;4721;4732;;10.1021/acsomega.3c07992;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c07992;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001154862300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

T2D results from the impaired secretion or action of the insulin with a clinical phenotype of persistent hyperglycemia in the uncontrolled subjects. The disease clinical features appear after several years of latent preclinical asymptomatic conditions. Thus, when the disease is full blown, there are limited chances to reverse the disease phenotype; however, it can be managed by controlling diet, changing life style and using medicines. Understanding pathological mechanisms whereby genetic and/or environmental factors contribute to the development of diabetes is important for the prevention and treatment of the disease. In this regard, approaches such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics are being applied to identify more specific biomarkers for T2D for its early detection, management and devising new therapies. The emphasis of the present review is to provide updates on the applications of proteomics in addressing T2D with a focus on protein based biomarker discovery.

Serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) decreases with an increase in blood sugar >180 mg/dl. We hypothesized that salivary 1,5-AG can be used to identify blood sugar higher than 180 mg/dl using a novel biochemical method. Aim: This study aimed to develop a novel biochemical method for serum and salivary assessment of 1,5-AG and assess its correlation with postprandial blood sugar (PPBS) >180 mg/dl. Methodology: The study comprised 45 controls (healthy individuals) and 45 cases (type 2 diabetic patients with PPBS >180 mg/dl). Blood and salivary samples were collected according to the study protocol. A new method was developed for the quantification of 1,5-AG in serum and saliva using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: The value of serum (mean -22.19 mu g/ml and median -22.12 mu g/ml) and salivary (mean -0.124 mu g/ml and median -0.088 mu g/ml) 1,5-AG was higher in healthy individuals compared to corresponding serum (mean -3.89 mu g/ml and median -2.52 mu g/ml) and salivary (mean -0.025 mu g/ml and median - 0.025 mu g/ml) levels in diabetics with PPBS >180 mg/dl. In diabetics, a significant negative correlation was noticed with PPBS levels and 1,5-AG levels in serum and saliva. Salivary 1,5-AG level <0.054 mu g/ml had an 86.4% sensitivity and 87.2% specificity in predicting a blood sugar value >180 mg/dl. Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that the short-term glycemic marker 1,5-AG can be detected in saliva and can be useful as an adjunct marker in monitoring of glycemic status in diabetic patients.;;"Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education & Research; Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education & Research";;;;;;;;;;2;2;;;;;;;;;;;;2023;13;1;;;;;23;28;;10.4103/ijabmr.ijabmr_378_22;http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/ijabmr.ijabmr_378_22;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000996205300005;View Full Record in Web of Science

A previous targeted plasma proteomic study has indicated that ascorbic acid is associated with markers of the immune system in healthy subjects. However, the association between the levels of ascorbic acid and blood biomarkers in subjects at risk of developing T2D is still unknown. Serum ascorbic acid was measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography and serum proteins were quantified by untargeted liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry in 25 hyperinsulinemia subjects that were randomly assigned a high dairy intake diet or an adequate dairy intake diet for 6 weeks, then crossed-over after a 6-week washout period. Spearman correlation followed by gene ontology analyses were performed to identify biological pathways associated with ascorbic acid. Finally, machine learning analysis was performed to obtain a specific serum protein signature that could predict ascorbic acid levels. After adjustments for waist circumference, LDL, HDL, fasting insulin, fasting blood glucose, age, gender, and dairy intake; serum ascorbic acid correlated positively with different aspects of the immune system. Machine learning analysis indicated that a signature composed of 21 features that included 17 proteins (mainly from the immune system), age, sex, waist circumference, and LDL could predict serum ascorbic acid levels in hyperinsulinemia subjects. In conclusion, the result reveals a correlation as well as modulation between serum ascorbic acid levels and proteins that play vital roles in regulating different aspects of the immune response in individuals at risk of T2D. The development of a predictive signature for ascorbic acid will further help the assessment of ascorbic acid status in clinical settings.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Objective: To examine the overall associations of LPIs and their related metabolites, such as nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and acylcarnitines, with incident and prevalent type 2 diabetes using a targeted approach. Design and Setting: A case-control study was nested within the Singapore Chinese Health Study. Cases and controls were individually matched by age, sex, and date of blood collection. We used both liquid and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to measure serum metabolite levels at baseline, including 8 LPIs, 19 NEFAs, and 34 acylcarnitines.

Participants: Participants included 160 incident and 144 prevalent cases with type 2 diabetes and 304 controls. Main Outcome Measure: Incident and prevalent type 2 diabetes. Results: On the basis of a false discovery rate,0.1, we identified 37 metabolites associated with prevalent type 2 diabetes, including 7 LPIs, 18 NEFAs, and 12 acylcarnitines, and 11 metabolites associated with incident type 2 diabetes, including 2 LPIs and 9 NEFAs. Two metabolites, LPI (16: 1) and dihomo-g-linolenic acid, showed independent associations with incident type 2 diabetes and significantly enhanced the risk prediction.

Dissecting the specific metabolic changes induced by disease through metabolomics has shown potential to improve our understanding of relevant pathophysiological mechanisms of disease, which could lead to improved treatment.

Partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) showed good separation of patient groups. Amine levels were strongly altered in both disease groups compared to healthy controls, including low concentrations of citrulline and ornithine. Several amino acid ratios discriminated TB from controls (phenylalanine/histidine; citrulline/arginine; kynurenine/tryptophan), possibly reflecting changes in indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Choline, glycine, serine, threonine and homoserine levels were lower in TB-DM compared to TB, and, in contrast to other analytes, did not normalize to healthy control levels during antibiotic treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were divided into a diabetic and no-diabetic group according to inclusion and exclusion cri-teria. Power analysis was adopted from a pre-vious study that reported GCF chemokines in obese individuals. All teeth were measured for clinical periodontal parameters (CPP). GCF and saliva were collected 3 months after placing stainless steel archwire. GCF was investigated for pro-inflammatory cytokines all expressed in pg/mL. Quantification of chemokines was per-formed using a Magnetic bead-based multiplex assay for the Luminex (R) platform. Non-normality of data was assessed by Mann-Whitney U-test. Normality was estimated using an Independent t-test. Descriptive data were computed in the form of standard deviations and means. RESULTS: Unstimulated whole saliva flow rate (UWSFR) was significantly lower in diabet-ic patients compared to non-diabetics (p=.021). Amongst different clinical periodontal parame-ters (CPP) no difference in plaque scores (PS) and probing depth (PD) was found between di-abetic and non-diabetic participants. Two GCF chemokines i.e., Resistin (p=.031) and AGEs (p=.017) were observed to be significantly high-er in DMT2 participants compared to the non -di-abetes group.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic administration of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), a water-soluble dietary fiber, on the occurrence of diabetes and its complications, fatty liver and nephropathy. We also identified predictive serum biomarkers of treatment response to PHGG by mass spectroscopy-based proteomic analysis using Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a good model of human non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In this study, at 5 weeks of age, OLETF rats and control strain Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats were fed a control diet or a high-fiber diet (5% PHGG) for 57 weeks. Body weight, food intake, oral glucose tolerance test, plasma insulin levels, and urine glucose and protein levels were regularly measured. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and storage of serum in a deep freezer were conducted at the beginning of the experiment and every 4 weeks after overnight fasting during the experiments. PHGG treatment affected neither meal patterns nor the body weight of OLETF and LETO rats. Repeated measure analysis of variance revealed significant differences in fasting plasma glucose and plasma glucose at 2 h after OGTT between control OLETF (OLETF-C) rats and OLETF rats treated with PHGG (OLETF-F). The glucose response determined by the area under the curve of OGTT was significantly greater in OLETF-C rats than that in OLETF-F rats at 25 weeks of age. HOMA-IR, an index of insulin resistance, increased at 25 weeks of age in OLETF-C rats, while this increase was significantly inhibited in OLETF-F rats. At 62 weeks of age, PHGG treatment significantly improved hepatic steatosis as well as renal mesangial matrix accumulation in OLETF rats. To identify the risk marker for diabetes mellitus by SELDI-TOF MS, we collected sera from 21-week-old individuals. Among the 12 specific peaks that were risk marker candidates for diabetes mellitus, the m/z 13,720 peak was identified as that of cysteinylated transthyretin by sequencing of four tryptic peptides using tandem mass spectrometry and peak distribution around the m/z 13,720 peak in the SELDI-TOF spectra.

The urinary proteome is known to be a valuable field of study and has become one of the most attractive subdisciplines in clinical proteomics for human diseases. We have described the levels of protein biomarkers specific to diabetes mellitus type 2 in the Pakistani population using proteomic technology. Methods: One hundred type 2 diabetes patients with 50 age-and sex-matched normal healthy controls were recruited from Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Urinary proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional liquid chromatography, using chromatofocusing in the first dimension and reverse-phase chromatography in the second, followed by mass spectrometric analysis. Levels of the proteins, which were found to vary in the diabetes type 2 patients compared to the controls, were then determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in all the samples. Results: Levels of transthyretin, alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor, and haptoglobin precursor decreased by 30.8%, 55.2%, and 81.45%, whereas levels of albumin, zinc alpha 2 glycoprotein, retinol binding protein 4, and E-cadherin increased by 486.5%, 29.23%, 100%, and 693%, respectively, in the diabetes patients compared to the controls. Conclusions: Variation in the levels of these identified protein biomarkers have been reported in other pathological states. Assessment of the levels of these biomarkers will be helpful not only in early diagnosis but also in prognosis of diabetes mellitus type 2.;;"University of London; Birkbeck University London; University College London; University of Punjab; University of Punjab";;;;;;;;;;28;33;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2010;12;12;;;;;979;988;;10.1089/dia.2010.0078;http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/dia.2010.0078;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000284943500007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Currently, a bottom-up proteomics approach has been applied to discover serum biomarkers. However, the approach was labor intensive, time and cost consuming, and cannot meet the requirements for clinical application. In this work, Fe3O4/C@MIL-100 composites were synthesized to efficiently capture peptides from microwave-assisted formic acid digests of BSA and human serum prior to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Fe3O4/C@MIL-100 composites exhibited size-selective adsorption performance, thus providing a rapid and convenient approach to enrich low-abundance peptides. Notably, the peptides' mass fingerprinting of serum digestions between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and healthy persons were distinguishable, which indicated the potential ability of this technique for T2DM diagnosis and rapid biomarker discovery.;;"Tianjin Modern Vocational Technology College; Tianjin University; Tianjin University; Tiangong University";;;;;;;;;;24;24;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2017;409;7;;;;;1895;1904;;10.1007/s00216-016-0136-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-016-0136-2;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000394377200018;View Full Record in Web of Science

The large quantity of these proteins makes it difficult to identify low abundance proteins in serum using traditional 2-dimensional electrophoresis. We recently used a combination of multidimensional liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-quadrupole-time of flight and Ion Trap liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify protein markers in sera of Alzheimer's disease (AD), insulin resistance/type-2 diabetes (IR/D2), and congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. We identified 8 proteins that exhibit higher levels in control sera and 36 proteins that exhibit higher levels in disease sera. For example, haptoglobin and hemoglobin are elevated in sera of AD, IR/D2, and CHF patients. The levels of several other proteins including fibrinogen and its fragments, alpha 2-macroglobulin, transthyretin, pro-platelet basic protein, protease inhibitors clade A and C, as well as proteins involved in the classical complement pathway such as complement C3, C4,and C1 inhibitor, were found to differ between IR/D2 and control sera. The sera levels of proteins, such as the 10 kDa subunit of vitronectin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, apolipoprotein B100, fragment of factor H, and histidine-rich glycoprotein were observed to be different between AD and controls. The differences observed in these biomarker candidates were confirmed by Western blot and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The biological meaning of the proteomic changes in the disease states and the potential use of these changes as diagnostic tools or for therapeutic intervention will be discussed.;;"University of Guelph; University of Toronto";;;;;;;;;;152;185;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2004;4;1;;;;;244;256;;10.1002/pmic.200300495;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pmic.200300495;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000188591100022;View Full Record in Web of Science

The four groups were formed by individuals with DM2 and periodontitis (DM2 + P, n = 20), DM2 without periodontitis (DM2, n = 20), periodontitis without DM2 (P, n = 20) and individuals without periodontitis and without DM2 (H, n = 20). Periodontal clinical examinations were performed and unstimulated saliva was collected. Proteomic analysis was performed by shotgun mass spectrometry. The results were obtained by searching the Homo sapiens database of the UniProt catalog.ResultsA total of 220 proteins were identified in saliva samples. In the comparison between DM2 + P and DM2 groups, 27 proteins were up-regulated [e.g. S100-A8 was 6 times up-regulated (humoral immune response pathway)]. The DM2 + P and P groups had 26 up-regulated proteins [e.g. Immunoglobulin lambda constant 7 more than 2 times up-regulated (complement activation pathway)]. The non-DM2 groups (P and H) presented 22 up-regulated proteins [e.g. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase more than 2 times up-regulated (Peptidyl-cysteine S-nitrosylation pathway)]. The groups without periodontitis (DM2 and H) showed 23 were up-regulated proteins [e.g. Hemoglobin subunit alpha that was more than 10 times up-regulated (cellular oxidant detoxification pathway)].ConclusionThe presence of DM2 and periodontitis significantly impacts the salivary proteome. Our proteomic analysis demonstrated that changes in the S100 family proteins (S100A8 and S100 A9) are highly related to the presence of DM2 and periodontitis.Clinical relevanceDiabetes Mellitus (DM) and periodontitis are highly prevalent chronic diseases that present a wide variety of signs and symptoms. They present a bidirectional relationship, where patients with DM have a higher prevalence and severity of periodontitis, and patients with periodontitis have a higher prevalence of DM, worse glycemic control, and more diabetic complications. Diagnosing periodontitis requires specific clinical examinations, which require a highly trained operator. In this study, we used high throughput proteomics in order to evaluate non-invasive biomarkers for periodontitis in type 2 DM subjects. The results can contribute to earlier, more accurate, and less costly diagnosis of periodontitis in diabetic subjects, enabling better diabetes control.;;"Universidade de Taubate; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Universidade Estadual Paulista";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;JAN 23;2025;29;1;;;;;;;77;10.1007/s00784-025-06171-1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00784-025-06171-1;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001403628600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The pathogenesis of DPN is not fully known, but several pathways and gene polymorphisms contributing to DPN are described. DPN can be studied using nerve biopsies, but studies on the proteome of the nerve itself, and its surrounding tissue as a whole, are lacking. Studies on the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) have proposed PIN a useful indicator of DPN. Methods A quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis was made of peripheral nerves from age- and gender-matched living human male tissue donors; nine type 2 diabetes subjects, with decreased sural nerve action potentials indicating DPN, and six controls without type 2 diabetes, with normal electrophysiology results. Results A total of 2617 proteins were identified. Linear regression was used to discover which proteins were differentially expressed between type 2 diabetes and controls. Only soft signals were found. Therefore, clustering of the 500 most variable proteins was made to find clusters of similar proteins in type 2 diabetes subjects and healthy controls. Conclusions This feasibility study shows, for the first time, that the use of quantitative mass spectrometry enables quantification of proteins from nerve biopsies from subjects with and without type 2 diabetes, which may aid in finding biomarkers of importance to DPN development.";;"Lund University; Lund University; Skane University Hospital; Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; Skane University Hospital";;;;;;;;;;12;13;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2021;38;11;;;;;;;e14658;10.1111/dme.14658;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/dme.14658;;AUG 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000680949800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an alternative therapy to delay the development of macrovascular diseases, but the existing evidence of its efficacy, safety and mechanism of action is insufficient. We report a study protocol of a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that aims to use well-designed clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) Shen-Qi Hua-Yu formula, and to explore efficacy mechanism of the TCM granules and the biomarkers of TCM syndrome. Methods: This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled study that randomized 120 participants into 2 groups. The treatment group will receive TCM granules and conventional medicine, while the control group will receive placebo in addition to conventional medicine. Two groups will receive 12-week treatment and 48-week follow-up, with a total of 13 visits. Primary efficacy outcomes included ankle brachial index. Secondary efficacy outcomes included fasting plasma glucose, blood lipid, hemorheology indexes, advanced glycation end products, the inner diameter, peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity and mean average velocity of the anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis artery, and TCM syndrome score. The safety and endpoint outcomes will be evaluated in this trial. The study will explain the biological therapeutic mechanism of Shen-Qi Hua-Yu formula for diabetic LEAD, and try to use Isobaric tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) and Western blot to screen biomarkers of characteristic diagnosis and clinical efficiency evaluation of the TCM syndrome. Discussion: This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHM in patients with diabetic LEAD, and to interpret the therapeutic mechanism of Shen-Qi Hua-Yu formula in treatment of diabetic LEAD through proteomics technology, and to screen biomarkers with characteristics of TCM diagnosis and clinical efficacy evaluation. On the other hand, to our knowledge, this study may be the first trial of CHM formulas to observe cardiovascular outcomes through long-term follow-up for the treatment of diabetic LEAD, which is of great value.;;Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine;;;;;;;;;;4;5;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2020;99;3;;;;;;;e18713;10.1097/MD.0000000000018713;http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000018713;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000524950700018;View Full Record in Web of Science

Current selective screening strategies rely on clinical risk factors such as age, family history of diabetes, macrosomia or GDM in a previous pregnancy, and they possess a relatively low specificity. Here we hypothesize that novel first trimester protein predictors of GDM can contribute to the current selective screening strategies for early and accurate prediction of GDM, thus allowing for timely interventions. Methods A proteomics discovery approach was applied to first trimester sera from obese (BMI >= 27 kg/m(2)) women (n = 60) in a nested case-control study design, utilizing tandem mass tag labelling and tandem mass spectrometry. A subset of the identified protein markers was further validated in a second set of serum samples (n = 210) and evaluated for their contribution as predictors of GDM in relation to the maternal risk factors, by use of logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results Serum proteomic profiling identified 25 proteins with significantly different levels between cases and controls. Three proteins; afamin, serum amyloid P-component and vitronectin could be further confirmed as predictors of GDM in a validation set. Vitronectin was shown to contribute significantly to the predictive power of the maternal risk factors, indicating it as a novel independent predictor of GDM.

However, it remains unknown whether plasma metabolomic profiles related to proinflammatory/hyperinsulinaemic diets and to inflammatory/insulin biomarkers are associated with type 2 diabetes risk.MethodsWe analysed 6840 participants from the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study to identify the plasma metabolome related to empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP), empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH), four circulating inflammatory biomarkers and C-peptide. Dietary intakes were assessed using validated food frequency questionnaires. Plasma metabolomic profiling was conducted by LC-MS/MS. Metabolomic signatures were derived using elastic net regression. Multivariable Cox regression was used to examine associations of the metabolomic profiles with type 2 diabetes risk.ResultsWe identified 27 metabolites commonly associated with both EDIP and inflammatory biomarker z score and 21 commonly associated with both EDIH and C-peptide. Higher metabolomic dietary inflammatory potential (MDIP), reflecting higher metabolic potential of both an inflammatory dietary pattern and circulating inflammatory biomarkers, was associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk. The HR comparing highest vs lowest quartiles of MDIP was 3.26 (95% CI 2.39, 4.44). We observed a strong positive association with type 2 diabetes risk for the metabolomic signature associated with EDIP-only (HR 3.75; 95% CI 2.71, 5.17) or inflammatory biomarkers-only (HR 4.07; 95% CI 2.91, 5.69). In addition, higher metabolomic dietary index for hyperinsulinaemia (MDIH), reflecting higher metabolic potential of both an insulinaemic dietary pattern and circulating C-peptide, was associated with greater type 2 diabetes risk (HR 3.00; 95% CI 2.22, 4.06); further associations with type 2 diabetes were HR 2.79 (95% CI 2.07, 3.76) for EDIH-only signature and HR 3.89 (95% CI 2.82, 5.35) for C-peptide-only signature. The diet scores were significantly associated with risk, although adjustment for the corresponding metabolomic signature scores attenuated the associations with type 2 diabetes, these remained significant.Conclusions/interpretationThe metabolomic signatures reflecting proinflammatory or hyperinsulinaemic diets and related biomarkers were positively associated with type 2 diabetes risk, supporting that these dietary patterns may influence type 2 diabetes risk via the regulation of metabolism.";;"Yonsei University; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Micro-albuminuria has been central to the development of clinical practise in prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular disease. Treatment-induced and spontaneous remission of microalbuminuria has been reported both in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, underlining the importance of sustained elevation of urinary albumin excretion. Recently many new biomarkers have been evaluated in diabetic patients, and apart from urinary proteomics, none has yet outperformed Harry Keen's discovery of microalbuminuria as the best screening tool for diabetic nephropathy. Remission of microalbuminuria preserves renal function. Microalbuminuria has also stood the test of time as a valid powerful independent predictor for fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular outcome in diabetes. Improved glycaemic control, blood pressure reduction, RAS blockade and multifactorial treatment of cardiovascular risk factors reduce the risk of development of micro-and macroalbuminuria, declining renal function and cardiovascular events.

This is mainly due to an unhealthy nutrition, implying that variation in CVD risk may be due to variation in the capacity to manage a nutritional load. We examined the genomic basis of postprandial metabolism. Our main purpose was to introduce the GEMM Family Study (Genetics of Metabolic Diseases in Mexico) as a multi-center study carrying out an ongoing recruitment of healthy urban adults. Each participant received a mixed meal challenge and provided a 5-hours' time course series of blood, buffy coat specimens for DNA isolation, and adipose tissue (ADT)/skeletal muscle (SKM) biopsies at fasting and 3 h after the meal. A comprehensive profiling, including metabolomic signatures in blood and transcriptomic and proteomic profiling in SKM and ADT, was performed to describe tendencies for variation in postprandial response. Our data generation methods showed preliminary trends indicating that by characterizing the dynamic properties of biomarkers with metabolic activity and analyzing multi-OMICS data it could be possible, with this methodology and research design, to identify early trends for molecular biology systems and genes involved in the fasted and fed states.;;"Texas Biomedical Research Institute; Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon; Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi; Universidad Anahuac; Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon; Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica; Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos; Universidad Veracruzana; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio";;;;;;;;;;8;9;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2018;9;11;;;;;;;532;10.3390/genes9110532;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes9110532;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000451636700017;View Full Record in Web of Science

Biological network models, including metabolic, transcriptional regulatory, protein-protein interaction, signalling and co-expression networks, can provide a scaffold for studying the biological pathways operating in the liver in connection with disease development in a systematic manner. Here, we review studies in which biological network models were used to integrate multiomics data to advance our understanding of the pathophysiological responses of complex liver diseases. We also discuss how this mechanistic approach can contribute to the discovery of potential biomarkers and novel drug targets, which might lead to the design of targeted and improved treatment strategies.

Analyzing the plasma proteomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes may illuminate hitherto unknown functional mechanisms underlying disease pathology. We assessed the associations between type 2 diabetes and >1,000 plasma proteins in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) F4 cohort (n = 993, 110 cases), with subsequent replication in the third wave of the Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT3) cohort (n = 940, 149 cases). We computed logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and hypertension. Additionally, we investigated associations with incident type 2 diabetes and performed two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to prioritize our results. Association analysis of prevalent type 2 diabetes revealed 24 replicated proteins, of which 8 are novel. Proteins showing association with incident type 2 diabetes were aminoacylase-1, growth hormone receptor, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2. Aminoacylase-1 was associated with both prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes. MR analysis yielded nominally significant causal effects of type 2 diabetes on cathepsin Z and rennin, both known to have roles in the pathophysiological pathways of cardiovascular disease, and of sex hormone-binding globulin on type 2 diabetes.

Classical biomarkers of CKD progression include quantitative proteinuria, the percentage of sclerotic glomeruli or fractional interstitial fibrosis. New candidate biomarkers (e.g., urinary proteomic patterns) are being developed based on both mechanistic and shotgun approaches. Validation of potential biomarkers in prospective studies as surrogate endpoints for hard clinical outcomes is often complicated by the long lag time to the ultimate clinical outcome (e.g., end-stage renal disease). The very dense data sets that result from shotgun approaches on small numbers of patients carry a significant risk of model overfitting, leading to spurious associations. New analytic methods can help to decrease this risk. It is likely that clinical practice will come to depend increasingly on multiplex (vector) biomarkers used in conjunction with risk markers in early diagnosis as well as to guide therapy.;;Children's Hospital Los Angeles;;;;;;;;;;16;20;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2007;22;11;;;;;1849;1859;;10.1007/s00467-007-0455-9;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00467-007-0455-9;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000249820000005;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study assessed 80 cardiovascular and inflammatory proteins for biomarker discovery and prediction of MACE in type 2 diabetes. Methods We combined data from six prospective epidemiological studies of 30-77-year-old individuals with type 2 diabetes in whom 80 circulating proteins were measured by proximity extension assay. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used in a discovery/replication design to identify biomarkers for incident MACE. We used gradient-boosted machine learning and lasso regularised Cox regression in a random 75% training subsample to assess whether adding proteins to risk factors included in the Swedish National Diabetes Register risk model would improve the prediction of MACE in the separate 25% test subsample. Results Of 1211 adults with type 2 diabetes (32% women), 211 experienced a MACE over a mean (+/- SD) of 6.4 +/- 2.3 years. We replicated associations (< 5% false discovery rate) between risk of MACE and eight proteins: matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12, IL-27 subunit alpha (IL-27a), kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23, protein S100-A12, TNF receptor (TNFR)-1, TNFR-2 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL-R)2. Addition of the 80-protein assay to established risk factors improved discrimination in the separate test sample from 0.686 (95% CI 0.682, 0.689) to 0.748 (95% CI 0.746, 0.751). A sparse model of 20 added proteins achieved a C statistic of 0.747 (95% CI 0.653, 0.842) in the test sample. Conclusions/interpretation We identified eight protein biomarkers, four of which are novel, for risk of MACE in community residents with type 2 diabetes, and found improved risk prediction by combining multiplex proteomics with an established risk model.

This defect is characterised by reduced secretion of glucagon and other counterregulatory hormones. Evidence indicates that glucose-responsive neurons located in the hypothalamus orchestrate the CRR. Here, we aimed to identify the changes in hypothalamic gene and protein expression that underlie impaired CRR in a mouse model of defective CRR.Methods High-fat-diet fed and low-dose streptozocin-treated C57BL/6N mice were exposed to one (acute hypoglycaemia [AH]) or multiple (recurrent hypoglycaemia [RH]) insulin-induced hypoglycaemic episodes and plasma glucagon levels were measured. Single-nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data were obtained from the hypothalamus and cortex of mice exposed to AH and RH. Proteomic data were obtained from hypothalamic synaptosomal fractions.Results The final insulin injection resulted in similar plasma glucose levels in the RH group and AH groups, but glucagon secretion was significantly lower in the RH group (AH: 94.5 +/- 9.2 ng/l [n=33]; RH: 59.0 +/- 4.8 ng/l [n=37]; p<0.001). Analysis of snRNA-seq data revealed similar proportions of hypothalamic cell subpopulations in the AH- and RH-exposed mice. Changes in transcriptional profiles were found in all cell types analysed. In neurons from RH-exposed mice, we observed a significant decrease in expression of Avp, Pmch and Pcsk1n, and the most overexpressed gene was Kcnq1ot1, as compared with AH-exposed mice. Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) indicated a coordinated decrease in many oxidative phosphorylation genes and reduced expression of vacuolar H+- and Na+/K+-ATPases; these observations were in large part confirmed in the proteomic analysis of synaptosomal fractions. Compared with AH-exposed mice, oligodendrocytes from RH-exposed mice had major changes in gene expression that suggested reduced myelin formation. In astrocytes from RH-exposed mice, DEGs indicated reduced capacity for neurotransmitters scavenging in tripartite synapses as compared with astrocytes from AH-exposed mice. In addition, in neurons and astrocytes, multiple changes in gene expression suggested increased amyloid beta (A beta) production and stability. The snRNA-seq analysis of the cortex showed that the adaptation to RH involved different biological processes from those seen in the hypothalamus.Conclusions/interpretation The present study provides a model of defective counterregulation in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. It shows that repeated hypoglycaemic episodes induce multiple defects affecting all hypothalamic cell types and their interactions, indicative of impaired neuronal network signalling and dysegulated hypoglycaemia sensing, and displaying features of neurodegenerative diseases. It also shows that repeated hypoglycaemia leads to specific molecular adaptation in the hypothalamus when compared with the cortex.Data availabilityThe transcriptomic dataset is available via the GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), using the accession no.

The involvement of inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can affect the kidney and contribute to the development of diabetic kidney disease. Therefore we examined the association of urinary fetuin-A protein fragments with renal damage in T2DM patients. Methods: Urinary peptides of 1491 individuals using proteome data available from the human urine proteome database were analysed. Prediction of proteases involved in urinary peptide generation was performed using the Proteasix tool. Results: We identified 14 different urinary protein fragments that belong to the region of the connecting peptide (amino acid 301-339) of the total fetuin-A protein. Calpains (CAPN1 and CAPN2), matrix metalloproteinase and pepsin A-3 were identified as potential proteases that were partially confirmed by previous in vitro studies. Combined fetuin-A peptides (mean of amplitudes) were significantly increased in T2DM patients with kidney disease and to a lesser extent with cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, fetuin-A peptide levels displayed a significant negative correlation with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values (r=-0.316, P<0.0001) and with the slope (%) of eGFR per year (r=-0.096, P=0.023). A multiple regression model including fetuin-A peptide and albuminuria resulted in a significantly improved correlation with eGFR (r=-0.354, P<0.0001) compared with albuminuria, indicating an added value of this novel biomarker. Conclusions: The urinary proteome analysis demonstrated the association of fetuin-A peptides with impaired kidney function in T2DM patients. Furthermore, fetuin-A peptides displayed early signs of kidney damage before albuminuria appeared and therefore can be used as markers for kidney disease detection.;;"Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) Solutions; University of Glasgow; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen";;;;;;;;;;12;13;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2021;14;1;;;;;269;276;;10.1093/ckj/sfaa176;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ckj/sfaa176;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000642311200032;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, repeated measurements of BCAA/AAA and their interactions with dietary interventions have not been evaluated. We investigated the associations between baseline and changes at 1 year in BCAA/AAA with type 2 diabetes in the context of a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) trial. Methods We included 251 participants with incident type 2 diabetes and a random sample of 694 participants (641 participants without type 2 diabetes and 53 overlapping cases) in a case-cohort study nested within the PREvencin con DIeta MEDiterranea (PREDIMED) trial. Participants were randomised to a MedDiet+extra-virgin olive oil (n = 273), a MedDiet+nuts (n = 324) or a control diet (n = 295). We used LC-MS/MS to measure plasma levels of amino acids. Type 2 diabetes was a pre-specified secondary outcome of the PREDIMED trial. Results Elevated plasma levels of individual BCAAs/AAAs were associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk after a median follow-up of 3.8 years: multivariable HR for the highest vs lowest quartile ranged from 1.32 for phenylalanine ([95% CI 0.90, 1.92], p for trend = 0.015) to 3.29 for leucine ([95% CI 2.03, 5.34], p for trend<0.001). Increases in BCAA score at 1 year were associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk in the control group with HR per SD = 1.61 (95% CI 1.02, 2.54), but not in the MedDiet groups (p for interaction <0.001). The MedDiet+extra-virgin olive oil significantly reduced BCAA levels after 1 year of intervention (p = 0.005 vs the control group). Conclusions/interpretation Our results support that higher baseline BCAAs and their increases at 1 year were associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk. A Mediterranean diet rich in extra-virgin olive oil significantly reduced the levels of BCAA and attenuated the positive association between plasma BCAA levels and type 2 diabetes incidence.;;"University of Navarra; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBEROBN; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

In Western societies, the increase in the elderly population, which is accompanied by ageing-associated pathologies such as cardiovascular and mental diseases, is becoming an increasing economic and social burden for governments. In order to prevent, treat and determine which subjects are more likely to develop these age-related diseases, predictive biomarkers are required. In this sense, some studies suggest that glycans have a potential role as disease biomarkers, as they modify the functions of proteins and take part in intra- and intercellular biological processes. As the glycome reflects the real-time status of these interactions, its characterisation can provide potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for multifactorial diseases. This review gathers the alterations in protein glycosylation profiles that are associated with ageing and age-related diseases, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and several chronic inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, the review includes the available techniques for the determination and characterisation of glycans, such as liquid chromatography, electrophoresis, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.;;Universitat Rovira i Virgili;;;;;;;;;;32;34;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2021;22;11;;;;;;;5788;10.3390/ijms22115788;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms22115788;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000660125200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

An early neurodegenerative component of diabetic retinal disease (DRD) that precedes the vascular findings of clinically diagnosed diabetic retinopathy (DR) is increasingly being recognized. However, the relevant molecular mechanisms and biomarkers for early DRD are poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to uncover novel potential mediators of early diabetic retinal neuronal dysfunction through analysis of the aqueous fluid proteome in preclinical DR. METHODS. Aqueous fluid was collected from subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) but no clinical DR and from nondiabetic controls undergoing routine cataract surgery. Preoperative spectral-domain optical coherence tomography of the macula was obtained. Tandem mass tag LC-MS/MS was performed to identify proteins differentially present in diabetic and control aqueous fluid, and proteins with >50% change and P < 0.05 were considered significant. Selected results were validated with western blot of human aqueous fluid samples. RESULTS. We identified decreased levels of proteins implicated in neuronal synapse formation and increased levels of inflammatory proteins in the aqueous fluid from patients with type 2 DM but no DR compared with controls. Of the differentially present synaptic proteins that we identified and confirmed with western blot, the majority have not previously been linked with DRD. CONCLUSIONS. The proteomic profile of aqueous fluid from individuals with type 2 DM but no DR suggests that retinal neuronal dysfunction and inflammation represent very early events in the pathophysiology of DRD. These findings support the concept that diabetic retinal neurodegeneration precedes vascular pathology and reveal novel potential mediators and/or biomarkers warranting further investigation.;;"Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Medicine; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Medicine; Institute for Systems Biology (ISB); New York University";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2024;65;3;;;;;;;16;10.1167/iovs.65.3.16;http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/iovs.65.3.16;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001221654900007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Measurement of urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) has recently become more popular as a means of assessing oxidative stress in the human body. The aim of this study is to compare the levels of urine 8-OHdG in patients with type 2 diabetes with and without nephropathy and to evaluate its role as a biochemical marker for distinguishing these patients from healthy and patients without complications. Methods. For this purpose, 52 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (32 with nephropathy (DMN), 20 without nephropathy (DM)) and 20 healthy control subjects (C) were included in this study. The urine concentrations of 8-OHdG were measured by modified LC-MS/MS method and compared with the first morning voiding urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) and HbA1c values of the same patients. Results. The concentrations of urine 8-OHdG in DMN and DM patients were higher than those of the control subjects (3.47 +/- 0.94, 2.92 +/- 1.73, 2.1 +/- 0.93 nmol/mol creatinine, respectively). But there was no statistical difference between DMN and DM (p = 0.115). There is significant correlation between urinary 8-OHdG and UACR (r = 0.501, p <= 0.001). According to ROC analysis, the AUC value of HbA1c was higher than the value of the AUC of 8-OHdG (0.882 and 0.771, respectively). Conclusions. This study shows that the urine 8-OHdG levels increase in diabetic patients. However, urinary 8-OHdG is not a useful clinical marker, compared with UACR, to predict the development of diabetic nephropathy in diabetic patients.;;"Gulhane Military Medical Academy; Ankara Kecioren Training & Research Hospital";;;;;;;;;;43;45;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2012;46;10;;;;;1291;1295;;10.3109/10715762.2012.710902;http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/10715762.2012.710902;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000308947400012;View Full Record in Web of Science

The pathological events causing beta-cell dysfunctions are only poorly understood and earl), markers that would predict islet function are missing. In contrast to immunoassays, unbiased proteomic technologies provide the opportunity to screen for novel marker protein and peptides of T2DM. An important subset of the proteome. peptides and peptide hormones secreted by the pancreas are deregulated in T2DM. The mass range of peptides and small proteins (1-20 kDa) is only sufficiently targeted by peptidomics, a combination of liquid chromatographic and mass spectrometric (MS) peptide analysis. Here, we describe the application of isotope label-free quantitative peptidomics to display and quantify relevant changes in the level of pancreatic peptides and peptide hormones in a preclinical model of T2DM, the Lep(ob)/Lep(ob) mouse. The amino acid sequence of statistical relevant top candidates was determined by MS/MS fragmentation or Edman degradation. The comparison of lean versus obese mice revealed increased levels of islet-specific peptides that can be divided into the following categories 1) the major islet peptide hormones insulin, amylin and glucagon; 2) proinsulin and C-peptide and 3) novel processing products of secretogranin, glucagon and amylin. Furthermore. we found increased levels of proteins and peptides implicated in zymogen granule maturation (syncollin) and nutritional digestion.

We hypothesized that an integrative multi-omics approach might improve identification of subgroups of individuals with obesity who have distinct cardiometabolic disease patterns.MethodsWe performed machine learning-based, integrative unsupervised clustering to identify proteomics- and metabolomics-defined subpopulations of individuals living with obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m2), leveraging data from 243 individuals in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort. Omics that contributed to the observed clusters were functionally characterized. We performed multivariate regression to assess whether the individuals in each cluster demonstrated differential patterns of cardiometabolic traits.ResultsWe identified two distinct clusters (iCluster1 and 2). iCluster2 had significantly higher average BMI values, fasting blood glucose, and inflammation. iCluster1 was associated with higher levels of total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Pathways mediating cell growth, lipogenesis, and energy expenditures were positively associated with iCluster1. Inflammatory response and insulin resistance pathways were positively associated with iCluster2.ConclusionsAlthough the two identified clusters may represent progressive obesity-related pathologic processes measured at different stages, other mechanisms in combination could also underpin the identified clusters given no significant age difference between the comparative groups. For instance, clusters may reflect differences in dietary/behavioral patterns or differential rates of metabolic damage.;;"University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; University of Vermont; Duke University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Broad Institute; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Broad Institute; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Wake Forest University; Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center; Cedars Sinai Medical Center; Boston University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; University of Virginia; Geisinger Health System";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2024;32;11;;;;;2024;2034;;10.1002/oby.24137;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/oby.24137;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001348604900008;View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present study, we investigated the association between serum melatonin and type 2 diabetes risk in a southern Chinese population in a case-control study. We also examined the role of gut microbiota in this relationship. Methods Individuals with type 2 diabetes (cases) and healthy individuals (controls) (n=2034) were recruited from a cross-sectional study and were matched for age and sex in a case-control study. The levels of serum melatonin were measured and the association between serum melatonin and type 2 diabetes risk was examined using a multivariable logistic regression model. We further conducted a rigorously matched case-control study (n=120) in which gut microbial 16S rRNA was sequenced and metabolites were profiled using an untargeted LC-MS/MS approach. Results Higher levels of serum melatonin were significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (OR 0.82 [95% CI 0.74, 0.92]) and with lower levels of fasting glucose after adjustment for covariates (beta -0.25 [95% CI -0.38, -0.12]). Gut microbiota exhibited alteration in the individuals with type 2 diabetes, in whom lower levels of serum melatonin, lower alpha- and beta-diversity of gut microbiota (p<0.05), greater abundance of Bifidobacterium and lower abundance of Coprococcus (linear discriminant analysis [LDA] >2.0) were found. Seven genera were correlated with melatonin and type 2 diabetes-related traits; among them Bifidobacterium was positively correlated with serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IL-10, whereas Coprococcus was negatively correlated with serum IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-alpha and LPS (Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted p value [false discovery rate (FDR)] <0.05). Moreover, altered metabolites were detected in the participants with type 2 diabetes and there was a significant correlation between tryptophan (Trp) metabolites and the melatonin-correlated genera including Bifidobacterium and Coprococcus (FDR<0.05). Similarly, a significant correlation was found between Trp metabolites and inflammation factors, such as IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-alpha and LPS (FDR<0.05). Further, we showed that Trp metabolites may serve as a biomarker to predict type 2 diabetes status (AUC=0.804). Conclusions/interpretation A higher level of serum melatonin was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Gut microbiota-mediated melatonin signalling was involved in this association; especially, Bifidobacterium- and Coprococcus-mediated Trp metabolites may be involved in the process. These findings uncover the importance of melatonin and melatonin-related bacteria and metabolites as potential therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes.";;"Guangxi Medical University; Guangxi Medical University; Guangxi Medical University";;;;;;;;;;18;18;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2022;65;10;;;;;1627;1641;;10.1007/s00125-022-05747-w;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-022-05747-w;;JUN 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000819037100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Great efforts have been made in the last 2 decades to define the syndrome. The presence of three different definitions for the diagnosis of PCOS reflects the phenotypic heterogeneity of the syndrome. Major criteria are required for the diagnosis, which in turn identifies different phenotypes according to the combination of different criteria. In addition, the relevant impact of metabolic issues, specifically insulin resistance and obesity, on the pathogenesis of PCOS, and the susceptibility to develop earlier than expected glucose intolerance states, including type 2 diabetes, has supported the notion that these aspects should be considered when defining the PCOS phenotype and planning potential therapeutic strategies in an affected subject. This paper offers a critical endocrine and European perspective on the debate on the definition of PCOS and summarises all major aspects related to aetiological factors, including early life events, potentially involved in the development of the disorder. Diagnostic tools of PCOS are also discussed, with emphasis on the laboratory evaluation of androgens and other potential biomarkers of ovarian and metabolic dysfunctions. We have also paid specific attention to the role of obesity, sleep disorders and neuropsychological aspects of PCOS and on the relevant pathogenetic aspects of cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, we have discussed how to target treatment choices based according to the phenotype and individual patient's needs. Finally, we have suggested potential areas of translational and clinical research for the future with specific emphasis on hormonal and metabolic aspects of PCOS.;;"University of London; University College London; University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Universite de Lille; CHU Lille; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Athens Medical School; Universidad de Alcala; Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERDEM; Imperial College London; University of Bologna; IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna; Erciyes University; University of Belgrade; University Medical Centre Ljubljana; University of Ljubljana; Universidade do Porto; Sao Joao Hospital; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); CHU Lyon; Hacettepe University";;;;;;;;;;441;510;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2014;171;4;;;;;P1;P29;;10.1530/EJE-14-0253;http://dx.doi.org/10.1530/EJE-14-0253;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000343671500002;View Full Record in Web of Science

The variety of metabolic illnesses can be addressed through personalized medicine. The goal of personalized medicine is to give doctors the ability to anticipate the best course of treatment for patients with metabolic problems. By analyzing a patient's metabolomic, proteomic, genetic profile, and clinical data, physicians can identify relevant diagnostic, and predictive biomarkers and develop treatment plans and therapy for acute and chronic metabolic diseases. To achieve this goal, real-time modeling of clinical data and multiple omics is essential to pinpoint underlying biological mechanisms, risk factors, and possibly useful data to promote early diagnosis and prevention of complex diseases. Incorporating cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning is crucial for consolidating diverse forms of data, examining multiple variables, establishing databases of clinical indicators to aid decision-making, and formulating ethical protocols to address concerns.

Metabolic disrupting chemicals with short half-lives, such as those of halogenated structure (trihalomethanes, THM) have been linked with hepatic insulin resistance phenomena in animal studies. However, human studies evaluating the role of THM exposure on liver pathogenesis and T2DM disease process are scarce. The objectives of this study were to: i) determine the association of urinary brominated THM (BrTHM) levels and T2DM disease status, and ii) investigate the association between urinary BrTHM levels and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)-concentrations, often used as surrogate markers of NAFLD. A pilot case-control study was conducted in Nicosia, Cyprus (n = 95). Cases were physician-diagnosed T2DM patients and controls were healthy individuals. Liver enzymes, leptin and TNF-alpha were measured in sera, while urinary THM levels were measured using tandem mass spectrometry. Diabetics had higher levels of serum leptin, body mass index and ALT than the controls. Among all study participants those with serum ALT levels above the median (17 IU/L) had higher mean tribromomethane (TBM) concentrations compared to those with serum ALT below 17 IU/L. A significant increase in the odds of having above the median serum ALT levels [OR 6.38, 95%. CI: 1.11,42.84 (p = 0.044)] was observed for each unit increase in creatinine-unadjusted urinary TBM levels, along with BMI and past smoking, after adjusting for possible confounders, such as urinary creatinine, age, sex, and leptin; no other THM compound showed a significant association with serum ALT. Logistic regression models for T2DM using the urinary BrTHM as exposure variables did not reach the predetermined level of significance. The interplay between exposures to BrTHM and the initiation of key pathophysiological events relating to hepatic injury (ALT) and inflammation (leptin) was recognized via the use of selected biomarkers of effect. Our evidence that THM could act as hepatic toxins with a further initiation of diabetogenic effects call for additional studies to help us better understand the disease process. of the two co-morbidities (NAFLD and T2DM).

Plasma levels of triosephosphate isomerase (TPI1, a protein involved in the glycolytic pathway) decreased in type 2 diabetes cases (fold change = 1.37, P = 0.002). The effect of miR-193b-3p on TPI1 was verified by transfection of miR-193b-3p into HepG2 cells. miR-193b-3p inhibited the expression of YWHAZ/14-3-3 zeta in the PI3K-AKT pathway, subsequently altering the expression of FOXO1 and PCK1. After transfection, cells were incubated in glucose-free medium for another 4 h. Glucose levels in medium from cells with elevated miR-193b-3p levels were significantly higher than those in medium from negative control cells (P = 0.016). In addition, elevated miR-193b-3p reduced glucose uptake by inhibiting insulin receptor (IR) and GLUT2 expression. ConclusionPlasma miR-193b-3p levels increased in type 2 diabetes cases, and TPI1 levels decreased in both plasma and HepG2 cells with increased miR-193b-3p levels, while extracellular lactate levels did not significantly changed. Moreover, miR-193b-3p may affect glucose metabolism by directly targeting YWHAZ/14-3-3 zeta and upregulating the transcription factor FOXO1 downstream of the PI3K-AKT pathway.;;"Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Huazhong University of Science & Technology; Dongfeng Motor; Hubei University of Medicine";;;;;;;;;;10;10;;;;;;;;;;;MAY 27;2022;13;;;;;;;;814347;10.3389/fendo.2022.814347;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2022.814347;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000811332500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: Three hundred ninety (390) age-matched subjects were divided into 8 groups depending upon duration of diabetes and the severity of renal damage. Urinary proteome profile of all subjects was determined with the help of microfluidic array. Participants with similar profile were further selected to study proteome map of urinary low molecular weight proteins with the help of 2 dimensional gel electrophoresis. Results: Out of 390 total patients 268 patients showed a similar one dimensional proteomic pattern. Further, two-dimensional urinary proteomic pattern of these patients with molecular weight<50kDa was studied. Eight proteins with molecular weight 11, 15, 17, 23, 34, 38 and 46kDa were identified with MALDI-QTOF. These low molecular weight proteins showed gradual increase in urinary excretion along with the duration of diabetes and severity of renal damage. Conclusion: The study concludes that proteomic analysis might be a useful tool for detecting some novel markers capable of detecting patients susceptible to diabetic nephropathy in the early phase.;;Charotar University of Science & Technology - Charusat;;;;;;;;;;10;12;;;;;;;;;;;MAY 17;2019;11;;;;;;;;39;10.1186/s13098-019-0430-1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13098-019-0430-1;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000468322900002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods In this study, we used data from non-targeted metabolomics performed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in three Swedish cohorts (Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men [ULSAM], n = 1138; Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors [PIVUS], n = 970; TwinGene, n = 1630). Metabolites associated with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or prevalent type 2 diabetes were assessed for associations with incident type 2 diabetes in the three cohorts followed by replication attempts in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) S4 cohort (n = 855). Assessment of the association of metabolite-regulating genetic variants with type 2 diabetes was done using data from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies. Results Out of 5961 investigated metabolic features, 1120 were associated with prevalent type 2 diabetes and IFG and 70 were annotated to metabolites and replicated in the three cohorts. Fifteen metabolites were associated with incident type 2 diabetes in the four cohorts combined (358 events) following adjustment for age, sex, BMI, waist circumference and fasting glucose. Novel findings included associations of higher values of the bile acid deoxycholic acid and monoacylglyceride 18:2 and lower concentrations of cortisol with type 2 diabetes risk. However, adding metabolites to an existing risk score improved model fit only marginally. A genetic variant within the CYP7A1 locus, encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, was found to be associated with lower concentrations of deoxycholic acid, higher concentrations of LDL-cholesterol and lower type 2 diabetes risk. Variants in or near SGPP1, GCKR and FADS1/2 were associated with diabetes-associated phospholipids and type 2 diabetes. Conclusions/interpretation We found evidence that the metabolism of bile acids and phospholipids shares some common genetic origin with type 2 diabetes.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that strongly increases the risk of severe vascular diseases. This study compared changes in proteins of the cerebral cortex during ischemic brain injury between nondiabetic and diabetic animals. Methods: Adult male rats were injected with streptozotocin (40 mg/kg) via the intraperitoneal route to induce diabetes and underwent surgical middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) 4 wk after streptozotocin treatment. Cerebral cortex tissues were collected 24 h after MCAO and cerebral cortex proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Results: Several proteins were identified as differentially expressed between nondiabetic and diabetic animals. Among the identified proteins, we focused on the following metabolism-related enzymes: isocitrate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, adenosylhomocysteinase, pyruvate kinase, and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (neuroleukin). Expression of these proteins was decreased in animals that underwent MCAO. Moreover, protein expression was reduced to a greater extent in diabetic animals than in nondiabetic animals. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that the diabetic condition exacerbates the decrease in expression of metabolism-related proteins after MCAO. Conclusions: These results suggest that the diabetic condition may exacerbate brain damage during focal cerebral ischemia through the downregulation of metabolism-related proteins.

This study aims to propose a machine learning model for DR early diagnosis using metabolomics and clinical indicators. Methods From 2017 to 2018, 950 participants were enrolled from two affiliated hospitals of Wenzhou Medical University and Anhui Medical University. A total of 69 matched blocks including healthy volunteers, type 2 diabetes, and DR patients were obtained from a propensity score matching-based metabolomics study. UPLC-ESI-MS/MS system was utilized for serum metabolic fingerprint data. CART decision trees (DT) were used to identify the potential biomarkers. Finally, the nomogram model was developed using the multivariable conditional logistic regression models. The calibration curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, receiver operating characteristic curve, and decision curve analysis were applied to evaluate the performance of this predictive model. Results The mean age of enrolled subjects was 56.7 years with a standard deviation of 9.2, and 61.4% were males. Based on the DT model, 2-pyrrolidone completely separated healthy controls from diabetic patients, and thiamine triphosphate (ThTP) might be a principal metabolite for DR detection. The developed nomogram model (including diabetes duration, systolic blood pressure and ThTP) shows an excellent quality of classification, with AUCs (95% CI) of 0.99 (0.97-1.00) and 0.99 (0.95-1.00) in training and testing sets, respectively. Furthermore, the predictive model also has a reasonable degree of calibration. Conclusions The nomogram presents an accurate and favorable prediction for DR detection.

This study investigated the site-specific reaction of glyoxal and methylglyoxal with the amino acid residues on human hemoglobin using a shot-gun proteomic approach with nanoflow liquid chromatography/nanospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS). In human hemoglobin incubated with glyoxal, modification on 8 different sites, including lysine residues at alpha-Lys-11, alpha-Lys-16, alpha-Lys-56, beta-Lys-17, beta-Lys-66, beta-Lys-144, and arginine residues at alpha-Arg-92 and beta-Arg-30, was observed using a data-dependent scan. In methylglyoxal-treated hemoglobin, there were specific residues, namely, alpha-Arg-92, beta-Lys-66, beta-Arg-30, and beta-Lys-144, forming carboxyethylation as well as the dehydrated product hydroimidazolone at alpha-Arg-92 and beta-Arg-30. These lysine and arginine modifications were confirmed by accurate mass measurement and the MS2 and MS' spectra. The most intensive signal of each modified peptide was used as the precursor ion to perform the product ion scan. The relative extent of modifications was semiquantified simultaneously relative to the native reference peptide by nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS under the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The extent of these modifications increased dose-dependently with increasing concentrations of glyoxal or methylglyoxal. Six out of the eight modifications induced by glyoxal and three out of the six modifications induced by methylglyoxal were detected in hemoglobin freshly isolated from human blood samples. The relative extent of modification of these post-translational modifications was quantified in poorly controlled type 2, diabetes mellitus patients (n = 20) and in nondiabetic control subjects (n = 21). The results show that the carboxymethylated peptides at alpha-Lys-16, alpha-Arg-92, beta-Lys-17, beta-Lys-66, and the peptide at alpha-Arg-92 with methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone are significantly higher in diabetic patients than in normal individuals (p value <0.05). This report identified and quantified glyoxal- and methylglyoxal-modified hemoglobin peptides in humans and revealed the association of the extent of modifications at specific sites with T2DM. Only one drop (10 mu L) of fresh blood is needed for this assay, and only an equivalent of 1 mu g of hemoglobin was analyzed by the nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS-SRM system. These results suggest the potential use of these specific post-translational modifications in hemoglobin as feasible biomarker candidates to assess protein damage induced by glyoxal and methylglyoxal.;;"National Chung Cheng University; Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital; Dalin Tzu Chi Hospital";;;;;;;;;;33;37;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2015;28;12;;;;;2377;2389;;10.1021/acs.chemrestox.5b00380;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.5b00380;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000367118000015;View Full Record in Web of Science

We sought to identify proteomic markers of undetected dysglycaemia (impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes mellitus) to improve the identification of patients at highest risk for diabetes. Materials and methods: In this prospective cohort, 626 patients without known diabetes underwent oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) during admission for MI. Proximity extension assay was used to measure 81 biomarkers. Multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for risk factors, was used to evaluate the association of biomarkers with dysglycaemia. Subsequently, lasso regression was performed in a 2/3 training set to identify proteomic biomarkers with prognostic value for dysglycaemia, when added to risk factors, fasting plasma glucose, and glycated haemoglobin A1c. Determination of discriminatory ability was performed in a 1/3 test set. Results: In total, 401/626 patients (64.1%) met the criteria for dysglycaemia. Using multivariable logistic regression, cathepsin D had the strongest association with dysglycaemia. Lasso regression selected seven markers, including cathepsin D, that improved prediction of dysglycaemia (area under the receiver operator curve [AUC] 0.848 increased to 0.863). In patients with normal fasting plasma glucose, only cathepsin D was selected (AUC 0.699 increased to 0.704). Conclusions: Newly detected dysglycaemia, including manifest diabetes, is common in patients with acute MI. Cathepsin D improved the prediction of dysglycaemia, which may be helpful in the a priori risk determination of diabetes as a motivation for confirmatory OGTT.;;"Orebro University; Uppsala University; Uppsala University; SciLifeLab; Uppsala University; Uppsala University; Vasteras Central Hospital; Karolinska Institutet; Dalarna University; Vasteras Central Hospital";;;;;;;;;;1;2;;;;;;;;;;;JUL 3;2019;124;3;;;;;187;192;;10.1080/03009734.2019.1650141;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03009734.2019.1650141;;AUG 2019;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000482489400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

We studied alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST) in subjects randomized to placebo who completed assessments over 36 mo in a cardiovascular outcome trial [the Stabilisation of Atherosclerotic Plaque by Initiation of Darapladib Therapy (STABILITY) trial; n = 4,264; mean age: 64.2 yr] or over 12 mo in three trials that enrolled only subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) [the DIA trials; n = 308; mean age: 62.4 yr] to investigate time-dependent relationships and the factors that might affect ALT and AST, including body mass index (BMI), T2D, and renal function. Multivariate linear mixed models examined time-dependent relationships between liver enzyme concentrations as response variables and BMI, baseline T2D status, hemoglobin A(1c) levels, and renal function, as explanatory variables. At baseline, ALT was higher in individuals who were men, <65 yr old, and obese and who had glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >60 ml.min(-1).1.73 m(-2). ALT was not significantly associated with T2D at baseline, although it was positively associated with HbA(1c). GFR had a greater impact on ALT than T2D. ALT concentrations decreased over time in subjects who lost weight but remained stable in individuals with increasing BMI. Weight change did not alter AST concentrations. We provide new insights on the influence of time, GFR, and HbA(1c) on ALT and AST concentrations and confirm the effect of sex, age, T2D, BMI, and BMI change in subjects receiving placebo in clinical trials. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Clinical trials provide high-quality data on liver enzyme concentrations from subjects randomized to placebo that can be used to investigate the epidemiology of these biomarkers. The adjusted models show the influence of sex, age, time, renal function, type 2 diabetes, HbA(1c), and body mass index on alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations and their relative importance.

Therefore, we aimed to determine whether acylcarnitines could independently predict type 2 diabetes by using a targeted metabolic profiling approach. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A population-based prospective study was conducted among 2,103 community-living Chinese individuals aged 50-70 years from Beijing and Shanghai with a mean follow-up duration of 6 years. Fasting glucose, glycohemoglobin, and insulin were determined at baseline and in a follow-up survey. Baseline plasma acylcarnitines were profiled by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS Over the 6-year period, 507 participants developed diabetes. A panel of acylcanitines, especially with long chain, was significantly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The relative risks of type 2 diabetes per SD increase of the predictive model score were 2.48 (95% CI 2.20-2.78) for the conventional and 9.41 (95% CI 7.62-11.62) for the full model including acylcarnitines, respectively. Moreover, adding selected acylcarnitines substantially improved predictive ability for incident diabetes, as area under the receiver operator characteristic curve improved to 0.89 in the full model compared with 0.73 in the conventional model. Similar associations were obtained when the predictive models were established separately among Beijing or Shanghai residents. CONCLUSIONS A panel of acylcarnitines, mainly involving mitochondrial lipid dysregulation, significantly improved predictive ability for type 2 diabetes beyond conventional risk factors.

A number of well-characterised cardiovascular risk factors which contribute to the development of the majority of cardiovascular events have been identified, including dyslipidaemia, hypertension and diabetes. Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a 3- to 5-fold increased risk for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). They may have a cluster of haemostatic abnormalities, including elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and fibrinogen, which contribute to acute thrombotic events. It is clear that additional unidentified risk factors contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular events, and so the search for novel biomarkers and effectors, particularly in individuals with T2DM, remains a major challenge of cardiovascular medicine. Plasma and cellular proteins which contribute to thrombus formation have the potential to confer a pro-thrombotic state and represent a link between genotype, environment and disease phenotype. The comprehensive analysis of these proteins is now increasingly facilitated through the continued development of proteomic technologies which provide multifaceted approaches to the identification of novel biomarkers and/or effectors of thrombus formation and on which future anticoagulant and thrombolytic therapies may be based. This review provides an overview of current proteomic technologies. It focuses on the recent studies in which these technologies have been applied in the search for novel proteins that may confer increased risk of acute cardiovascular diseases and therefore that may influence disease progression and therapy.;;University of Leeds;;;;;;;;;;14;17;;;;;;;;;;;SEP;2008;5;3;;;;;205;212;;10.3132/dvdr.2008.033;http://dx.doi.org/10.3132/dvdr.2008.033;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000261639900009;View Full Record in Web of Science

In skeletal muscle fibres, energy for contraction is supplied by adenosine triphosphate via anaerobic glycolysis, the phosphocreatine shuttle and oxidative phosphorylation. In this respect, the anaerobic glycolytic pathway supports short duration performances of contractile tissues of high intensity. The catalytic elements associated with glycolysis are altered during development, muscle differentiation, physiological adaptations and many pathological mechanisms, such as muscular dystrophy, diabetes mellitus and age-related muscle weakness. Although gel electrophoresis-based proteomics is afflicted with various biological and technical problems, it is an ideal analytical tool for studying the abundant and mostly soluble enzymes that constitute the glycolytic system. This review critically examines the proteomic findings of recent large-scale studies of glycolytic enzymes and associated components in normal, transforming and degenerating muscle tissues. In the long term, proteins belonging to the glycolytic pathway may be useful as biomarkers of muscle adaptations and pathophysiological mechanisms and can be employed to improve diagnostics and in the identification of novel therapeutic targets in neuromuscular disorders.

Disease severity may be associated with a metabolic imbalance related to amino acids, lipids, and energy-generating pathways. The aim of this study was to characterize the profile of amino acids and acylcarnitines in COVID-19 patients. A multicenter, cross-sectional study was carried out. A total of 453 individuals were classified by disease severity. Levels of 11 amino acids, 31 acylcarnitines, and succinylacetone in serum samples were analyzed by electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Different clusters were observed in partial least squares discriminant analysis, with phenylalanine, alanine, citrulline, proline, and succinylacetone providing the major contribution to the variability in each cluster (variable importance in the projection >1.5). In logistic models adjusted by age, sex, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and nutritional status, phenylalanine was associated with critical outcomes (odds ratio=5.3 (95% CI 3.16-9.2) in the severe vs. critical model, with an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.77-0.90). In conclusion the metabolic imbalance in COVID-19 patients might affect disease progression. This work shows an association of phenylalanine with critical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, highlighting phenylalanine as a potential metabolic biomarker of disease severity.;;"Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran - Mexico; Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico; Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico; National Institute of Cardiology - Mexico; National Institute of Cardiology - Mexico; National Institute of Cardiology - Mexico; National Institute of Cardiology - Mexico; Universidad Anahuac; Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran - Mexico";;;;;;;;;;18;18;;;;;;;;;;;JUL 11;2022;13;;;;;;;;936106;10.3389/fimmu.2022.936106;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.936106;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000880077100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Further analysis with heat maps identified two potential proteins with the highest folding alterations in urine. V-ATPase subunit C 1 abundance was significantly inversely correlated with microalbumin and significantly decreased in urine, whereas increased IKBIP was positively correlated with microalbumin. The level of those proteins was significantly different among the control, T2DM, and DN groups, implying an association with the progression of DN.Conclusions: The present findings of our study indicate that the decreasing V-ATPase subunit C 1 together with increasing IKBIP in urine, were found to be closely associated with DN complications and signifying their value as biomarkers for predicting the risk of DN at initial diagnosis.";;"Universitas Padjadjaran; Clinical Laboratory Prodia; Universitas Padjadjaran; Universitas Padjadjaran";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;SEP;2023;203;;;;;;;;110887;10.1016/j.diabres.2023.110887;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2023.110887;;AUG 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001067711300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we sought to identify possible metabolites related to diabetic nephropathy among urinary eicosanoids and related mediators. Using liquid chromatogram-tandem mass spectrometry, we optimized the lipid extraction from urine using the Monospin C18 as a solid-phase extraction cartridge and measured the urinary lipid mediators in 111 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as 33 healthy subjects. We observed that 14 metabolites differed significantly among the clinical stages of nephropathy. Among them, levels of tetranor-prostaglandin E metabolite (tetranor-PGEM), an arachidonic acid metabolite, were significantly higher in subjects with stage 1 nephropathy than in healthy subjects and increased with the progression of nephropathy. We also observed that levels of maresin-1, a docosahexaenoic acid metabolite, and leukotriene B4-ethanolamide, an arachidonoyl ethanolamide metabolite, were significantly lower in subjects with stage 3-4 nephropathy than in healthy subjects and those with stage 1-2 nephropathy. Finally, using a comprehensive analysis of urinary eicosanoids and related mediators, we concluded that tetranor-PGEM was capable of discriminating clinical stages of nephropathy and thus useful as a novel biomarker for diabetic nephropathy.;;"University of Tokyo; Institute of Science Tokyo; Tokyo Medical & Dental University (TMDU); University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo";;;;;;;;;;11;12;;;;;;;;;;;;2021;62;;;;;;;;100120;10.1016/j.jlr.2021.100120;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jlr.2021.100120;;OCT 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000709953200012;View Full Record in Web of Science

With the emergence of high-throughput proteomics technology, the identification of novel protein factors involved in disease processes has been decisively improved. This review outlines the usefulness of the proteomic profiling of animal disease models for the discovery of new reliable biomarkers, for the optimization of diagnostic procedures and the development of new treatment options for skeletal muscle disorders. Since inbred animal strains show genetically much less interindividual differences as compared to human patients, considerably lower experimental repeats are capable of producing meaningful proteomic data. Thus, animal model proteomics can be conveniently employed for both studying basic mechanisms of molecular pathogenesis and the effects of drugs, genetic modifications or cell-based therapies on disease progression. Based on the results from comparative animal proteomics, a more informed decision on the design of clinical proteomics studies could be reached. Since no one animal model represents a perfect pathobiochemical replica of all of the symptoms seen in complex human disorders, the proteomic screening of novel animal models can also be employed for swift and enhanced protein biochemical phenotyping.;;;;;;;;;;;;34;36;;;;;;;;;;;SEP;2007;1;9;;;;;1169;1184;;10.1002/prca.200700042;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prca.200700042;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000249635500021;View Full Record in Web of Science

Early detection of progression to micro and macroalbuminuria may facilitate prevention and treatment of renal diseases. We aimed to develop plasma proteomics classifiers to predict the development of micro or macroalbuminuria in hypertension or type 2 diabetes.Methods:Patients with hypertension (n=125) and type 2 diabetes (n=82) were selected for this case-control study from the Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd-stage Disease cohort and the Steno Diabetes Center. Cases transitioned from normo to microalbuminuria, or from micro to macroalbuminuria. Controls, matched for age, sex, and baseline albuminuria stage, did not transition. Follow-up was 3.00.9 years. Plasma proteomics profiles were measured by liquid chromatography-electrospray-trap mass-spectrometry. Classifiers were developed and cross-validated for prediction of transition in albuminuria stage. Improvement in risk prediction was tested on top of a reference model of baseline albuminuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system intervention.Results:In hypertensive patients, the classifier improved risk prediction for transition in albuminuria stage on top of the reference model (C-index from 0.69 to 0.78; P<0.01). In type 2 diabetes, the classifier improved risk prediction for transition from micro to macroalbuminuria (C-index from 0.73 to 0.80; P=0.04). In both diseases, the identified peptides were linked to pathways recognized to contribute to nephropathy, including fibrosis, inflammation, angiogenesis, and mineral metabolism.Conclusions:Plasma proteomics predict the transition in albuminuria stage beyond established renal risk markers in hypertension or type 2 diabetes.

The Consortium aims to discover and validate biomarkers that: (1) predict the rate of glycaemic deterioration before and after type 2 diabetes onset; (2) predict the response to diabetes therapies; and (3) help stratify type 2 diabetes into clearly definable disease subclasses that can be treated more effectively than without stratification. This paper describes two new prospective cohort studies conducted as part of DIRECT. Methods Prediabetic participants (target sample size 2,200-2,700) and patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (target sample size similar to 1,000) are undergoing detailed metabolic phenotyping at baseline and 18 months and 36 months later. Abdominal, pancreatic and liver fat is assessed using MRI. Insulin secretion and action are assessed using frequently sampled OGTTs in non-diabetic participants, and frequently sampled mixed-meal tolerance tests in patients with type 2 diabetes. Biosamples include venous blood, faeces, urine and nail clippings, which, among other biochemical analyses, will be characterised at genetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic and metagenomic levels. Lifestyle is assessed using high-resolution triaxial accelerometry, 24 h diet record, and food habit questionnaires.

In this study, the salivary glycopatterns from 130 of healthy volunteers (HV), 139 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 167 patients with DVC were case-by-case analyzed by using lectin microarrays. Subsequently, diagnostic models were developed using logistic regression and machine learning algorithms based on the data of lectin microarrays in training set. The performance of diagnostic models was evaluated in an independent blind cohort. The results of lectin microarrays indicated that the glycopatterns identified by 16 lectins (e.g. BS-I, PWM and EEL) were significantly altered in DVC patients compared with patients with T2DM, which suggested the alterations in salivary glycopatterns could reflect onset of DVC. Notably, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model exhibited better performance for distinguishing DVC (accuracy: 0.939) than other models in blind cohort. The integrated classifier, which combined three machine learning models, exhibited a higher overall accuracy (>= 0.933) than other models in blind cohort.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the human salivary proteome in type-2 diabetes to identify potential biomarkers of diabetes. Whole saliva from control and type-2 diabetic individuals was characterized by multidimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS). Label-free quantification was used to identify differentially abundant protein biomarkers. Selected potential biomarkers were then independently validated in saliva from control, diabetic, and prediabetic subjects by Western immunoblotting and ELISA. Characterization of the salivary proteome identified a total of 487 unique proteins. Approximately 33% of these have not been previously reported in human saliva. Of these, 65 demonstrated a greater than 2-fold difference in abundance between control and type-2 diabetes samples. A majority of the differentially abundant proteins belong to pathways regulating metabolism and immune response. Independent validation of a subset of potential biomarkers utilizing immunodetection confirmed their differential expression in type-2 diabetes, and analysis of prediabetic samples demonstrated a trend of relative increase in their abundance with progression from the prediabetic to the diabetic state. This comprehensive proteomic analysis of the human salivary proteome in type-2 diabetes provides the first global view of potential mechanisms perturbed in diabetic saliva and their utility in detection and monitoring of diabetes. Further characterization of these markers in a larger cohort of subjects may provide the basis for new, noninvasive tests for diabetes screening, detection, and monitoring.;;"Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences; Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences";;;;;;;;;;190;219;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2009;8;1;;;SI;;239;245;;10.1021/pr8003776;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr8003776;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000262171100025;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between G0S2 and insulin resistance remain incompletely understood. Our study aimed to confirm the effect of G0S2 on insulin resistance, and determine whether the insulin resistance in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) results from G0S2 elevation. MethodsIn this study, we extracted livers from mice that consumed HFD and received tail vein injections of AD-G0S2/Ad-LacZ, and performed a proteomics analysis. ResultsProteomic analysis revealed that there was a total of 125 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) (56 increased and 69 decreased proteins) among the identified 3583 proteins. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that four insulin signaling pathway-associated proteins were significantly upregulated and five insulin signaling pathway -associated proteins were significantly downregulated. ConclusionThese findings show that the DEPs, which were associated with insulin resistance, are generally consistent with enhanced insulin resistance in G0S2 overexpression mice. Collectively, this study demonstrates that G0S2 may be a potential target gene for the treatment of obesity, NAFLD, and diabetes.;;"Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences";;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;MAR 23;2023;14;;;;;;;;1130350;10.3389/fendo.2023.1130350;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2023.1130350;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000963252300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In the general population, plasma lipidomic analysis can identify individuals at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether circulating lipid levels 12 weeks following a GDM pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Methods Plasma lipid profiles containing > 300 lipids were measured in 104 normal glucose-tolerant women 12 weeks following an index GDM pregnancy using electrospray-ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Women were assessed for 10 years for development of overt type 2 diabetes. Results Among the 104 women with previous GDM, 21 (20%) developed diabetes during the median follow-up period of 8.5 years. Three lipid species, the cholesteryl ester species CE 20:4, the alkenylphosphatidylethanolamine species PE(P-36:2) and the phosphatidylserine species PS 38:4, were independently and positively associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. In a clinical model of prediction of type 2 diabetes that included age, BMI, and levels of pregnancy fasting glucose, postnatal fasting glucose, triacylglycerol and total cholesterol, the addition of these three lipid species resulted in an improvement in the net reclassification index of 22.3%. Conclusions/interpretation The lipid species CE 20:4, PE(P-36:2) and PS 38:4 were significant risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes in women with a previous history of GDM.

Methods: Clinically cognitively normal T2DM individuals were recruited (NCT04455867). Depressive symptom severity was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; total scores <= 13 indicated minimal depressive symptoms and >= 14 indicated significant depressive symptoms). Executive function and verbal memory were assessed. Fasting serum oxylipins were quantified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. Results: The study included 85 participants with minimal depressive symptoms and 27 with significant symptoms (mean age: 63.3 +/- 9.8 years, 49 % women). In all participants, higher concentrations of linoleic acid derived sEH (12,13-dihydroxyoctadecamonoenoic acid; DiHOME) and CYP450 (12(13)-epoxyoctadecamonoenoic acid; EpOME) metabolites were associated with poorer executive function (F-1,F-101 = 6.094, p = 0.015 and F-1,F-101 = 5.598, p = 0.020, respectively).

PTMs apply a dynamic control of proteins in both physiological and pathological conditions. The study of disease-specific PTMs allows identifying potential biomarkers and developing effective drugs. Enrichment techniques combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS)/MS analysis provide attractive results on PTM characterization. Selected reaction monitoring/multiple reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) is a powerful targeted assay for the quantitation and validation of PTMs in complex biological samples.Areas covered: The most frequent PTMs are described in terms of biological role and analytical methods commonly used to detect them. The applications of SRM/MRM for the absolute quantitation of PTMs are reported, and a specific section is focused on PTM detection in proteins that are involved in the cardiovascular system and heart diseases.Expert commentary: PTM characterization in relation to disease pathology is still in progress, but targeted proteomics by LC-MS/MS has significantly upgraded our knowledge in the last few years. Advances in enrichment strategies and software tools will facilitate the interpretation of high PTM complexity. Promising studies confirm the great potential of SRM/MRM to study PTMs in the cardiovascular field, and PTMomics could be very useful in the clinical perspective.;;IRCCS Centro Cardiologico Monzino;;;;;;;;;;12;13;;;;;;;;;;;;2018;15;6;;;;;477;502;;10.1080/14789450.2018.1484283;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14789450.2018.1484283;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000437193400003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Proteins are major targets for oxidation reactions, because of their rapid reaction rates with oxidants and their high abundance in cells, extracellular tissues, and body fluids. Additionally, oxidative stress is able to degrade lipids and carbohydrates to highly reactive intermediates, which eventually attack proteins at various functional sites. Consequently, a wide variety of distinct posttranslational protein modifications is formed by protein oxidation, glycoxidation, and lipoxidation. Reversible modifications are relevant in physiological processes and constitute signaling mechanisms (?redox signaling?), while non-reversible modifications may contribute to pathological situations and several diseases. A rising number of publications provide evidence for their involvement in the onset and progression of diseases as well as aging processes. Certain protein oxidation products are chemically stable and formed in large quantity, which makes them promising candidates to become biomarkers of oxidative damage. Moreover, progress in the development of detection and quantification methods facilitates analysis time and effort and contributes to their future applicability in clinical routine. The present review outlines the most important classes and selected examples of oxidative protein modifications, elucidates the chemistry beyond their formation and discusses available methods for detection and analysis. Furthermore, the relevance and potential of protein modifications as biomarkers in the context of disease and aging is summarized.;;"Leibniz Association; Deutsches Institut fur Ernahrungsforschung Potsdam-Rehbrucke (DIfE)";;;;;;;;;;136;147;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2021;42;;;;;;;;101901;10.1016/j.redox.2021.101901;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2021.101901;;APR 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000647722300004;View Full Record in Web of Science

Our study included 8749 Finnish men without diabetes at baseline recruited from the Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) cohort. We used a questionnaire to measure leisure-time PA. Metabolites were measured in 7271 men as a part of Metabolon's untargeted Discovery HD4 platform using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We found 198 metabolites significantly associated with PA. Several of these metabolites were novel including especially steroids, amino acids, imidazoles, carboxylic acids, and hydroxy acids. Increased PA was significantly associated with high levels of choline plasmalogens, lysophosphatidylcholines, polyunsaturated fatty acids, carotenoids, long chain acylcarnitines, imidazoles, bilirubins, aryl sulfates, hydroxy acids, indolepropionate, and indolelactate. Several of these metabolites have been previously associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes and with a healthy diet.

Identifying diagnostic biomarkers for DN at an early stage is crucial due to the considerable societal and economic burden associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) and its risk factors. In the past, early indicators of microvascular problems, such as microalbuminuria (MA), have been used to predict the possibility of developing advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, because of the incapacity of MA to appropriately estimate DN, particularly, non-albuminuric DN, additional markers have been suggested for recognizing the early renal abnormalities and structural lesions, even before MA. This study aims to assess the existing and future biomarkers used to diagnose or predict early DN. This review provides comprehensive insight into diagnostic approaches for early detection of CKD, addressing the following areas: (i) markers of glomerular damage, (ii) markers of tubular damage, (iii) oxidative stress biomarkers, (iv) inflammatory biomarkers and (v) futuristic biomarkers such as micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs), proteomics, metabolomics and genomics and gut microbiota. Early detection of DN may lead to improvement in clinical management and quality of life, emphasizing the importance of identifying a specific and reliable predictive biomarker. Emerging serum and urinary biomarkers offer promise for early DN diagnosis, potentially reducing prevalence and preventing progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Further advancements in miRNAs, proteomics, metabolomics genomics and gut microbiota offer prospects for even earlier and more precise DN diagnosis.;;"Jamia Hamdard University; Jamia Hamdard University";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;;2025;31;8;;;;;619;629;;10.2174/0113816128333694240928161703;http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/0113816128333694240928161703;;OCT 2024;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001338165300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Materials and Methods We extracted clinical and omics data of 482 type 2 diabetes patients from a tertiary hospital consecutively from April 2018 to April 2019. NAFLD was estimated by ultrasound at admission. Plasma fasting n3 and n6 fatty acids were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Restricted cubic spline nested in binary logistic regression was used to select the cut-off point, and estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Additive interactions of the n6 : n3 ratio with insulin action for NAFLD were estimated using relative excess risk due to interaction, attributable proportion due to interaction and synergy index. Relative excess risk due to interaction >0, attributable proportion due to interaction >0 or synergy index >1 indicates biological interaction. Spearman correlation analysis was used to obtain partial correlation coefficients between PUFA and hallmarks of NAFLD. Results Of 482 patients, 313 were with and 169 were without NAFLD. N3 >= 800 and n6 PUFA >= 8,100 mu mol/L were independently associated with increased NAFLD risk; n6 : n3 ratio <= 10 was associated with NAFLD (odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.20-2.71), and the effect size was amplified by high C-peptide (odds ratio 8.89, 95% confidence interval 4.48-17.7) with significant interaction.

We used logistic regression in the cross-sectional analysis (n=1300), and Cox regression accounting for interval-censored data in the longitudinal analysis (n=1143). We further applied two-level growth models to investigate associations with repeatedly measured traits (fasting glucose, 2 h glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-B, HOMA-IR, HbA(1c)), and two-sample Mendelian randomisation analysis to investigate causal associations. Moreover, we built prediction models using priority-Lasso on top of Framingham-Offspring Risk Score components and evaluated the prediction accuracy through AUC.Results We identified 14, 24 and four proteins associated with prevalent prediabetes (i.e. impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose), prevalent newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and incident type 2 diabetes, respectively (28 overlapping proteins). Of these, IL-17D, IL-18 receptor 1, carbonic anhydrase-5A, IL-1 receptor type 2 (IL-1RT2) and matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein were novel candidates. IGF binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and paraoxonase 3 (PON3) were inversely associated while fibroblast growth factor 21 was positively associated with incident type 2 diabetes. LPL was longitudinally linked with change in glucose-related traits, while IGFBP2 and PON3 were linked with changes in both insulin-and glucose-related traits.

Proteasix tool predicted 48 proteases potentially involved in the generation of the 60 most important peptides identified in the urine of DM patients, including metallopeptidases, cathepsins, and calpains. Collectively, our study lightened some biomarkers possibly involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of DKD, suggesting that peptidomics is a valuable tool for identifying the molecular mechanisms underpinning the disease and thus novel therapeutic targets.;;"Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul";;;;;;;;;;27;32;;;;;;;;;;;JAN 27;2020;10;1;;;;;;;1242;10.1038/s41598-020-58067-7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-58067-7;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000559997100019;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, most metabolomic studies are limited to an analysis of plasma metabolites under fasting conditions, rather than the dynamic shift in response to a metabolic challenge. Moreover, metabolomic profiles of peripheral tissues involved in glucose homeostasis are scarce and the transcriptomic regulation of genes involved in BCAA catabolismis partially unknown. This study aimed to identify differences in circulating and skeletal muscle BCAA levels in response to an OGTT in individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) or type 2 diabetes. Additionally, transcription factors involved in the regulation of the BCAA gene set were identified. Methods Plasma and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained from individuals with NGT or type 2 diabetes before and after an OGTT. Plasma and quadricepsmuscles were harvested fromskeletalmuscle-specific Ppargc1a knockout and transgenic mice. BCAA-related metabolites and genes were assessed by LC-MS/MS and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Small interfering RNA and adenovirus-mediated overexpression techniques were used in primary human skeletal muscle cells to study the role of PPARGC1A and ESRRA in the expression of the BCAA gene set. Radiolabelled leucine was used to analyse the impact of oestrogen-related receptor alpha (ERR alpha) knockdown on leucine oxidation. Results Impairments in BCAA catabolism in people with type 2 diabetes under fasting conditions were exacerbated after a glucose load. Branched-chain keto acids were reduced 37-56% after an OGTT in the NGT group, whereas no changes were detected in individuals with type 2 diabetes. These changes were concomitant with a stronger correlation with glucose homeostasis biomarkers and downregulated expression of branched-chain amino acid transaminase 2, branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex subunits and 69% of downstream BCAA-related genes in skeletal muscle. In primary human myotubes overexpressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha, encoded by PPARGC1A), 61% of the analysed BCAA genes were upregulated, while 67% were downregulated in the quadriceps of skeletalmuscle-specific Ppargc1a knockout mice. ESRRA (encoding ERR alpha) silencing completely abrogated the PGC-1 alpha-induced upregulation of BCAA-related genes in primary human myotubes. Conclusions/interpretation Metabolic inflexibility in type 2 diabetes impacts BCAA homeostasis and attenuates the decrease in circulating and skeletal muscle BCAA-related metabolites after a glucose challenge. Transcriptional regulation of BCAA genes in primary human myotubes via PGC-1 alpha is ERR alpha-dependent.;;"Karolinska Institutet; Umea University; University of Basel; Karolinska Institutet; Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Karolinska Institutet; Danderyds Hospital; Karolinska Institutet";;;;;;;;;;21;23;;;;;;;;;;;SEP;2021;64;9;;;;;2077;2091;;10.1007/s00125-021-05481-9;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-021-05481-9;;JUN 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000661758500002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Two AGEs, Ne-(1-carboxymethyl)-L-Lysine (CML) and pentosidine, have been observed to be elevated in subjects suffering from a multitude of chronic disease states, and accumulation of these compounds may be related to the pathophysiology of disease progression and aging. Methods: We describe here the development and validation of a specific and reproducible LC-MS/MS method to quantify CML and pentosidine in human serum with lower limits of quantitation of 75 ng/mL and 5 ng/mL, respectively. The analyte calibration curve exhibited excellent linearity at a range of 0-10 900 ng/mL for CML and 0800 ng/mL for pentosidine. High-low linearity of 5 serum pairs was assessed, with a mean recovery of 103% (range 94-116%) for CML, and 104% (range 97-116%) for pentosidine. Results: Serum concentrations of CML and pentosidine were quantified in 30 control and 30 subjects with chronic renal insufficiency. A significant increase in both analytes was observed in renal failure compared to control subjects (2.1-fold and 8.4-fold, respectively; P<0.001 for both). In a separate cohort of 49 control versus 95 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), serum CML but not serum pentosidine, was significantly elevated in the T2DM patients, and CML was also correlated with glycemic control, as assessed by hemoglobin A1c (r = 0.34, P<0.001). Conclusions: These mass spectroscopy-based assays for serum CML and pentosidine should be useful in accurately evaluating circulating levels of these key AGEs in various disease states.";;Mayo Clinic;;;;;;;;;;9;10;;;;;;;;;;;MAY;2020;5;3;;;;;558;568;;10.1093/jalm/jfaa023;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jalm/jfaa023;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000531084500012;View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: A nested case-control design was applied with 440 cases of incident T2D and 440 controls, randomly sampled from all 65-75 year-old study participants of the ESTHER study, which is a population-based German cohort study with 14 years of follow-up. Analyses of 8-hydroxy-2 '-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGuo; DNA oxidation product) and 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-oxo-Guo; RNA oxidation product) were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The sum of the two OxGuo molecule concentrations was calculated and called OxGuo-UPLC-MS/MS. The corresponding OxGuo-ELISA levels were measured by Cayman's DNA/RNA oxidative damage ELISA, which detects a mix of 8-oxo-dGuo, 8-oxo-Guo and one other OxGuo molecule. Logistic regression was applied and models were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, HbA1c, and C-reactive protein levels. Results: 8-oxo-dGuo and 8-oxo-Guo were highly correlated with each other (r = 0.642) and weakly correlated with OxGuo-ELISA (r = 0.22 and r = 0.14, respectively). OxGuo-ELISA levels were statistically significant associated with T2D incidence (odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval [95%CI] for comparison of top and bottom quartile: 1.77 [1.14; 2.76]). In contrast, the ORs did not increase stepwise from quartile 2 to 4 for neither 8-oxo-Guo, 8-oxo-dGuo levels nor OxGuo-UPLC-MS/MS and comparisons of top and bottom quartile were not statistically significant. In a post-hoc analysis comparing bottom quartile 1 with a combined group of quartile 2-4, the association of OxGuo-UPLC-MS/MS with T2D incidence reached statistical significance (OR [95%CI]: 0.66 [0.46; 0.96]) and was very similar with the one obtained for OxGuo-ELISA (OR [95%CI]: 0.66 [0.45; 0.95]). Conclusions: Although only the measurements of the DNA/RNA oxidative damage ELISA kit of Cayman were statistically significantly associated with T2D incidence in the main analysis, confidence intervals overlapped and the post-hoc analysis showed that results for OxGuo-UPLC-MS/MS were quite comparable.";;"Helmholtz Association; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ); Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Copenhagen; Bispebjerg Hospital; University of Copenhagen; Bispebjerg Hospital; University of Copenhagen";;;;;;;;;;1;2;;;;;;;;;;;APR;2022;183;;;;;;51;59;;10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2022.03.007;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2022.03.007;;MAR 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000790734500005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet not all subjects with T2DM are at equal risk for CVD complications; the challenge lies in identifying those at greatest risk. Therapies directed toward treating conventional risk factors have failed to significantly reduce this residual risk in T2DM patients. Thus newer targets and markers are needed for the development and testing of novel therapies. Herein we review two complementary MS-based approachesmass spectrometric immunoassay (MSIA) and MS/MS as MRMfor the analysis of plasma proteins and PTMs of relevance to T2DM and CVD. Together, these complementary approaches allow for high-throughput monitoring of many PTMs and the absolute quantification of proteins near the low picomolar range. In this review article, we discuss the clinical relevance of the high density lipoprotein (HDL) proteome and Apolipoprotein A-I PTMs to T2DM and CVD as well as provide illustrative MSIA and MRM data on HDL proteins from T2DM patients to provide examples of how these MS approaches can be applied to gain new insight regarding cardiovascular risk factors.

However, it is unclear whether the metabolomic signature is associated with weight loss interventions in obese children with IR. Thirty-six obese children with IR were selected from the weight loss camp (Shenzhen Sunshine Xing Yada health Technology Co., LTD). Clinical parameters were collected before and after weight loss intervention. Targeted metabolomics of plasma samples was performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to the tandem mass spectrometry, and principal component analysis, variable importance in projection, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis were used to obtain the differentially expressed metabolites. Pathway analysis was conducted with the Homo sapiens (HSA) sets in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. We used machine learning algorithms to obtain the potential biomarkers and Spearman correlation analysis to clarify the association between potential biomarkers and clinical parameters. We found that clinical parameters and metabolite clusters were significantly changed in obese children with IR before and after weight loss intervention. Mechanistically, weight loss intervention significantly changed 61 metabolites in obese children with IR. Furthermore, 12 pathways were significantly changed. Moreover, the machine learning algorithm found 6 important potential biomarkers. In addition, these potential biomarkers were strongly associated with major clinical parameters. These data indicate different metabolomic profiles in obese children with IR after weight loss intervention, providing insights into the clinical parameters and metabolite mechanisms involved in weight loss programs.;;"Guangzhou Sport University; Guangzhou Sport University; Soochow University - China; Harbin Institute of Technology; Zhongkai University of Agriculture & Engineering";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;AUG 30;2024;56;1;;;;;;;54;10.1007/s00726-024-03409-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-024-03409-2;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001302522100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

OBJECTIVE To develop protein risk scores for ASCVD risk prediction and compare them to clinical risk factors and polygenic risk scores in primary and secondary event populations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The primary analysis was a retrospective study of primary events among 13540 individuals in Iceland (aged 40-75 years) with proteomics data and no history of major ASCVD events at recruitment (study duration, August 23, 2000 until October 26, 2006; follow-up through 2018). We also analyzed a secondary event population from a randomized, double-blind lipid-lowering clinical trial (2013-2016), consisting of individuals with stable ASCVD receiving statin therapy and for whom proteomic data were available for 6791 individuals. EXPOSURES Protein risk scores (based on 4963 plasma protein levels and developed in a training set in the primary event population); polygenic risk scores for coronary artery disease and stroke; and clinical risk factors that included age, sex, statin use, hypertension treatment, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and smoking status at the time of plasma sampling. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes were composites of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary heart disease death or cardiovascular death. Performance was evaluated using Cox survival models and measures of discrimination and reclassification that accounted for the competing risk of non-ASCVD death. RESULTS In the primary event population test set (4018 individuals [59.0% women]; 465 events; median follow-up, 15.8 years), the protein risk score had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.93 per SD (95% CI, 1.75 to 2.13). Addition of protein risk score and polygenic risk scores significantly increased the C index when added to a clinical risk factor model (C index change, 0.022 [95% CI, 0.007 to 0.038]). Addition of the protein risk score alone to a clinical risk factor model also led to a significantly increased C index (difference, 0.014 [95% CI, 0.002 to 0.028]). Among White individuals in the secondary event population (6307 participants; 432 events; median follow-up, 2.2 years), the protein risk score had an HR of 1.62 per SD (95% CI, 1.48 to 1.79) and significantly increased C index when added to a clinical risk factor model (C index change, 0.026 [95% CI, 0.011 to 0.042]). The protein risk score was significantly associated with major adverse cardiovascular events among individuals of African and Asian ancestries in the secondary event population. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A protein risk score was significantly associated with ASCVD events in primary and secondary event populations. When added to clinical risk factors, the protein risk score and polygenic risk score both provided statistically significant but modest improvement in discrimination.";;"University of Iceland; Amgen; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Rigshospitalet; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen; University of Copenhagen; Rigshospitalet; Aarhus University; Aarhus University";;;;;;;;;;26;26;;;;;;;;;;;AUG 22;2023;330;8;;;;;725;735;;10.1001/jama.2023.13258;http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2023.13258;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001089326200023;View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite blood pressure control with chronic treatment, a relevant subgroup of patients develop albuminuria. However, the biological factors responsible for albuminuria development and progression are underexplored. We aimed to identify key metabolic targets and biological pathways involved in the negative progression of cardiovascular and renal damage in hypertensives undergoing chronic treatment. A series of 1533 patients were followed for 5 years to investigate the evolution of albuminuria. Patients were classified as: (1) patients with persistent normoalbuminuria; (2) patients developing de novo albuminuria; and (3) patients with maintained albuminuria. At the end of follow-up, urine from 30 nonhypertensive subjects (control group) and a representative cohort of 118 patients was collected for metabolomic analysis. Metabolic patterns of interest were identified in a first discovery phase by nuclear magnetic resonance and further confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Metabolites corresponding to HTN or albuminuria were measured in a prospective study carried out in 35 individuals still in normoalbuminuria, to evaluate their potential as predictors of albuminuria development. Nine metabolites were significantly altered, linking beta-alanine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. The prospective study revealed a panel composed of guanidinoacetate, glutamate, and pantothenate, which was able to predict development of albuminuria. These metabolic signatures open new possibilities in hypertensive therapy and cardiovascular risk control, providing prompt and more efficient intervention, particularly in patients with worse cardiovascular prognosis.";;"Autonomous University of Madrid; Fundacion Jimenez Diaz; Hospital Nacional de Paraplejicos; Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre; Complutense University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid";;;;;;;;;;27;27;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2016;178;;;;;;25;37;;10.1016/j.trsl.2016.07.003;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2016.07.003;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000389106000003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Objectives: This study aimed to identify proteomic markers of the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and their association with type 2 diabetes risk. Methods: We examined the associations between the AHEI and DASH diet quality scores and 1317 plasma proteins in African American participants of the Jackson Heart Study (JHS, n = 1878). These findings were validated in a Singapore Multi-Ethnic Cohort (n = 2395) and examined in relation to type 2 diabetes incidence (n = 539 cases). We adjusted for multiple testing by using false discovery rate-adjusted q values. Results: We identified 13 proteins consistently associated with the AHEI or DASH scores with the strongest associations for the AHEI score and epidermal growth factor receptor (beta:0.089; SE: 0.017; q < 0.001) and for the DASH score and tissue factor (beta:- 0.114; SE: 0.022; q < 0.001). Most of these proteins were related to inflammation, thrombosis, adipogenesis, and glucose metabolism. Concentrations of myeloperoxidase, epidermal growth factor receptor, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, coagulation factor Xa, contactin 4, kynureninase, neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1, and vesicular integral-membrane protein VIP36 were associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes in the Asian cohort. The diabetes odds ratio for a 2-fold higher protein abundance concentration ranged from 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.08) for neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 to 3.04 (95% CI: 2.13, 4.33) for kynureninase.

AC levels were measured by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) rates were measured by stable isotopic tracer techniques with indirect respiratory calorimetry. Results: During the insulin clamp at fasting, AC16:0 was significantly higher in the group with type 2 diabetes vs. FH- (p<0.05) In the postprandial state, AC2:0, AC16:0 and AC18:1 decreased significantly, but this reduction was blunted in type 2 diabetes, even during normalization of postprandial glucose levels during the insulin clamp. Fasting AC16:0 correlated with FAO(p=+0.604, p=0.0002), triacylglycerol (p=+0.427; p<0.02) and waist circumference (p=+0.416; p=0.02). Conclusions: Spillover of AC occurs in type 2 diabetes but is not fully established in FH+. AC16:0 can be a useful biomarker of excessive FAO.

Current biochemical biomarkers, such as serum creatinine and urinary albumin, have important limitations when used to identify the earliest indication of CKD or in tracking the progression to more advanced CKD. These issues underline the importance of finding and testing new molecular biomarkers that are capable of successfully meeting this clinical need. The measurement of changes in nature and/or levels of proteins and metabolites in biological samples from patients provide insights into pathophysiological processes. Proteomic and metabolomic techniques provide opportunities to record dynamic chemical signatures in patients over time. This review article presents an overview of the recent developments in the fields of metabolomics and proteomics in relation to CKD. Among the many different proteomic biomarkers proposed, there is particular interest in the CKD273 classifier, a urinary proteome biomarker reported to predict CKD progression and with implementation potential. Other individual non-invasive peptidomic biomarkers that are potentially relevant for CKD detection include type 1 collagen, uromodulin and mucin-1. Despite the limited sample sizes and variability of the metabolomics studies, some metabolites such as trimethylamine N-oxide, kynurenine and citrulline stand out as potential biomarkers in CKD.;;"Queens University Belfast; Belfast City Hospital; Belfast City Hospital";;;;;;;;;;40;44;;;;;;;;;;;FEB 20;2019;193;;;;;;93;122;;10.1016/j.jprot.2018.09.020;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2018.09.020;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000461002900008;View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods A total of 86 outpatients and 33 inpatients were recruited. Outpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were classified as T2DM without DR (n = 22), nonproliferative DR (NPDR) (n = 20) and proliferative DR (PDR) (n = 22) based on international clinical DR severity scales. A total of 86 plasma and 33 vitreous samples were collected and subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The diagnostic value of plasma LRG1 was tested using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results Plasma LRG1 in PDR patients (9025 +/- 1870 pg/ml) was significantly increased as compared with controls (5975 +/- 2022 pg/ml), T2DM without DR (6550 +/- 2359 pg/ml) and NPDR patients (6550 +/- 2359 pg/ml) (p < 0.0001). Vitreous LRG1 in PDR patients was elevated by approximately 4.3-fold than that in controls (562.1 +/- 273.5 ng/ml versus 130.0 +/- 102.8 ng/ml, p = 0.000). The area under the ROC curve value for plasma LRG1 was 0.786 (p < 0.0001). The maximal Youden index was 0.4372 and the optimal cut-off value of LRG1 was 7357.043 pg/ml with 81.82% sensitivity and 61.90% specificity.

This is caused by macro- and microvascular complications, as a consequence of the often late diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but especially by the difficulties to control glucose homeostasis due to the progressive nature of the disease. T2D is moreover a dual disease, with components of beta-cell failure and components of insulin resistance in peripheral organs, such as liver, fat, and muscle. Understanding the pathogenesis of the disease by gaining insight into the molecular pathways involved in both phenomena is one of the major assets of proteomic approaches. Moreover, proteomics and peptidomics may provide us with robust biomarkers for beta-cell failure, insulin resistance in pheripheral organs, but also for the development of diabetic complications.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) MGD shows a notable disturbance in lipid metabolism. Er-Dong-Xiao-Ke decoction (EDXKD) has important functions in nourishing yin, clearing heat, and removing blood stasis, which are effective in the treatment of DM MGD. Aim of the study: To observe the therapeutic effect of EDXKD on DM MGD and its underlying molecular mechanism. Materials and methods: After establishing a type 2 DM (T2DM)-induced MGD rat model, different doses of EDXKD and T0070907 were administered. The chemical constituents of EDXKD were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the molecular mechanism of EDXKD in treating DM MGD was predicted using network pharmacology. Lipid metabolism in DM meibomian glands (MGs) was analyzed using LC-MS/MS, and lipid biomarkers were screened and identified. Histological changes and lipid accumulation in MGs were detected by staining, and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) expression in MG acinar cells was detected by immunofluorescence. The expression of lipid metabolism-related factors was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) or western blotting. Results: EDXKD reduced lipid accumulation in the MGs and improved the ocular surface index in DM MGD rats. The main active components of EDXKD had advantages in lipid regulation. Additionally, the PPARG signaling pathway was the key pathway of EDXKD in the treatment of DM MGD. Twelve lipid metabolites were biomarkers of EDXKD in the treatment of DM MGD, and glycerophospholipid metabolism was the main pathway of lipid regulation. Moreover, EDXKD improved lipid deposition in the acini and upregulated the expression of PPARG. Further, EDXKD regulated the PPARG-mediated UCP2/AMPK signaling network, inhibited lipid production, and promoted lipid transport. Conclusion: EDXKD is an effective treatment for MGD in patients with T2DM. EDXKD can regulate lipids by regulating the PPARG-mediated UCP2/AMPK signaling network, as it reduced lipid accumulation in the MGs of DM MGD rats, promoted lipid metabolism, and improved MG function and ocular surface indices.;;"Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine; Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine; Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine";;;;;;;;;;3;3;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 28;2024;333;;;;;;;;118484;10.1016/j.jep.2024.118484;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2024.118484;;JUN 2024;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001263571600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Early diagnosis of the disease is quite inadequate. To screen urine biomarkers of DN and explore its potential mechanism, this study collected urine from 87 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (which will be classified into normal albuminuria, microalbuminuria, and macroalbuminuria groups) and 38 healthy subjects. Twelve individuals from each group were then randomly selected as the screening cohort for proteomics analysis and the rest as the validation cohort. The results showed that humoral immune response, complement activation, complement and coagulation cascades, renin-angiotensin system, and cell adhesion molecules were closely related to the progression of DN. Five overlapping proteins (KLK1, CSPG4, PLAU, SERPINA3, and ALB) were identified as potential biomarkers by machine learning methods. Among them, KLK1 and CSPG4 were positively correlated with the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), and SERPINA3 was negatively correlated with the UACR, which were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

The mechanisms underlying these improvements have so far not been elucidated fully. To further investigate the mechanisms of a VLCD with or without exercise and to uncover possible biomarkers associated with these interventions, blood samples were collected from 27 obese type 2 diabetes patients before and after a 16-week VLCD (Modifast,450 kcal/day). Thirteen of these patients followed an exercise program in addition to the VCLD. Plasma was obtained from 27 lean and 27 obese controls as well. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry (MS) and targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and a large scale isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) approach. After the 16-week VLCD, there was a significant decrease in body weight and HbA1c in all patients, without differences between the two intervention groups. Targeted MRM analysis revealed differences in several proteins, which could be divided in diabetes-associated (fibrinogen, transthyretin), obesity-associated (complement C3), and diet-associated markers (apolipoproteins, especially apolipoprotein A-IV). To further investigate the effects of exercise, large scale iTRAQ analysis was performed. However, no proteins were found showing an exercise effect. Thus, in this study, specific proteins were found to be differentially expressed in type 2 diabetes patients versus controls and before and after a VLCD. These proteins are potential disease state and intervention specific biomarkers.;;"Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Eindhoven University of Technology";;;;;;;;;;19;24;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 21;2014;9;11;;;;;;;e112835;10.1371/journal.pone.0112835;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0112835;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000346906600019;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, DKD patients couldn't be diagnosed early due to lack of special biomarkers. Urine is an ideal non-invasive sample for screening DKD biomarkers. This study aims to explore DKD special biomarkers by urinary proteomics. Materials and Methods: According to the result of renal biopsy, 142 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients were divided into 2 groups: DKD (n = 83) and NDRD (n = 59). Ten patients were selected from each group to define urinary protein profiles by label-free quantitative proteomics. The candidate proteins were further verifyied by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) methods (n = 40). Proteins which perform the same trend both in PRM and proteomics were verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) with expanding the sample size (n = 82). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic biomarkers. Results: We identified 417 peptides in urinary proteins showing significant difference between DKD and NDRD. PRM verification identified C7, SERPINA4, IGHG1, SEMG2, PGLS, GGT1, CDH2, CDH1 was consistent with the proteomic results and p < 0.05. Three potential biomarkers for DKD, C7, SERPINA4, and gGT1, were verified by ELISA.

Spine-related disorders are also significant health concerns for canine companions with etiopathogeneses, clinical presentations, and diagnostic and therapeutic options that are very similar to their human counterparts. Historically, induced and spontaneous pathology in laboratory rodents, dogs, sheep, goats, pigs, and nonhuman primates have been used for study of human spine disorders. While each of these can serve as useful preclinical models, they all have inherent limitations. Spontaneously occurring spine disorders in dogs provide highly translatable data that overcome many of the limitations of other models and have the added benefit of contributing to veterinary healthcare as well. For this scoping review, peer-reviewed manuscripts were selected from PubMed and Google Scholar searches using keywords: intervertebral disc, intervertebral disc degeneration, biomarkers, histopathology, canine, and mechanism. Additional keywords such as injury, induced model, and nucleus degeneration were used to further narrow inclusion. The objectives of this review were to (a) outline similarities in key features of spine disorders between dogs and humans; (b) describe relevant canine models; and (c) highlight the applicability of these models for advancing translational research and clinical application for mechanisms of disease, diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and treatment, with a focus on intervertebral disc degeneration. Best current evidence suggests that dogs share important anatomical, physiological, histological, and molecular components of spinal disorders in humans, such that induced and spontaneous canine models can be very effective for translational research. Taken together, the peer-reviewed literature supports numerous advantages for use of canine models for study of disorders of the spine when the potential limitations and challenges are addressed.";;"University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia";;;;;;;;;;19;23;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2020;3;4;;;SI;;;;e1109;10.1002/jsp2.1109;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsp2.1109;;JUL 2020;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000553639800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Contrary to the long-standing notion that the effects of the major risk factors on CVD outcomes are the same in both sexes, recent evidence recognizes new, potentially independent, sex/gender-related risk factors for CVDs, and sex/gender-differences in the clinical presentation of CVDs have been demonstrated. Furthermore, some therapeutic options may not be equally effective and safe in men and women. In this context, proteomics offers an extremely useful and versatile analytical platform for biomedical researches that expand from the screening of early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to the investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying CDVs. In this review, we summarized the current applications of proteomics in the cardiovascular field, with emphasis on sex and gender-related differences in CVDs. Significance: Increasing evidence supports the profound effect of sex and gender on cardiovascular physio-pathology and the response to drugs. A clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphisms in CVDs would not only improve our knowledge of the etiology of these diseases, but could also inform health policy makers and guideline committees in tailoring specific interventions for the prevention, treatment and management of CVDs in both men and women.;;"IRCCS Centro Cardiologico Monzino; Aston University";;;;;;;;;;11;12;;;;;;;;;;;APR 30;2018;178;;;;SI;;57;72;;10.1016/j.jprot.2018.03.017;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2018.03.017;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000432498000006;View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent advances in understanding its multiple etiologies and pathogenetic mechanisms provide more speculative hypotheses focused on even broader somatic systems. Using a targeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based metabolomic platform, we compared metabolic signatures consisting of monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitter (NT) metabolites in plasma/urine simultaneously between first-episode neuroleptic-naive schizophrenia patients (FENNS) and healthy controls before and after a 6-week risperidone monotherapy, which suggest that the patient NT profiles are restoring during treatment. To detect and identify potential biomarkers associated with schizophrenia and risperidone treatment, we also performed a combined ultraperformance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomic profiling of the same samples, indicating a further deviation of the patients' global metabolic profile from that of controls. The NTs and their metabolites together with the 32 identified biomarkers underpin that metabolic pathways including NT metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, antioxidant defense system, bowel microflora and endocrine system are disturbed in FENNS. Among them, pregnanediol, citrate and a-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) were significantly associated with symptomatology of schizophrenia after Bonferroni correction and may be useful biomarkers for monitoring therapeutic efficacy. These findings promise to yield valuable insights into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and may advance the approach to treatment, diagnosis and disease prevention of schizophrenia and related syndromes.;;"Central South University; Central South University; Central South University; Central South University";;;;;;;;;;91;100;;;;;;;;;;;AUG;2012;11;8;;;;;4338;4350;;10.1021/pr300459d;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr300459d;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000307037600038;View Full Record in Web of Science

Microalbuminuria has been used as a diagnostic marker of diabetic nephropathy. But owing to its insufficient sensitivity and specificity, other biomarkers are being sought. In addition, the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy is not fully understood and declines in renal function occur even without microalbuminuria. In this study, we investigated urinary proteins from three study groups (controls, and type 2 diabetic subjects with or without microalbuminuria). Non-targeted label-free Nano-LC QTOF analysis was conducted to discover underlying mechanisms and protein networks, and targeted label-free Nano-LC QTOF with SWATH was performed to qualify discovered protein candidates. Twenty-eight proteins were identified as candidates and functionally analyzed via String DB, gene ontology and pathway analysis. Four predictive mechanisms were analyzed: i) response to stimulus, ii) platelet activation, signaling and aggregation, iii) ECM-receptor interaction, and iv) angiogenesis. These mechanisms can provoke kidney dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients via endothelial cell damage and glomerulus structural alteration. Based on these analyses, three proteins (kininogen-1, basement membrane-specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan core protein, and roundabout homolog 4) were proposed for further study as potential biomarkers.

Generalized implementation of PN faces different obstacles, one of the most relevant being metabolic characterization of the individual. Although omics technologies allow for assessment the dynamics of metabolism with unprecedented detail, its translatability as affordable and simple PN protocols is still difficult due to the complexity of metabolic regulation and to different technical and economical constrains. In this work, we propose a conceptual framework that considers the dysregulation of a few overarching processes, namely Carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress and microbiota-derived metabolites, as the basis of the onset of several non-communicable diseases. These processes can be assessed and characterized by specific sets of proteomic, metabolomic and genetic markers that minimize operational constrains and maximize the information obtained at the individual level. Current machine learning and data analysis methodologies allow the development of algorithms to integrate omics and genetic markers. Reduction of dimensionality of variables facilitates the implementation of omics and genetic information in digital tools.

Experimental design: Peptide profiling was performed in urine samples before and after treatment using high-resolution capillary electrophoresis coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Results: A panel of 88 fenofibrate-sensitive peptides was detected with a frequency of >= 50% before and after treatment. This was reduced to 36 peptides by repeating the comparison ten times by randomly excluding samples at each time-point. Nineteen peptides were consistent and reliable biomarkers after an additional comparison with an age and sex-matched subject control group. Levels of peptides identified as fragments of Collagen alpha-1 (I), Collagen alpha-1 (XVII), Collagen alpha-2 (VIII) or sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit gamma were reduced after fenofibrate treatment. Classification scores for renal tubular and glomerular damages determined by support vector machine based biomarker models increased after treatment but remained below pathological score cutoff values. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Fenofibrate treatment led to minor modifications of the urinary proteomic profile in a way that does not create safety issues affecting glomerular and tubular functions.

Therefore, we explored whether there was an association between plasma leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) concentrations (i.e., a novel proinflammatory signaling molecule) and specific plasma ceramides in postmenopausal women with T2DM. Methods: We measured six previously identified plasma ceramides, which have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk [plasma Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer(d18:1/20:0), Cer(d18:1/22:0), Cer(d18:1/24:0) and Cer(d18:1/24:1)], amongst 99 Caucasian postmenopausal women with non-insulin-treated T2DM (mean age 72 +/- 8 years, mean hemoglobin A1c 6.9 +/- 0.7%), who consecutively attended our diabetes outpatient service during a 3-month period. Plasma ceramide and LRG1 concentrations were measured with a targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay and a Milliplex (R) MAP human cardiovascular disease magnetic bead kit, respectively. Results: In linear regression analyses, higher plasma LRG1 levels (1st tertile vs. 2nd and 3rd tertiles combined) were associated with higher levels of plasma Cer(d18:1/16:0) (standardized beta coefficient: 0.289, p = 0.004), Cer(d18:1/18:0) (standardized beta coefficient: 0.307, p = 0.002), Cer(d18:1/20:0) (standardized beta coefficient: 0.261, p = 0.009) or Cer(d18:1/24:1) (standardized beta coefficient: 0.343, p < 0.001). These associations remained significant even after adjusting for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol level, hemoglobin A1c, insulin resistance and statin use. Conclusions: The results of our pilot exploratory study suggest that higher plasma LRG1 concentration was associated with higher levels of specific high-risk plasma ceramide molecules in elderly postmenopausal women with metabolically well-controlled T2DM, even after adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors and other potential confounding variables.;;"University of Verona; Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata Verona; IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria; IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria; University of Verona; Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata Verona";;;;;;;;;;2;2;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2022;12;7;;;;;;;943;10.3390/biom12070943;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biom12070943;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000832235400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of its significant microvascular complications, associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this article is to review the literature regarding the latest advances in the management of type 2 DM (T2DM) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We initially refer to the screening guidelines, the diagnostic tests used, the need for novel biomarkers in DN, the recent advances in high-risk patient identification, the recommended glycemic targets, and concerns regarding the accuracy of HbA1c in these patients. Then, a detailed explanation of the appropriate medical management based on evidence from recent trials is presented, analyzed, and discussed. All patients with T2DM should be screened for albuminuria at initial diagnosis and annually thereafter. Proteomics and metabolomics today represent promising diagnostic tools. Optimal glycemic control, with individualized HbA1c targets, is fundamental for reduced onset or delayed progression of DN and microvascular complications, in general. This can be enhanced by lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions when needed. Metformin represents the first pharmacological step, with, recently, a broadened indication for patients with impaired renal function. If HbA1c remains above the target in patients with established CKD, SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA are the preferred second-line agents, as introduced in all new guidelines. This change was the result of recent landmark trials that highlighted the superiority of the two aforementioned medication categories in terms of both renal and cardiovascular outcomes.;;"European University Cyprus; Athens Medical School; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens";;;;;;;;;;9;9;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2020;19;4;;;;;467;476;;10.1007/s42000-020-00212-y;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42000-020-00212-y;;JUN 2020;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000537970000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to identify potential oxidative biomarkers in the blood plasma of patients with T2DM, we used LC-MS/MS-based proteomics to profile plasma samples from patients with T2DM and healthy controls. The results showed that human serum albumin (HSA) is damaged by irreversible cysteine trioxidation, which can be a potential oxidative stress biomarker for the early diagnosis of T2DM. The quantitative detection of site-specific thiol trioxidation is technically challenging; thus, we developed a sensitive and selective LC-MS/MS workflow that has been used to discover and quantify three unique thiol-trioxidized HSA peptides, ALVLIAFAQYLQQC((SO3H))PFEDHVK (m/z 1241.13), YIC((SO3H))ENQDSISSK (m/z 717.80) and RPC((SO3H))FSALEVDETYVPK (m/z 951.45), in 16 individual samples of healthy controls (n=8) and individuals with diabetes (n=8).

In addition, label-free quantitative proteomics was used to screen the key proteins for Pinctada martensii hydrolysate (PMH) to improve T2DM, and Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to verify the expression difference of differential proteins at protein and mRNA levels between different groups.Results: PMH were prepared and characterized. In vivo investigations revealed that the PMH could regulate blood glucose and improve glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance, reduced serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in db/db mice. Western blot results showed that PMH could up-regulate IRS-1, P-PI3K/PI3K and P-Akt/Akt levels in db/db mice. Label-free quantitative proteomic approach was used to analyze the proteome in db/db mouse liver, 231 proteins were reversed significantly (p < 0.05), and these proteins were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and other pathways. Further screened 15 proteins with FC > 1.2 could be enriched in the retinol metabolic pathway, and the proteins in this pathway were also verified.Conclusions: PMH has hypoglycemic effect and can be used as a potential natural T2DM intervener. The hypoglycemic activity of PMH is related to its regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The PI3K/AKT pathway and the retinol pathway are considered as another potential pathway for PMH to exert hypoglycemic effects.;;"Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine; Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine; Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine; Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine; Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine; Queens University Belfast";;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;JAN 30;2024;319;;1;;;;;;117104;10.1016/j.jep.2023.117104;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2023.117104;;SEP 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001076138000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cellular response to insulin. Recently, ER stress has been known to reduce the insulin sensitivity of the liver and lead to type 2 diabetes. However, detailed mechanisms of ER stress response that leads to type 2 diabetes remains unknown. To obtain a global view of ER function in type 2 diabetic liver and identify proteins that may be responsible for hepatic ER stress and insulin resistance, we performed proteomics analysis of mouse liver ER using nano UPLC-MSE. A total of 1584 proteins were identified in control C57 and type 2 diabetic db/db mice livers. Comparison of the rER and sER proteomes from normal mice showed that proteins involved in protein synthesis and metabolic process were enriched in the rER, while those associated with transport and cellular homeostasis were localized to the sER. In addition, proteins involved in protein folding and ER stress were found only in the rER. In the livers of db/db mice, however, the functions of the rER and sER were severely disrupted, including the capacity to resolve ER stress. These results provide new insight into the research on hepatic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and are suggestive of the potential use of the differentially expressed hepatic ER proteins as biomarkers for hepatic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.;;"Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI); Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI); Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI)";;;;;;;;;;7;7;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2012;13;12;;;;;17230;17243;;10.3390/ijms131217230;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms131217230;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000312608100103;View Full Record in Web of Science

While most efforts are centered on using blood samples for biomarker discovery, the use of saliva remains underexplored.MethodsUsing noninvasive saliva samples from 2974 Qatari subjects, we analyzed the microbial communities from diabetic, pre-diabetic, and non-diabetic participants based on their HbA1C levels. The salivary microbiota was assessed in all subjects by sequencing the V1-V3 regions of 16S rRNA gene. For the proteomics profiling, we randomly selected 50 gender and age-matched non-diabetic and diabetic subjects and compared their proteome with SOMAscan. Microbiota and proteome profiles were then integrated to reveal candidate biomarkers for T2D.ResultsOur results indicate that the salivary microbiota of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals differs significantly from that of non-diabetic subjects. Specifically, a significant increase in the abundance of Campylobacter, Dorea, and Bacteroidales was observed in the diabetic subjects compared to their non-diabetic controls. Metabolic pathway prediction analysis for these bacteria revealed a significant overrepresentation of genes associated with fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis, as well as aromatic amino acid metabolism in the diabetic group. Additionally, we observed distinct differences in salivary proteomic profiles between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Notably, levels of Haptoglobin, Plexin-C1, and MCL-1 were elevated, while Osteopontin (SPP1), Histone1H3A (HIST3H2A), and Histone H1.2 were reduced in diabetic individuals. Furthermore, integrated correlation analysis of salivary proteome and microbiota data demonstrated a strong positive correlation between HIST1H3A and HIST3H2A with Porphyromonas sp., all of which were decreased in the diabetic group.ConclusionThis is the first study to assess the salivary microbiota in T2D patients from a large cohort of the Qatari population. We found significant differences in the salivary microbiota of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals compared to non-diabetic controls. Our study is also the first to assess the salivary proteome using SOMAScan in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects.

The etiology of MetS is determined by the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Effective prevention and treatment of MetS notably decreases the risk of its complications such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. According to recent genome-wide association studies, multiple genes are involved in the incidence and development of MetS. The presence of particular genes which are responsible for obesity and lipid metabolism, affecting insulin sensitivity and blood pressure, as well as genes associated with inflammation, can increase the risk of MetS. These molecular markers, together with clinical data and findings from proteomic, metabolomic, pharmacokinetic, and other methods, would clarify the etiology and pathophysiology of MetS and facilitate the development of personalized approaches to the management of MetS. The application of personalized medicinebased on susceptibility identified genomes would help physicians recommend healthier lifestyles and prescribe medications to improve various aspects of health in patients with MetS. In recent years, personalized medicine by genetic testing has helped physicians determine genetic predisposition to MetS, prevent the disease by behavioral, lifestyle-related, or therapeutic interventions, and detect, diagnose, treat, and manage the disease. Clinically, personalized medicine is providing effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of MetS by reducing the time, cost, and failure rate of pharmaceutical clinical trials. It is also eliminating trial-and-error inefficiencies that inflate health care costs and undermine patient care.;;"Isfahan University of Medical Sciences; Isfahan University of Medical Sciences; Isfahan University of Medical Sciences; Central Michigan University";;;;;;;;;;8;8;;;;;;;;;;;JUL 15;2022;18;;;;;;;;2475;10.22122/arya.v18i0.2475;http://dx.doi.org/10.22122/arya.v18i0.2475;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000885972400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study was focused on: (i) testing of the HR MS and MS/MS feasibility and performances in mapping and sequencing of renal gangliosides in Type 2 DM patients; (ii) determination of the changes in the urine gangliosidome of DKD patients in different stages of the disease-normo-, micro-, and macroalbuminuria-in a comparative assay with healthy controls. Due to the high resolution and mass accuracy, the comparative MS screening revealed that the sialylation status of the ganglioside components; their modification by O-acetyl, CH3COO-, O-fucosyl, and O-GalNAc; as well as the composition of the ceramide represent possible markers for early DKD detection, the assessment of disease progression, and follow-up treatment.

To better understand the recovery process of those diabetic rodents, we examined the effect of hypoglycemic dipeptide Cyclo (His-Pro) (CHP) treatment on the differential expression of pancreatic proteins in both animal models. Oral administration of CHP had an excellent hypoglycemic effect in both animal models, lowering the average plasma glucose level by over 50%. Pancreatic proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. This study allowed, for the first time, the identification of 34 proteins that are related to diabetes and potential targets of CHP, a potent anti-diabetic agent for both T1DM and T2DM. The alterations in the expression of these proteins could indicate a tendency for diabetic animals to overcome their diabetic state. These proteins are involved in cellular functions such as metabolism, cellular structure, oxidative stress, as well as signal and energy transduction. Some have already been linked to diabetes, suggesting that the newly identified proteins might also be significant in the etiology of this pathology and should be further investigated. Furthermore, CHP has emerged as a potent tool for both the treatment and study of the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetes. Thus, the findings presented here provide new insights into the study and potential treatment of this pathology. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

In this study, metabolic profiling of blood samples collected from GDM, T2DM and control pregnant women was undertaken to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers in GDM/T2DM and compared to pregnancy outcome. Methods Sixty-seven pregnant women (21 controls, 32 GDM, 14 T2DM) in their second trimester underwent targeted metabolomics of plasma samples using tandem mass spectrometry with the Biocrates MxP(R)Quant 500 Kit. Linear regression models were used to identify the metabolic signature of GDM and T2DM, followed by generalized linear model (GLMNET) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine best predictors of GDM, T2DM and pre-term labor. Results The gestational age at delivery was 2 weeks earlier in T2DM compared to GDM and controls and correlated negatively with maternal HbA1C and systolic blood pressure and positively with serum albumin. Linear regression models revealed elevated glutamate and branched chain amino acids in GDM + T2DM group compared to controls. Regression models also revealed association of lower levels of triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols containing oleic and linoleic fatty acids with pre-term delivery. A generalized linear model ROC analyses revealed that that glutamate is the best predictors of GDM compared to controls (area under curve; AUC = 0.81). The model also revealed that phosphatidylcholine diacyl C40:2, arachidonic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, and phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C34:3 are the best predictors of GDM + T2DM compared to controls (AUC = 0.90). The model also revealed that the triacylglycerols C17:2/36:4 and C18:1/34:1 are the best predictors of pre-term delivery (<= 37 weeks) (AUC = 0.84).

The predictive and therapeutic value of HMGB1 as a biomarker has been confirmed in various diseases. However, its value in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the correlation between serum and urine HMGB1 levels and DKD progression. Methods: We recruited 196 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including 109 with DKD and 87 T2DM patients without DKD. Additionally, 60 healthy participants without T2DM were also recruited as controls. Serum and urine samples were collected for HMGB1 analysis. Simultaneously, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFR-1) in serum and kidney injury molecule (KIM-1) in urine samples were evaluated for comparison. Results: Serum and urine HMGB1 levels were significantly higher in patients with DKD than in patients with T2DM and healthy controls. Additionally, serum HMGB1 levels significantly and positively correlated with serum TNFR-1 (R-2 = 0.567, p<0.001) and urine KIM-1 levels (R-2 = 0.440, p<0.001), and urine HMGB1 has a similar correlation. In the population with T2DM, the risk of DKD progression increased with an increase in serum HMGB1 levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that elevated serum HMGB1 level was an independent risk factor for renal function progression in patients with DKD, and regression analysis did not change in the model corrected for multiple variables. The restricted cubic spline depicted a nonlinear relationship between serum HMGB1 and renal function progression in patients with DKD (p-nonlinear=0.007, p<0.001), and this positive effect remained consistent across subgroups. Conclusion: Serum HMGB1 was significantly correlated with DKD and disease severity. When the HMGB1 level was >= 27 ng/ml, the risk of renal progression increased sharply, indicating that serum HMGB1 can be used as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of DKD progression.;;"Guang'anmen Hospital, CACMS; China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences; China-Japan Friendship Hospital; Beijing University of Chinese Medicine";;;;;;;;;;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;FEB 28;2024;15;;;;;;;;1334109;10.3389/fimmu.2024.1334109;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1334109;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001182282100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Malfunction of 1 organ may cause dysfunction of the other with variable causative disease that defines the type of CRS (1-5). Numerous studies showed that the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is increased in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Similarly, CKD affects a large proportion of patients with heart failure. This overlap between primary heart or primary kidney disease blurs cause-effect inferences of the initiator/target organ. The classical subdivision of CRS in 5 categories does not provide pathophysiological suggestions for targeted intervention. It seems timely to revisit the value of CRS biomarkers in a pathophysiology-centered approach. We systematically reviewed the literature in CRS, which revealed 53 clinical studies describing the use of 44 biomarkers and 4 proteomic panels. All biomarkers are involved in at least one of the CRS comorbidities. Among the pathways affected, inflammation, aberrant glucose metabolism, neurohormonal activation, and oxidative stress are well described. There is growing evidence that fibrosis may be the cornerstone that unifies most of the pathways leading to CRS. Formation of excess fibrous connective tissue antedates CRS in many cases. This review highlights that biomarkers reflecting fibrosis may be of substantial clinical value in the early detection, prognostication, and guiding treatment of CRS. Biomarkers detecting changes in collagen turnover in the extracellular matrix of heart and kidney appear able to depict subclinical changes in the fibrotic remodeling of tissues and constitute a promising approach toward personalized intervention in CRS.;;"Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) Solutions; RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University Hospital; KU Leuven; Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg";;;;;;;;;;12;12;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2021;34;7;;;;;669;679;;10.1093/ajh/hpaa201;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajh/hpaa201;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000692321300002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Proteomic technology may provide a useful approach to identify novel protein patterns potentially related to pathophysiological changes that lead up to diabetes. In this study, we sought to identify protein signals that are associated with diabetes incidence in a middle-aged population. Serum samples from 519 participants in a nested case-control selection (167 cases and 352 age-, sex- and BMI-matched normoglycemic control subjects, median follow-up 14.0 years) within the Whitehall-II cohort were analyzed by linear matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Nine protein peaks were found to be associated with incident diabetes. Rate ratios for high peak intensity ranged between 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.8) and 4.0 (95% CI, 1.7-9.2) and were robust to adjustment for main potential confounders, including obesity, lipids and C-reactive protein. The proteins associated with these peaks may reflect diabetes pathogenesis.

Hyperglycemia triggers apoptosis and kidney damage. Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) and TAM receptor tyrosine kinases, Tyro3, Axl, and Mer, are phagocytic receptors that mediate the clearance of apoptotic cells. This study aimed to identify the role of MFG-E8 and TAM receptors in the development of DN.Methods:A total of 146 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), early stage DN, clinical DN and 48 healthy controls were employed to analyze the serum levels of MFG-E8, soluble Tyro3, Axl, Mer, and RAGE by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The serum levels of CREA, hsCRP, CysC, and beta 2-microglobulin were measured by spectrophotometric analysis using a biochemical analyzer (AU5800).Results:Our results showed that the serum levels of MFG-E8 were elevated in patients with T2DM compared with healthy controls; however, it decreased gradually in patients with DN with the severity of kidney injury, especially in the clinical DN group. Moreover, the levels of sTyro3, sAxl, and sMer were reduced in patients with T2DM and DN compared to healthy controls, particularly in patients with DN. The levels of MFG-E8, sTyro3, sAxl, and sMer were negatively correlated with UAER at 24 hours, CREA, hsCRP, CysC, beta 2-microglobulin, and RAGE, respectively. In addition, TAM receptors had significantly higher predictive and diagnostic values for early stage DN from T2DM than hsCRP, beta 2-microglobulin, and CysC, which are also predictive biomarkers of early stage DN from clinical DN.Conclusions:Decreased MFG-E8 and TAM receptor expression is associated with an increased risk of microvascular complications in patients with T2DM, which plays a critical role in the diagnosis of diabetic patients with microvascular complications, especially early stage DN, and in monitoring the development of DN.";;Wuhan University of Science & Technology;;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 3;2023;102;44;;;;;;;e35788;10.1097/MD.0000000000035788;http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000035788;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001105877600085;View Full Record in Web of Science

As demonstrated by electrochemical measurements, the tips show the highest binding efficiency for glucose at pH 8.2 employing ammonium chloride/ammonia buffer with ionic strength of 150 mM, exceeding taurine buffer at the same concentration. The bound constituents were released by sorbitol and formic acid. It was also demonstrated that elution with sorbitol at 1.2 M is superior to acidic media. Comparison of results was based on the numbers of detected peptides and their glycated sites. Using sorbitol for elution requires desalting prior to analysis. Therefore, three different sorbents were tested: fullerene-derivatized silica. ZipTip (C18), and C18 silica. Fullerene-derivatized silica and ZipTip showed the same performance regarding the numbers of glycated pepticles, and sites were better than C18 silica. The elaborated off-line method was compared with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) measurements, by which considerable less modified pepticles were detected. Affinity tips used under optimized conditions were tested for the analysis of human serum albumin (HSA) from sera of healthy and diabetic individuals. A peptide with a mass of 1783.9 Da could be detected only in samples of diabetic patients and, therefore, could be a very interesting biomarker candidate. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Given the high risk of progressive renal function loss and end-stage renal disease, early identification of patients with a renal risk is important. Novel biomarkers may aid in improving renal risk stratification. In this review, we first focus on the classical panel of albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate as the primary clinical predictors of renal disease and then move our attention to novel biomarkers, primarily concentrating on assay-based multiple/panel biomarkers, proteomics biomarkers and metabolomics biomarkers. We focus on multiple biomarker panels since the molecular processes of renal disease progression in type 2 diabetes are heterogeneous, rendering it unlikely that a single biomarker significantly adds to clinical risk prediction. A limited number of prospective studies of multiple biomarkers address the predictive performance of novel biomarker panels in addition to the classical panel in type 2 diabetes. However, the prospective studies conducted so far have small sample sizes, are insufficiently powered and lack external validation. Adequately sized validation studies of multiple biomarker panels are thus required. There is also a paucity of studies that assess the effect of treatments on novel biomarker panels and determine whether initial treatment-induced changes in novel biomarkers predict changes in long-term renal outcomes. Such studies can not only improve our healthcare but also our understanding of the mechanisms of actions of existing and novel drugs and may yield biomarkers that can be used to monitor drug response. We conclude that this will be an area to focus research on in the future.;;"University of Groningen; University of Glasgow; Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH (MOS); RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University Hospital; Medical University of Vienna; Medical University of Vienna; Medical University of Vienna; Emergentec Biodevelopment GmbH; Medical University of Innsbruck; Steno Diabetes Center; Aarhus University; University of Copenhagen";;;;;;;;;;35;36;;;;;;;;;;;AUG;2015;30;;;4;;;86;95;;10.1093/ndt/gfv252;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfv252;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000359781800011;View Full Record in Web of Science

Some patients with the comorbidities of diabetes and other primary renal diseases have similar clinical features to DN, which is defined as non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD). It is necessary to distinguish between DN and NDRD, considering they differ in their pathological characteristics, treatment regimes, and prognosis. Renal biopsy provides a gold standard; however, it is difficult for this to be conducted in all patients. Therefore, it is necessary to discover non-invasive biomarkers that can distinguish between DN and NDRD. In this research, the urinary exosomes were isolated from the midstream morning urine based on ultracentrifugation combined with 0.22 mu m membrane filtration. Data-independent acquisition-based quantitative proteomics were used to define the proteome profile of urinary exosomes from DN (n = 12) and NDRD (n = 15) patients diagnosed with renal biopsy and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients without renal damage (n = 9), as well as healthy people (n = 12). In each sample, 3372 +/- 722.1 proteins were identified on average. We isolated 371 urinary exosome proteins that were significantly and differentially expressed between DN and NDRD patients, and bioinformatic analysis revealed them to be mainly enriched in the immune and metabolic pathways. The use of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression further identified phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase domain containing 1 (PHYHD1) as the differential diagnostic biomarker, the efficacy of which was verified with another cohort including eight DN patients, five NDRD patients, seven T2DM patients, and nine healthy people. Additionally, a concentration above 1.203 mu g/L was established for DN based on the ELISA method. Furthermore, of the 19 significantly different expressed urinary exosome proteins selected by using the protein-protein interaction network and LASSO logistic regression, 13 of them were significantly related to clinical indicators that could reflect the level of renal function and hyperglycemic management.";;"Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Biophysics, CAS";;;;;;;;;;4;5;;;;;;;;;;;SEP;2023;24;17;;;;;;;13560;10.3390/ijms241713560;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms241713560;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001144834200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Contrary to the long-standing notion that the effects of the major risk factors on CVD outcomes are the same in both sexes, recent evidence recognizes new, potentially independent, sex/gender-related risk factors for CVDs, and sex/gender-differences in the clinical presentation of CVDs have been demonstrated. Furthermore, some therapeutic options may not be equally effective and safe in men and women. In this context, proteomics offers an extremely useful and versatile analytical platform for biomedical researches that expand from the screening of early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to the investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying CDVs. In this review, we summarized the current applications of proteomics in the cardiovascular field, with emphasis on sex and gender-related differences in CVDs. Significance: Increasing evidence supports the profound effect of sex and gender on cardiovascular physio-pathology and the response to drugs. A clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphisms in CVDs would not only improve our knowledge of the etiology of these diseases, but could also inform health policy makers and guideline committees in tailoring specific interventions for the prevention, treatment and management of CVDs in both men and women.;;"IRCCS Centro Cardiologico Monzino; Aston University";;;;;;;;;;19;22;;;;;;;;;;;FEB 20;2018;173;;;;;;62;76;;10.1016/j.jprot.2017.11.012;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2017.11.012;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000425204300007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is currently the most dominant chronic liver disease in Western countries due to the fact that hepatic steatosis is associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome and drug-induced injury. A variety of chemicals, mainly drugs, and diets is known to cause hepatic steatosis in humans and rodents. Experimental non-alcoholic fatty liver disease models rely on the application of a diet or the administration of drugs to laboratory animals or the exposure of hepatic cell lines to these drugs. More recently, genetically modified rodents or zebrafish have been introduced as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease models. Considerable interest now lies in the discovery and development of novel non-invasive biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, with specific focus on hepatic steatosis. Experimental diagnostic biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, such as (epi)genetic parameters and '-omics'-based read-outs are still in their infancy, but show great promise. In this paper, the array of tools and models for the study of liver steatosis is discussed. Furthermore, the current state-of-art regarding experimental biomarkers such as epigenetic, genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabonomic biomarkers will be reviewed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We identified and compared metabolite signatures in obese children with type 2 diabetes (T2D), obese children without diabetes (OB), and healthy, age- and gender-matched normal weight controls (NW) by measuring 273 analytes in fasting plasma and 24-hour urine samples from 90 subjects by targeted LC-MS/MS. Diabetic subjects were within 2 years of diagnosis in an attempt to capture early-stage disease prior to declining renal function. We found 22 urine metabolites that were uniquely associated with T2D when compared to OB and NW groups. The metabolites most significantly elevated in T2D youth included members of the betaine pathway, nucleic acid metabolism, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and their catabolites. Notably, the metabolite pattern in OB and T2D groups differed between urine and plasma, suggesting that urinary BCAAs and their intermediates behaved as a more specific biomarker for T2D, while plasma BCAAs associated with the obese, insulin resistant state independent of diabetes status. Correlative analysis of metabolites in the T2D signature indicated that betaine metabolites, BCAAs, and aromatic amino acids were associated with hyperglycemia, but BCAA acylglycine derivatives and nucleic acid metabolites were linked to insulin resistance. Of major interest, we found that urine levels of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICA-riboside) were increased in diabetic youth, identifying urine SAICA-riboside as a potential biomarker for T2D.;;"University of California System; University of California San Diego; Rady Childrens Hospital San Diego; Keio University; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio";;;;;;;;;;24;26;;;;;;;;;;;JUN 26;2020;15;6;;;;;;;e0234970;10.1371/journal.pone.0234970;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234970;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000545759800038;View Full Record in Web of Science

The Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD273) peptide classifier has been found to predict development of DKD even before microalbuminuria develops. Seventy four percent of peptides in the CKD273 classifier are Collagen degradation fragments. The Beta-CrossLaps (beta-CTx) Enzyme Llinked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) assay detects the specific collagen degradation product, C terminal telopeptide of Type 1 collagen. In light of the Capillary Electrophoresis/Mass Spectrometry (CE-MS) findings, linking collagen degradation fragments excretion to early detection of DKD, the significance of urinary beta-CTx levels as a DKD biomarker needs to be evaluated. Aim: To study the urinary excretion of beta-CTx in type 2 diabetes patients and to evaluate its relation to Microalbuminuria status and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of the patients. Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was undertaken at a tertiary care hospital, with enrollment of 82 type 2 diabetes patients from the diabetes Out Patient Department (OPD) Participants were divided into groups based on their Urinary Albumin Creatinine Ratio (UACR) and eGFR levels. The study participants were tested for Urinary beta-CTx level, UACR and eGFR. Mean or median was calculated for the parameters with normal and non-normal distribution, respectively. All statistical testing was performed on online calculators available at the site; https://www.socscistatistics.com/. Results: The median urinary beta-CTx level observed was 100.6 ng/mmol of creatinine. Among the 82 participants, 15 participants had urinary beta-CTx level 15pg/mL, the sensitivity of the kit. Among the remaining 67 participants, the minimum Urinary Beta-CrossLaps: Creatinine ratio observed was 2.6 ng/mmol and the maximum value observed was 2071 ng/mmol (i.e., 2.1 mu g/mmol). The median urinary beta-CTx level was highest (100.6 ng/mmol creatinine) in the patient group with eGFR in the normal range. The urinary beta-CTx level was found to decline with decline in eGFR, with median urinary beta-CTx 65.5 ng/mmol creatinine in the patient group with mildly decreased eGFR and 7.2 ng/mmol creatinine in the patient group with moderately decreased eGFR. Conclusion: The Urinary beta-CTx concentration in type 2 diabetes patients is dispersed over a wide range. The Urinary beta-CTx concentration correlates with the eGFR of the patient and is not influenced by age, gender or duration of diabetes. This parameter is a potential early DKD biomarker.";;;;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2021;15;7;;;;;;;BC05-BC08;10.7860/JCDR/2021/48085.15100;http://dx.doi.org/10.7860/JCDR/2021/48085.15100;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000681215700004;View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent Findings Technological and analytical advancements have enabled identification of novel protein biomarkers and signatures that help to address challenges of existing approaches to predict and screen for T2D. Genetic studies have so far revealed putative causal roles for only few of the proteins that have been linked to T2D, but ongoing large-scale genetic studies of the plasma proteome will help to address this and increase our understanding of aetiological pathways and mechanisms leading to diabetes. Studies of the human plasma proteome have started to elucidate its potential for T2D prediction and biomarker discovery.

In addition, we assessed sex-specific associations between the validated proteins and pathophysiological pathways of type 2 diabetes. Methods This cross-sectional study included Black South African men (n=380) and women (n=375) who were part of the Middle- Aged Soweto Cohort (MASC). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to determine fat mass and visceral adipose tissue, and fasting venous blood samples were collected for analysis of glucose, insulin and C-peptide and for targeted proteomics, measuring a total of 184 pre-selected protein biomarkers. An OGTT was performed on participants without diabetes, and peripheral insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), HOMA-IR, basal insulin clearance, insulin secretion (C-peptide index) and beta cell function (disposition index) were estimated. Participants were classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n=546), IGM (n=116) or type 2 diabetes (n= 93). Proteins associated with dysglycaemia (IGM or type 2 diabetes) in the MASC were validated in the Swedish EpiHealth cohort (NGT, n=1706; impaired fasting glucose, n=550; type 2 diabetes, n=210). Results We identified 73 proteins associated with dysglycaemia in the MASC, of which 34 were validated in the EpiHealth cohort. Among these validated proteins, 11 were associated with various measures of insulin dynamics, with the largest number of proteins being associated with HOMA-IR. In sex-specific analyses, IGF-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) was associated with lower HOMA-IR in women (coefficient -0.35; 95% CI -0.44, -0.25) and men (coefficient -0.09; 95% CI -0.15, -0.03). Metalloproteinase inhibitor 4 (TIMP4) was associated with higher insulin secretion (coefficient 0.05; 95% CI 0.001, 0.11; p for interaction=0.025) and beta cell function (coefficient 0.06; 95% CI 0.02, 0.09; p for interaction=0.013) in women only. In contrast, a stronger positive association between IGFBP2 and insulin sensitivity determined using an OGTT (coefficient 0.38; 95% CI 0.27, 0.49) was observed in men (p for interaction=0.004). A posteriori analysis showed that the associations between TIMP4 and insulin dynamics were not mediated by adiposity. In contrast, most of the associations between IGFBP2 and insulin dynamics, except for insulin secretion, were mediated by either fat mass index or visceral adipose tissue in men and women. Fat mass index was the strongest mediator between IGFBP2 and insulin sensitivity (total effect mediated 40.7%; 95% CI 37.0, 43.6) and IGFBP2 and HOMA-IR (total effect mediated 39.1%; 95% CI 31.1, 43.5) in men. Conclusions/interpretation We validated 34 proteins that were associated with type 2 diabetes, of which 11 were associated with measures of type 2 diabetes pathophysiology such as peripheral insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. This study highlights biomarkers that are similar between cohorts of different ancestry, with different lifestyles and sociodemographic profiles. The African-specific biomarkers identified require validation in African cohorts to identify risk markers and increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in African populations.";;"University of Witwatersrand; South African Medical Research Council; University of Cape Town; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; South African Medical Research Council; National Health Laboratory Service; National Health Laboratory Service; University of Witwatersrand; University of Southampton; Umea University; Lund University; Lund University; Skane University Hospital; Uppsala University; Uppsala University; Uppsala University Hospital";;;;;;;;;;2;2;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2023;66;1;;;;;174;189;;10.1007/s00125-022-05788-1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-022-05788-1;;SEP 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000854821000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: Two-dimensional image-converted analysis of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry detected the proteins differentially excreted between normoalbuminuric and macroalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n = 6 each). Urinary levels of excreted proteins were measured by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis using an independent sample set (n = 77). Urinary afamin levels were measured by ELISA in T2DM and DN patients enrolled in this cohort study (n = 203). Results: One-hundred-four proteins displayed significant alterations in excretion. Nine of these candidates were validated by MRM analysis. Among them, the levels of afamin, CD44 antigen, and lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2, which have not previously been implicated in DN, were significantly associated with both the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) and eGFR. We further measured afamin levels in urine collected from T2DM patients who did not yet have significant kidney disease (ACR < 300 mg/g or eGFR change rate <= 3.3%/year). The urinary afamin to creatinine ratio (Afa/Cre) was significantly higher in patients who progressed to a more severe DN stage or had early renal decline than in patients who did not. Conclusions: Afa/Cre was significantly increased in T2DM patients who subsequently developed DN. Afa/Cre may be useful to predict patients with T2DM at high risk of nephropathy before the development of macroalbuminuria or reduced kidney function, although further validation studies in a larger population are needed.

In particular, cell omics technologies may provide innovative biomarkers for the identification of rare specific progenitor cell subpopulations, assess transcriptional and proteomic changes affecting cell proliferation and immunomodulatory potential, and accurately define the lineage hierarchy and differentiation status of progenitor cells. Unraveling adipose tissue complexity may also provide for the precise assessment of a dysfunctional state, which has been associated with cancer, as cancer-associated adipocytes play an important role in shaping the tumor microenvironment supporting tumor progression and metastasis, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The information collected by single-cell omics has relevant implications for regenerative medicine because adipose tissue is an accessible source of multipotent cells; alternative cell-free approaches, including the use of adipose tissue stromal cell-conditioned medium, extracellular vesicles, or decellularized extracellular matrix, are clinically valid options. Subcutaneous white adipose tissue, which is generally harvested via liposuction, is highly heterogeneous because of intrinsic biological variability and extrinsic inconsistencies in the harvesting and processing procedures. The current limited understanding of adipose tissue heterogeneity impinges on the definition of quality standards appropriate for clinical translation, which requires consistency and uniformity of the administered product.

Laboratory studies on the basic biology of ageing have shed light on numerous genetic pathways that have strong effects on lifespan. However, we still do not know the degree to which the pathways that affect ageing in the lab also influence variation in rates of ageing and age-related disease in human populations. Similarly, despite considerable effort, we have yet to identify reliable and reproducible 'biomarkers', which are predictors of one's biological as opposed to chronological age. One challenge lies in the enormous mechanistic distance between genotype and downstream ageing phenotypes. Here, we consider the power of studying 'endophenotypes' in the context of ageing. Endophenotypes are the various molecular domains that exist at intermediate levels of organization between the genotype and phenotype. We focus our attention specifically on proteins and metabolites. Proteomic and metabolomic profiling has the potential to help identify the underlying causal mechanisms that link genotype to phenotype. We present a brief review of proteomics and metabolomics in ageing research with a focus on the potential of a systems biology and network-centric perspective in geroscience. While network analyses to study ageing utilizing proteomics and metabolomics are in their infancy, they may be the powerful model needed to discover underlying biological processes that influence natural variation in ageing, age-related disease, and longevity.;;"University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle";;;;;;;;;;61;68;;;;;;;;;;;;2017;61;3;;;;;379;388;;10.1042/EBC20160083;http://dx.doi.org/10.1042/EBC20160083;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000450752900007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Among 245 matched protein spots, 36 exhibited marked differences in normal patients with abdominal obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes compared to levels in normal patients without abdominal obesity. Seven (Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, Alpha-1-antitrypsin, Apolipoprotein A-I, haptoglobin, retinol-binding protein 4, transthyretin, and zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein) of these spots exhibited significant differences between normal and prediabetes/diabetes patients. After a network analysis, functional annotation using Gene Ontology indicated that most of the identified proteins were involved in lipid transport, lipid localization, and the regulation of serum lipo-protein particle levels. Our results indicated that variation in the levels of these identified protein biomarkers has been reported in normal, prediabetes and diabetic Assessment of the levels of these biomarkers may contribute to the development of biomarkers for not only early diagnosis but also in prognosis of diabetes mellitus type 2.;;"Catholic Kwandong University; Catholic Kwandong University; Daegu University; Keimyung University; Keimyung University; Keimyung University; Keimyung University; Keimyung University";;;;;;;;;;35;35;;;;;;;;;;;SEP 10;2019;14;9;;;;;;;e0222032;10.1371/journal.pone.0222032;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222032;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000532172700016;View Full Record in Web of Science

Selection of the most promising candidates between the initial untargeted step and the subsequent validation phases is critical within the pipeline leading to clinical tests. Several statistical and data mining methods have been described for feature selection: in particular, wrapper approaches iteratively assess the performance of the classifier on distinct subsets of variables. Current wrappers, however, do not estimate the significance of the selected features. We therefore developed a new methodology to find the smallest feature subset which significantly contributes to the model performance, by using a combination of resampling, ranking of variable importance, significance assessment by permutation of the feature values in the test subsets, and half-interval search. We wrapped our biosigner algorithm around three reference binary classifiers (Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines) which have been shown to achieve specific performances depending on the structure of the dataset. By using three real biological and clinical metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets (containing up to 7000 features), complementary signatures were obtained in a few minutes, generally providing higher prediction accuracies than the initial full model. Comparison with alternative feature selection approaches further indicated that our method provides signatures of restricted size and high stability. Finally, by using our methodology to seek metabolites discriminating type 1 from type 2 diabetic patients, several features were selected, including a fragment from the taurochenodeoxycholic bile acid. Our methodology, implemented in the biosigner R/Bioconductor package and Galaxy/Workflow4metabolomics module, should be of interest for both experimenters and statisticians to identify robust molecular signatures from large omics datasets in the process of developing new diagnostics.;;"CEA; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Universite Paris Saclay";;;;;;;;;;43;46;;;;;;;;;;;;2016;3;;;;;;;;26;10.3389/fmolb.2016.00026;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2016.00026;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000455328600026;View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper aims to search for, analyze, and synthesize current updates regarding the development of these efforts. Methods: We systematically searched the ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and PubMed databases for observational studies of protein biomarkers in patients with diabetes mellitus. We included studies published between January 2018 and April 2020, that were based on a population of patients with type-1 or type-2 diabetes mellitus aged > 18 years, with an observational design such as cross-sectional, case-control, or cohort studies. The dependent variable of the research results was in the form of protein biomarkers from urine, plasma, or serum. Results: Following the screening process, 20 research articles with available full text met the inclusion criteria. These could be categorized as glomerular biomarkers (ANGPTL4, beta-2 microglobulin, Smad1, and glypican-5); inflammatory biomarkers (MCP-1 and adiponectin); and tubular biomarkers (NGAL, VDBP, megalin, sKlotho, and KIM-1). The development of a panel of biomarkers showed more promising results than those for a single biomarker in diagnosing diabetic kidney disease. Conclusion: All the biomarkers discussed in this review showed promising results for predicting diabetic kidney disease because they correlate with albuminuria, eGFR, or both. However, of the 11 protein biomarkers, none have prognostic value beyond albuminuria and eGFR.";;University of Indonesia;;;;;;;;;;17;17;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2021;12;;;;;;;;2,04202E+16;10.1177/20420188211049612;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/20420188211049612;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000712076300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective We aimed to identify proteomic biomarkers associated with incident T2D and assess its joint effect with dietary or lifestyle factors on the T2D risk. Methods We established 2 nested case-control studies for incident T2D: discovery cohort (median 6.5 years of follow-up, 285 case-control pairs) and validation cohort (median 2.8 years of follow-up, 38 case-control pairs). We integrated untargeted mass spectrometry-based proteomics and interpretable machine learning to identify T2D-related proteomic biomarkers. We constructed a protein risk score (PRS) with the identified proteomic biomarkers and used a generalized estimating equation to evaluate PRS-T2D relationship with repeated profiled proteome. We evaluated association of PRS with trajectory of glycemic traits in another non-T2D cohort (n = 376). Multiplicative interactions of dietary or lifestyle factors with PRS were evaluated using logistic regression. Results Seven proteins (SHBG, CAND1, APOF, SELL, MIA3, CFH, IGHV1-2) were retained as the proteomic biomarkers for incident T2D. PRS (per SD change) was positively associated with incident T2D across 2 cohorts, with an odds ratio 1.29 (95% CI, 1.08-1.54) and 1.84 (1.19-2.84), respectively. Participants with a higher PRS had a higher probability showing unfavored glycemic trait trajectory in the non-T2D cohort. Red meat intake and PRS showed a multiplicative interaction on T2D risk in the discovery (P = 0.003) and validation cohort (P = 0.017). Conclusion This study identified proteomic biomarkers for incident T2D among the Chinese populations. The higher intake of red meat may synergistically interact with the proteomic biomarkers to exaggerate the T2D risk.;;"Westlake University; Westlake Laboratory; Westlake University; Westlake University; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Ningbo University";;;;;;;;;;6;6;;;;;;;;;;;MAY 17;2022;107;6;;;;;1616;1625;;10.1210/clinem/dgac098;http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgac098;;FEB 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000770114800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Metabolomics offers an approach for characterizing biofluid metabolic changes, but studies focusing on diabetic nephropathy are limited due to the loss of tissue-specific metabolic information. A microdialysis application for the sampling of intact endogenous metabolites has been developed, utilizing two probes simultaneously inserted into the kidney tissues and jugular vein of rats with type 2 diabetes. The comprehensive and quantitative analysis of 20 diagnostic biomarkers closely realated to type 2 diabetes and its complications were performed. Results indicated that amino acid and nucleotide levels were lower in diabetic rats, revealing that the metabolic pathways of amino acid, as well as purine and pyrimidine, were disturbed. Targeted metabolomics using mass spectrometry was performed to find potential therapeutic biomarkers and related metabolic pathways of Gardenia jasminoides (G. jasminoides) for treating diabetes. Results suggested that seven biomarkers in the kidney and five biomarkers in the blood were related to G. jasminoides. In addition, the marked perturbations of pathways were regulated after treatment with G. jasminoides, including amino acid metabolism and purine metabolism.

Recently, it has been found that finerenone, a novel nonsteroidal selective MR antagonist, can robustly improve cardiorenal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and a wide spectrum of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the mechanisms underlying the cardiorenal benefits of finerenone are poorly understood. Further, whether the clinical benefits are mediated by an improvement in vascular stiffness is not confirmed. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate the effects of finerenone on vascular stiffness as assessed using cardio ankle vascular index (CAVI) and relevant cardiorenal biomarkers in patients with T2D and CKD.Methods The Effects of Finerenone on Vascular Stiffness and Cardiorenal Biomarkers in Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease (FIVE-STAR) is an ongoing, investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial in Japan.

Biomarkers potentially modifiable with lifestyle changes deserve a special interest. Our aims were to analyze: (a) The associations of lysine, 2-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA) or pipecolic acid with the risk of T2D or CVD in the PREDIMED trial; (b) the effect of the dietary intervention on 1-year changes in these metabolites, and (c) whether the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) interventions can modify the effects of these metabolites on CVD or T2D risk. Methods Two unstratified case-cohort studies nested within the PREDIMED trial were used. For CVD analyses, we selected 696 non-cases and 221 incident CVD cases; for T2D, we included 610 non-cases and 243 type 2 diabetes incident cases. Metabolites were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, at baseline and after 1-year of intervention. Results In weighted Cox regression models, we found that baseline lysine (HR+1 SD increase = 1.26; 95% CI 1.06-1.51) and 2-AAA (HR+1 SD increase = 1.28; 95% CI 1.05-1.55) were both associated with a higher risk of T2D, but not with CVD. A significant interaction (p = 0.032) between baseline lysine and T2D on the risk of CVD was observed: subjects with prevalent T2D and high levels of lysine exhibited the highest risk of CVD. The intervention with MedDiet did not have a significant effect on 1-year changes of the metabolites. Conclusions Our results provide an independent prospective replication of the association of 2-AAA with future risk of T2D. We show an association of lysine with subsequent CVD risk, which is apparently diabetes-dependent. No evidence of effects of MedDiet intervention on lysine, 2-AAA or pipecolic acid changes was found.

Circulating levels of several amino acids and metabolites related to one-carbon metabolism have been associated with cardiometabolic risk factors and MetS. We aimed to identify the amino acid profile that is significantly associated with MetS among an all male Mediterranean population. Methods and results: One hundred middle-aged men (54.6 +/- 8.9 years) participated in a cross-sectional study carried out during 2011-2012. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria were used to define MetS. Fasting plasma levels of 20 common amino acids and 15 metabolites related to amino acid and one-carbon metabolism were measured using gas chromatography (GC-MS/MS) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Principal components analysis was applied. Fifty-six participants fulfilled the IDF criteria for defining MetS. Five factors were extracted from the 35 measured metabolites. The branched-chain amino acids/aromatic amino acids (BCAA/AAA) related pattern and the glutamine/glycine/serine/asparagine (Gln/Gly/Ser/Asn) related pattern were significantly associated with MetS (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval; 6.41, 2.43-16.91, and 0.47, 0.23-0.96, respectively) after adjustment for age, current smoking status, physical activity level and medical treatment for hypertension, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus. Further adjustment for liver function markers (i.e. glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase, and g-glutamyltransferase), and plasma adiponectin levels did not significantly affect the associations. Conclusion: The BCAA/AAA pattern was positively associated, while the Gln/Gly/Ser/Asn pattern was inversely associated with established cardiometabolic risk factors and MetS. Plasma adiponectin levels or markers of liver function did not significantly affect these associations.

Prognostic biomarkers of disease progression have thus been the focus of intense research, but none are part of routine practice. Objectives To identify and catalogue candidate biomarkers of disease progression in psoriasis for the translational research community. Methods A systematic search of CENTRAL, Embase, LILACS and MEDLINE was performed for relevant articles published between 1990 and December 2021. Eligibility criteria were studies involving patients with psoriasis (any age, n >= 50) reporting biomarkers associated with disease progression. The main outcomes were any measure of skin severity or any prespecified psoriasis comorbidity. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second; studies meeting minimal quality criteria (longitudinal design and/or use of methods to control for confounding) were formally assessed for bias. Candidate biomarkers were identified by an expert multistakeholder group using a majority voting consensus exercise, and mapped to relevant cellular and molecular pathways. Results Of 181 included studies, most investigated genomic or proteomic biomarkers associated with disease severity (n = 145) or psoriatic arthritis (n = 30). Methodological and reporting limitations compromised interpretation of findings, most notably a lack of longitudinal studies, and inadequate control for key prognostic factors. The following candidate biomarkers with future potential utility were identified for predicting disease severity: LCE3D, interleukin (IL)23R, IL23A, NFKBIL1 loci, HLA-C*06:02 (genomic), IL-17A, IgG aHDL, GlycA, I-FABP and kallikrein 8 (proteomic), tyramine (metabolomic); psoriatic arthritis: HLA-C*06:02, HLA-B*27, HLA-B*38, HLA-B*08, and variation at the IL23R and IL13 loci (genomic); IL-17A, CXCL10, Mac-2 binding protein, integrin b5, matrix metalloproteinase-3 and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (proteomic) and tyramine and mucic acid (metabolomic); and type 2 diabetes mellitus: variation in IL12B and IL23R loci (genomic). No biomarkers were supported by sufficient evidence for clinical use without further validation. Conclusions This review provides a comprehensive catalogue of investigated biomarkers of disease progression in psoriasis. Future studies must address the common methodological limitations identified herein to expedite discovery and validation of biomarkers for clinical use.";;"University of London; King's College London; University of London; King's College London; University of York - UK; University of Luxembourg; University of London; University College London; University of Copenhagen; LEO Pharma; UCB Pharma SA; University of Kiel; Schleswig Holstein University Hospital; Technical University of Munich; Karolinska Institutet; University of Copenhagen; University of Lausanne; University of Lausanne; Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV)";;;;;;;;;;36;36;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2022;187;4;;;;;481;493;;10.1111/bjd.21627;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjd.21627;;JUL 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000825804700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Among 949 community-based participants aged >= 40 years without diabetes at baseline, fasting serum fructose levels were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The participants were followed up for the occurrence of diabetes. Cox regression models were performed to analyze the effect of fasting serum fructose levels on risk of incident diabetes. RESULTS During a median of 3.5 years' follow-up, 179 of 949 (18.9%) participants developed type 2 diabetes. Elevated fasting serum fructose levels were associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes in a dose-response manner. After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, lipid profiles, blood pressure, liver function, smoking and drinking status, baseline glucose level, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, a 1-SD increased fasting fructose level was associated with a 35% (95% CI 1.08-1.67) increased risk of developing diabetes. After further adjustment for serum uric acid and estimated glomerular filtration rate, the association was partially attenuated (hazard ratio 1.33 [95% CI 1.07-1.65]). The association was similar by age, prediabetes status, BMI, and family history of diabetes but attenuated in women (Pfor heterogeneity = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS Elevated fasting serum fructose levels were independently associated with increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes in a middle-aged and older Chinese population. Our data suggest that higher fasting serum fructose levels might serve as a biomarker and/or a contributor to incident diabetes.;;"Fudan University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Fudan University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Institute of Nutrition & Health, CAS; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Fudan University; Fudan University";;;;;;;;;;14;17;;;;;;;;;;;SEP;2020;43;9;;;;;2217;2225;;10.2337/dc19-2494;http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc19-2494;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000560813100038;View Full Record in Web of Science

Ophiopogon japonicus is a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat diabetes for thousands of years. From our previous work, we know that MDG-1, a water-soluble beta-D-fructan polysaccharide from O. japonicas could treat T2DM experimentally. However, MDG-1 is poorly absorbed and its mechanism of action is still unknown. Therefore, a GC TOF/MS-based metabonomic approach in combination with multivariate statistical analysis was performed to investigate the mechanism of MDG-1 in a spontaneous diabetic model. Female diabetic KKay mice (21 weeks old) were randomly divided into a diabetic group (n = 6, gavaged with distilled water) and a MDG-1-Diabetic group (n = 7, gavaged with MDG-1, 300 mg kg(-1)) and female C57BL/6 mice (21 weeks old) were set as controls (n = 6, gavaged with distilled water). After 8-weeks of treatment, feces samples were collected for GC-TOF/MS analysis. Consequently, 12 potential biomarkers were identified, including monosugars (D-tagatose, D-lyxose, D-erythrose, xylo-hexos-5-ulose, 2-deoxy-galactose), butanedioic acid, amino acids (phenylalanine, L-lysine, L-methionine, L-aspartic acid) and purine derivatives (7H-purine, 2'-deoxyinosine). We assume the monosugars and butanedioic acid were the fermentation products of MDG-1 by intestinal microbes and MDG-1 actions against diabetes might be accomplished through the absorbable monosugars and butanedioic acid via suppressing intestinal glucose absorption, enhancing liver glycogenesis, inhibiting glycogenolysis and promoting GLP-1 secretion. Besides, MDG-1 might alleviate diabetes and diabetic nephropathy by reducing 7H-purine and 2'-deoxyinosine. Further omics-driven studies including genomics, proteomics and metabonomics were considered to be carried out to provide direct evidence of gut microbiome contribution to MDG-1 actions.;;"Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine";;;;;;;;;;52;62;;;;;;;;;;;;2014;10;2;;;;;304;312;;10.1039/c3mb70392d;http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3mb70392d;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000328953000016;View Full Record in Web of Science

The close relationship between obesity and T2D in children is mainly sustained by insulin resistance (IR). In addition, the cardiometabolic burden of T2D including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome is also strictly related to IR. Although T2D pathophysiology has been largely studied in an attempt to improve therapeutic options, molecular mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. In this perspective, omics approaches (including lipidomics, metabolomics, proteomics and metagenomics) are providing the most attractive therapeutic options for T2D. In particular, distinct both lipids and metabolites are emerging as potential therapeutic tools. Of note, among lipid classes, the pathogenic role of ceramides in T2D context has been supported by several data. Thus, selective changes of ceramides expression might represent innovative therapeutic strategies for T2D treatment. More, distinct metabolomics pathways have been also found to be associated with higher T2D risk, by providing novel potential T2D biomarkers. Taken together, omics data are responsible for the expanding knowledge of T2D pathophysiology, by providing novel insights to improve therapeutic strategies for this tangled disease. We aimed to summarize the most recent evidence in the intriguing field of the omics approaches in T2D both in adults and children.;;Universita della Campania Vanvitelli;;;;;;;;;;6;6;;;;;;;;;;;DEC 15;2021;12;12;;;;;2027;2035;;10.4239/wjd.v12.i12.2027;http://dx.doi.org/10.4239/wjd.v12.i12.2027;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000748523500005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods and Results: To investigate sex differences in HF development and progression, we compared baseline circulating proteins (Olink Cardiovascular II panel) in males and females with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome for the outcome of HF hospitalization. Data were from the placebo-controlled Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin vs Standard of Care (EXAMINE) trial. Pathophysiological sex-differences were interpreted with network and pathway over-representation analyses. The EXAMINE trial enrolled 5380 participants (32.1% females) with biomarker data available for 95.4% of individuals. Analyses revealed 43 biomarkers were differentially expressed in HF hospitalization, of which 18 were sex specific. Among these 43 biomarkers, interleukin-6 was identified as a central node for the pathogenesis of HF hospitalization in both females and in males. Additional pathway over-representation analyses demonstrated that biomarkers associated with inflammatory pathways related to endothelial dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis were more up-regulated in females than males with HF hospitalization. Differential expression of 3 biomarkers (pentraxin-related protein 3, hydroxyacid oxidase 1, and carbonic anhydrase 5A) was independently associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalization in females but not in males (interaction P < .05). Conclusions: In males and females with type 2 diabetes and acute coronary syndrome, interleukin-6 seems to be central in the pathogenesis of HF. Females exhibit higher levels of circulating proteins related to immunological pathways, reflecting sex-specific differences underlying HF development and progression.";;"McGill University; McGill University; McGill University; CHU de Nancy; Universite de Lorraine; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universidade do Porto; University of Connecticut; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes at various stages of nephropathy were enrolled and we performed lectin microarray analyses (n = 17) and measured urinary excretion of fetuin-A (n = 85). The increased signals of urine samples were observed in Sia alpha 2-6Gal/GalNAc-binding lectins (SNA, SSA, TJA-I) during the progression of diabetic nephropathy. We next isolated sialylated glycoproteins by using SSA-lectin affinity chromatography and identified fetuin-A by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer. Urinary excretion of fetuin-A significantly increased during the progression of albuminuria (A1, 0.40 +/- 0.43; A2, 0.60 +/- 0.53; A3 1.57 +/- 1.13 ng/gCr; p = 7.29x10(-8)) and of GFR stages (G1, 0.39 +/- 0.39; G2, 0.49 +/- 0.45; G3, 1.25 +/- 1.18; G4, 1.34 +/- 0.80 ng/gCr; p = 3.89x10(-4)). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to assess fetuin-A as a risk for diabetic nephropathy with microalbuminuria or GFR<60 mL/min.

Plasma metabolomics analysis was conducted in healthy control subjects (n = 25) and patients with NAFL (n = 42) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, n = 19) by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and liquid chromatography-MS/MS as well as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses on liver tissues from patients with varying stages of NAFLD (n = 12). The resulting metabolomic data were subjected to routine statistical and ML-based analyses and multi-omics interpretation with RNA-seq data. We found 6 metabolites that were significantly altered in NAFLD among 79 detected metabolites. Random-forest and multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that eight metabolites (glutamic acid, cis-aconitic acid, aspartic acid, isocitric acid, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, oxaloacetic acid, myristoleic acid, and tyrosine) could distinguish the three groups. Then, the recursive partitioning and regression tree algorithm selected three metabolites (glutamic acid, isocitric acid, and aspartic acid) from these eight metabolites. With these three metabolites, we formulated an equation, the MetaNASH score that distinguished NASH with excellent performance. In addition, metabolic map construction and correlation assays integrating metabolomics data into the transcriptome datasets of the liver showed correlations between the concentration of plasma metabolites and the expression of enzymes governing metabolism and specific alterations of these correlations in NASH. Therefore, these findings will be useful for evaluation of altered metabolism in NASH and understanding of pathophysiologic implications from metabolite profiles in relation to NAFLD progression.;;"Sunchon National University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Gachon University; Gachon University; Gachon University; Gachon University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Gachon University";;;;;;;;;;18;18;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2022;10;7;;;;;;;1669;10.3390/biomedicines10071669;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines10071669;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000833296600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

A simple and selective hydrophilic interaction chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for the simultaneous determination of these amino acids in human serum, using stable isotope-labeled amino acids as internal standards. Chromatographic separation was carried out on a Syncronis HILIC column (150mm x 2.1 mm, 5 mu m) with the column temperature of 35 degrees C and a mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile/120 mM ammonium acetate (89: 11, v/v), and the run time was 11.0 min. The mass spectrometric analysis was performed using a QTRAP 5500 mass spectrometer coupled with an electrospray ionization source in positive ion mode. As these five amino acids are endogenous compounds in serum, we used the corresponding stable isotope-labeled amino acids to evaluate the matrix effect and recovery in serum. The matrix effect was 98.7-107.3%, and the recovery was 92.7-102.3%. Calibration curves spiked unlabeled amino acids in water were linear over the range of 0.200-100 mu g/mL.

Detailed exploration of the transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic composition of islet cells provides a platform for defining cellular function. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing approaches is enabling ever more complete inventories of the islet transcriptome, and these data are already providing important insights into islet biology. For example, transcriptome data have contributed to: (a) definition of transcript candidacy at T2D-associated loci; (b) identification of novel disease biomarkers; (c) characterisation of novel regulatory mechanisms (such as those involving non-coding RNAs), and (d) discovery of factors of potential relevance to beta-cell reprogramming efforts.

However, whether adipsin has any independent association with risk factors and biomarkers in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains elusive.Research design and methods We performed an oral glucose tolerance test on a subset of 43 patients with T2D from the community health cohort to access the role of adipsin in insulin secretion. We further cross-sectionally examined the role of adipsin in plasma, adipose tissue (AT), and secretion in a community cohort of 353 subjects and a hospital cohort of 52 subjects.Results We found that plasma adipsin has no significant correlation with insulin secretion in people with diabetes. Among the risk factors of T2D, adipsin levels were independently associated only with age, and a positive correlation between plasma adipsin and age among subjects without T2D was lost in patients with T2D. Plasma adipsin levels, AT adipsin expression, and secretion were upregulated both in T2D and aging, with a corresponding drop in Homeostatic Model Assessment for assessing beta-cell function. Adipsin expression was positively associated with other aging biomarkers, such as beta-galactosidase, p21, and p16. These results also corroborated with existing plasma proteomic signatures of aging, including growth, and differentiation factor-15, which strongly correlated with adipsin.Conclusions Our results demonstrate an increase in circulating adipsin in T2D and aging, and it scores as a candidate plasma marker for aging specifically in non-T2D population.;;"Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB); Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR); Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB)";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;AUG 29;2024;12;4;;;;;;;e004179;10.1136/bmjdrc-2024-004179;http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjdrc-2024-004179;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001334573000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

We hypothesized that those biomarkers indicative of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) seen in large vessel occlusion (LVO) may also be elevated in T2D and further enhanced by stress conditions; therefore, these proteins represent potentially predictive biomarkers for those T2D patients at high risk of AIS.Methods: We performed an exploratory proteomic analysis in control subjects (n = 23) versus those with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (n = 23) who underwent a hyperinsulinemic clamp study to transient severe hypoglycemia [blood glucose <2.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dl)] in a prospective case-control study. We compared these proteins described as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for AIS due to LVO: lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor-1 (LYVE1), thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP), and cadherin 1 (CDH1).Results: At baseline (BL), PPBP (p < 0.05), THBS1 (p < 0.05), and CDH1 (p < 0.01) were elevated in T2D; LYVE1 was not different between controls and T2D subjects at BL or at subsequent timepoints. PPBP and THBS1 tended to increase at hypoglycemia in both cohorts, though reached significance only in controls (p < 0.05), returning to BL levels post-hypoglycemia. CDH1 levels were higher in T2D at BL, at hypoglycemia and up to 2-h posthypoglycemia, thereafter reverting to BL levels.Conclusion: Elevated levels of PPBP, THBS1, and CDH1, circulatory proteins suggested as biomarkers of AIS due to LVO, may, in T2D patients, be prognostically indicative of a cohort of T2D patients at increased risk of ischaemic stroke.

Methods: Proteomic biomarkers were measured in baseline fasting plasma from 958 Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II participants whose baseline and, in those returning for follow-up (n = 764), Year 4 fundus photographs were graded for DR presence/severity. The performance of PromarkerD (three biomarkers and readily available clinical variables which identify prevalent DKD and predict incident DKD and estimated glomerular filtration rate decline >_30% over four years) for detecting DR prevalence, progression and incidence was assessed using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Logistic regression determined whether individual proteins were associated with DR outcomes after adjusting for the most parsimonious model. Results: Plasma apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4) was independently associated with moderate non-proliferative DR at baseline (OR (95% CI): 1.64 (1.01, 2.67), P = 0.047). Model discrimination was poor for all PromarkerD predicted probabilities against all DR outcomes (AUC <= 0.681). Conclusions: PromarkerD and its constituent biomarkers were not consistently associated with DR prevalence or temporal change. APOA4 was associated with prevalent DR, but not DR incidence or progression. Distinct pathophysiological mechanisms may underlie DKD and DR. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that specific plasma 1-deoxysphingolipids associate with DN severity, and that alterations in plasma serine and alanine associate with 1-deoxysphingolipid elevation in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We examined individual 1-deoxysphingolipid species using LC/ MS/MS in plasma samples from 75 individuals including lean controls (LC, n = 19), those with obesity (n = 19), obesity with T2D without DN (ob/T2D, n = 18), and obesity with T2D with DN (Ob/T2D/DN, n = 19). We ob-served a step wise increase in 1-deoxydihydroceramides across these four groups (spearman correlation coeffi-cient r = 0.41, p = 0.0002). Mean total concentrations of 1-deoxydihydroceramides, and most individual 1-deoxydihydroceramide species, were higher in ob/T2D/DN versus LC group (8.939 vs. 5.195 pmol/100 mu L for total 1-deoxydihydroceramides p = 0.005). No significant differences in 1-deoxydihydroceramides were ob-served between the ob/T2D and ob/T2D/DN groups. L-alanine was higher and L-serine lower in ob/T2D/DN ver-sus LC groups (326.2 vs. 248.0 mu M, p = 0.0086 and 70.2 vs. 89.8 mu M, p = 0.0110), consistent with a potential contribution of these changes to the observed 1-deoxysphingolipids profiles. 1-deoxydihydroceramides corre-lated inversely with leg intraepidermal nerve fiber density (CC-0.40, p = 0.003). These findings indicate that 1-deoxydihydroceramides may be important biomarkers and/or mediators of DN. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: We selected stored samples (12 per group) from a cohort study of patients with Type 2 diabetes and CACS > 1000 or < 100 Agatston units, with matching for age, BMI, blood pressure, lipids and lipoproteins and fibrinogen. Multiplex, immunobead-based assay or ELISA measured 18 cardiovascular-related protein biomarkers. SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) screened for proteins differing significantly between high and low CACS. Results: Only monocyte chemotactic protein-1 was higher in the high compared with the low CACS group but concentrations overlapped appreciably. On SELDI-TOF MS, several mass/charge ratio peak intensities significantly discriminated high and low CACS but these differences were not confirmed in larger samples from the cohort. Conclusions: Plasma protein biomarkers are unlikely to provide an effective alternative to measurement of CACS. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A complete cure is very hard to achieve once the disease has been diagnosed, therefore the diagnosis of early stages in diabetic nephropathy has become a hot area. Numbers of molecules have been proposed to be potential biomarkers for this purpose. However, some problems still remain, such as discovering effective biomarkers to diagnose the disease before obvious clinical evidence appears. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to find plasma biomarkers for early diagnosis of type 2 diabetic nephropathy stage 1 and stage 2, as well as separating them from diabetes. 182 subjects (Chinese) were recruited for this study, including 50 healthy controls, 33 type 2 diabetic patients and 99 type 2 diabetic nephropathy patients (33 of these were stage 3). Important clinical indicators including proteinuria, serum creatinine, and urea nitrogen were measured and the glomerular filtration rate was estimated to assess kidney function; fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin were measured to assess the blood glucose control. Key metabolites and genes in plasma samples were identified and determined using -omic and quantitative techniques. The potential biomarkers were then combined and carefully screened to determine the most informative ones for early diagnosis of type 2 diabetic nephropathy. An integrated biomarker system (IBS) incorporating 6 clinical indicators, 40 metabolites and 5 genes was established. Correlation analysis results revealed that most of the potential biomarkers significantly correlated with the 6 clinical indicators. Discriminant analysis results showed that the developed IBS gave the highest total predictive accuracy (98.9%). Significant test and receiver operating characteristic analysis results indicated that inosine had the highest sensitivity (0.889), specificity (1.000), positive predictive rate (1.000) and negative predictive rate (0.900) amongst the 48 potential biomarkers when separating patients with diabetes from patients with diabetic nephropathy stage 3. Finally, inosine with a cutoff of 0.086 mg L-1 was combined with estimated GFR to differentiate between diabetic nephropathy stages 1 and 2 from diabetes. The results demonstrate that IBS combined with a proper statistical analysis technique is a powerful tool for biomarker screening.";;"Tsinghua University; East China University of Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, CAS; China-Japan Friendship Hospital; East China University of Science & Technology";;;;;;;;;;27;34;;;;;;;;;;;;2013;9;8;;;;;2134;2141;;10.1039/c3mb25543c;http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3mb25543c;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000321199100016;View Full Record in Web of Science

Hyperglycemia results in a state of oxidative stress, which may contribute to the production of insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction and long-term complications of diabetes. Novel approaches are required for prevention and treatment of diabetes. New biomarkers that can be used in risk stratification and therapy control as supplementary'to current parameters are needed. These biomarkers may facilitate a more individualized and sufficient treatment of diabetes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the levels of oxidatively induced DNA damage products, 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) (also known as 8-OH-dG), (5'R)- and (5'S)-8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosines (R-cdA and S-cdA), and the lipid peroxidation product 8-iso-prostaglandin F-2 alpha, (8-iso-PGF(2 alpha)) as reliable oxidative stress markers in patients with prediabetes or T2DM in comparison with healthy volunteers. Urine samples were collected from these subjects. Absolute quantification of 8-oxo-dG, R-cdA, S-cdA and 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) was achieved by liquid chromatography-isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry. The levels of 8-oxo-dG, S-cdA and 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) were significantly greater in prediabetes patients than those in healthy volunteers. T2DM patients also had higher levels of 8-oxo-dG than healthy volunteers. No statistically significant difference was observed for R-cdA levels. 8-Oxo-dG levels positively correlated with R-cdA and S-cdA levels for prediabetes and newly diagnosed T2DM. S-cdA levels and HbAlc were found negatively correlated in prediabetes patients. Also 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) levels and HbAlc were found negatively correlated in prediabetes patients. These results indicate that oxidatively induced macromolecular damage appears before the establishment of T2DM. Thus, our data suggest that oxidatively induced DNA damage and lipid peroxidation products that were found to be elevated in prediabetic stage may be used as early disease markers in patients at risk for T2DM.

However, the importance of m(6)A alteration in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has not been explored. Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate whether m(6)A content was reduced in T2DM patients and whether m(6)A content was correlated with them RNA expression levels of the FTO and ALKBH5 genes. Methods: In this case-control study, peripheral blood samples were obtained from 88 T2DM patients and 92 healthy controls. For the diabetic animal model experiment, blood samples were obtained from seven diabetic and eight nondiabetic rats. A sensitive liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for the determination of the m(6)A content in RNA, quantitative real-time PCR was used to examine the mRNA expression levels of the FTO and ALKBH5 genes, and high-resolution melting and DNA sequencing were used to detect FTO single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Results: Our results showed that the m(6)A contents in the RNA from T2DM patients and diabetic rats were significantly lower compared with the control groups (P = 2.6 x 10(-24) for T2DM patients; P = .001 for diabetic rats, respectively), and T2DM can be characterized by the content of m(6)A. The mRNA expression level of FTO was significantly higher in T2DM patients than that of the controls (P = .0007) and was associated with the risk of T2DM (odds ratio 2.797, 95% confidence interval 1.452-5.389, P = .002). Moreover, the m(6)A contents were correlated with FTO mRNA expression. Conclusions: These data suggest that the increased mRNA expression of FTO could be responsible for the reduction of m(6)A in T2DM, which may further increase the risk of complications of T2DM. Low m(6)A should be investigated further as a novel potential biomarker of T2DM.";;"Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Peking University; University of Texas System; UTMD Anderson Cancer Center";;;;;;;;;;166;186;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2015;100;1;;;;;E148;E154;;10.1210/jc.2014-1893;http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/jc.2014-1893;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000353281300034;View Full Record in Web of Science

RESEACH DESIGN AND METHODS - in a nested case-control study of Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes, baseline (serum creatinine < 1.2 mg/dl and urine albumin excretion < 30 mg/g) and 10-year urine samples were examined. Case subjects (n = 31) developed diabetic nephropathy (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g) over 10 years. Control subjects (n = 3 1) were matched to case subjects (1: 1) according to diabetes duration, age, sex, and BMI but remained normoalbuminuric (albumin-to-creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g) over the same 10 years. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) was performed on baseline urine samples, and training (14 cases:14 controls) and validation (17:17) sets were tested. RESULTS - At baseline, A1C levels differed between case and control subjects. SELDI-TOF MS detected 714 unique urine protein peaks. Of these, a 12-peak proteomic signature correctly predicted 89% of cases of diabetic nepropathy (93% sensitivity, 86% specificity) in the training set. Applying this same signature to the independent validation set yielded an accuracy rate of 74% (71% sensitivity, 76% specificity). In multivariate analyses, the 12-peak signature was independently associated with subsequent diabetic nephropathy when applied to the validation set (odds ratio [OR] 7.9 [95% CI 1.5-43.5], P = 0.017) and the entire dataset (14.5 [3.7-55.6], P = 0.001), and A1C levels were no longer significant.

Methods: Participants were diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and had PWV and/or pulse wave analysis performed. Dietary intake was measured using the Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies Version 2 Food Frequency Questionnaire. Serum lipid species and carotenoids were measured, using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography, as biomarkers of dairy and vegetable intake, respectively. Associations were determined using linear regression adjusted for potential confounders. Results: PWV (n = 95) was inversely associated with reduced fat dairy intake (beta = -0.01; 95% CI -0.02, -0.01; p = 0 < 0.05) in particular yoghurt consumption (beta = -0.04; 95% CI -0.09, -0.01; p = 0 < 0.05) after multivariate adjustment. Total vegetable consumption was negatively associated with PWV in the whole cohort after full adjustment (beta = -0.04; 95% CI -0.07, -0.01; p < 0.05). Individual lipid species, particularly those containing 14:0, 15:0, 16:0, 17:0 and 17:1 fatty acids, known to be of ruminant origin, in lysophosphatidylcholine, cholesterol ester, diacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and triacylglycerol classes were positively associated with intake of full fat dairy, after adjustment for multiple comparisons. However, there was no association between serum lipid species and PWV. There were no dietary predictors of central blood pressure or augmentation index after multivariate adjustment. Conclusion: In this cohort of subjects with diabetes reduced fat dairy intake and vegetable consumption were inversely associated with PWV. The lack of a relationship between serum lipid species and PWV suggests that the fatty acid composition of dairy may not explain the beneficial effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We investigated the potential role of plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) in relation to these processes. Plasma EVs were isolated by size exclusion chromatography in fasting individuals with HIV and T2D (n = 16), T2D only (n = 14), HIV only (n = 20) or healthy controls (n = 19), and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, western blot, nanoparticle tracking analysis and quantitative proteomics. The findings were compared to gut microbiota alterations, lipopolysaccharide levels and cardiovascular risk profile. Individuals with concomitant HIV and T2D had higher plasma EV concentration, which correlated closely with plasma lipopolysaccharides, triglycerides and Framingham score, but not with gut microbiota alterations. Proteomic analyses identified 558 human proteins, largely related to cardiometabolic disease genes and upstream regulation of inflammatory pathways, including IL-6 and IL-1 beta, as well as 30 bacterial proteins, mostly from lipopolysaccharide-producing Proteobacteria. Our study supports that EVs are related to microbial translocation processes in individuals with HIV and T2D. Their proteomic content suggests a contributing role in low-grade inflammation and cardiovascular risk development.

Proteins, products of gene transcription, serve as dynamic biomarkers for pinpointing perturbed pathways in disease development. Previous T2D proteomic association studies primarily focused on European populations.Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between plasma proteins and the incidence of T2D in Asian individuals.Methods We examined the association of 4775 plasma proteins with incident T2D in a Singapore multi-ethnic cohort of 1659 Asian individuals (539 cases and 1120 controls) using logistic regression. We used 2-sample mendelian randomization and colocalization analysis to evaluate the causal relationship between proteins and T2D.Results Our analysis revealed 522 proteins that were associated with incident T2D after adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity, and 17 proteins that remained statistically significantly associated after adjusting for other T2D risk factors such as fasting glucose, waist circumference, and triglycerides. Among the 522 proteins associated with incident T2D, the change in 205 plasma proteins, observed in parallel with the development of T2D at baseline and 6-year follow-up, were further associated with incident T2D. The associated proteins showed enrichment in neuron generation, glycosaminoglycan binding, and insulin-like growth factor binding. Two-sample mendelian randomization analysis suggested 3 plasma proteins, GSTA1, INHBC, and FGL1, play causal roles in the development of T2D, with colocalization evidence supporting GSTA1 and INHBC.Conclusion Our findings reveal plasma protein profiles linked to the onset of T2D in Asian populations, offering insights into the biological mechanisms of T2D development.;;"National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS); University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; National University of Singapore; George Washington University; George Washington University";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;2025 FEB 3;2025;;;;;;;;;;10.1210/clinem/dgaf045;http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaf045;;FEB 2025;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001411350200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Human mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (hUCMSCs-Exo) have diverse functions in improving microcirculation; however, the molecular mechanism of hUCMSCs-Exo in regulating burn-induced inflammation is not well understood.Methods hUCMSCs-Exo were extracted by hypervelocity centrifugation method, and exosome morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy, exosome diameter distribution was detected by particle size analysis, and exosome specific proteins were identified by Western blot.2. DB/DB mice were randomly divided into exosomes group and PBS group. Exosomes and PBS were injected into the tail vein, respectively, and the calf muscle tissue was taken 28 days later. 0.5% Evans blue fluorescence assessment microvascular permeability. The expression of CD31 was detected by immunofluorescence.The morphology and function of microvessels in muscle tissue of lower limbs was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy.3. TMT proteomics was used to detect the changes of differential protein expression in lower limb muscle tissues of the PBS group and the exosome group, and data analysis was performed to screen key signal molecules and their involved biological pathways. Key signal molecules CD105 were verified by Western blot. The expression of TGF-beta 1 in exosomes were evaluated by Western blot.Results Electron microscopy showed that hUCMSCs-Exo presented a uniform vesicle structure, and NTA showed that its diameter was about 160 nm. Western blot showed positive expression of specific proteins CD9, CD81 and TSG101 on exosomes.2. There is no significant change in blood glucose and body weight before and after the exosome treatment. The exosome group can significantly reduce the exudation of Evans blue. Compared with the PBS group. Meanwhile, CD31 immunofluorescence showed that the red fluorescence of exosome treatment was significantly increased, which was higher than that of PBS group. Transmission electron microscopy showed smooth capillary lumen and smooth and complete surface of endothelial cells in the exosome group, while narrow capillary lumen and fingerlike protrusion of endothelial cells in the PBS group.3.Quantitative analysis of TMT proteomics showed that there were 82 differential proteins, including 49 down-regulated proteins and 33 up-regulated proteins. Go enrichment analysis showed that the differential proteins were involved in molecular function, biological process, cell components, among which CD105 was one of the up-regulated proteins. Through literature search, CD105 was found to be related to endothelial cell proliferation. Therefore, this study verified the changes of CD105 in the exosome group, and it was used as the mechanism study of this study. 4. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of CD105 protein in lower limb muscle tissue of exosome group was significantly increased compared with that of PBS group. Based on the fact that CD105 is a component of the TGF-beta 1 receptor complex and exosomes are rich in growth factors and cytokines, this study further examined the expression of TGF-beta 1 in exosomes, and the results showed that exosomes had high expression of TGF-beta 1.Conclusion By improving the integrity of microvascular endothelial cells, hUCMSCs-Exo can improve the permeability of microvessels in diabetic lower muscle tissue, further promote the proliferation of lower limb muscle cells and inhibit the apoptosis of tissue cells. The mechanism may be associated with exosomes rich in TGF-beta 1, which is likely to promote endothelial cell proliferation and improve permeability through binding to the endothelial CD105/T beta R-II receptor complex, while promoting angiogenesis and protecting skeletal muscle cells from apoptosis.";;"Anhui Medical University; Tongji University; Tongji University; Zhengzhou University; Anhui University of Science & Technology; Tongji University";;;;;;;;;;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 15;2023;15;1;;;;;;;234;10.1186/s13098-023-01191-x;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13098-023-01191-x;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001105437600002;View Full Record in Web of Science

This cross-sectional analysis of a multi-ethnic cohort aimed to search for proteins potentially involved in the susceptibility to salt sensitivity, hypertension, and hypertension-related complications. The study included individuals enrolled in African Prospective Study on the Early Detection and Identification of Cardiovascular Disease and Hypertension (African-PREDICT), Flemish Study of the Environment, Genes and Health Outcomes (FLEMENGHO), Prospective Cohort Study in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for Validation of Biomarkers (PROVALID)-Austria, and Urinary Proteomics Combined with Home Blood Pressure Telemonitoring for Health Care Reform Trial (UPRIGHT-HTM). Sequenced urinary peptides detectable in 70% of participants allowed the identification of parental proteins and were compared between Blacks and Whites. Of 513 urinary peptides, 300 had significantly different levels among healthy Black (n = 476) and White (n = 483) South Africans sharing the same environment. Analyses contrasting 582 Blacks versus 1731 Whites, and Sub-Saharan Blacks versus European Whites replicated the findings. COL4A1, COL4A2, FGA, PROC, MGP, MYOCD, FYXD2, and UMOD were identified as the most likely candidates underlying the racially different susceptibility to salt sensitivity, hypertension, and related complications. Enriched pathways included hemostasis, platelet activity, collagens, biology of the extracellular matrix, and protein digestion and absorption. Our study suggests that MGP and MYOCD being involved in cardiovascular function, FGA and PROC in coagulation, FYXD2 and UMOD in salt homeostasis, and COL4A1 and COL4A2 as major components of the glomerular basement membrane are among the many proteins potentially incriminated in the higher susceptibility of Blacks compared to Whites to salt sensitivity, hypertension, and its complication. Nevertheless, these eight proteins and their associated pathways deserve further exploration in molecular and human studies as potential targets for intervention to reduce the excess risk of hypertension and cardiovascular complications in Blacks versus Whites.;;"Shanghai Jiao Tong University; KU Leuven; Hasselt University; North West University - South Africa; Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH (MOS); Medical University of Innsbruck; University Medical Centre Ljubljana; University of Glasgow; Jagiellonian University; KU Leuven; University of New South Wales Sydney; KU Leuven";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;2024 NOV 24;2024;;;;;;;;;;10.1002/pmic.202400207;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pmic.202400207;;NOV 2024;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001361584200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The key is the ion-pair information collection from samples to be analyzed. It is well-known that sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical Fragment ion (SWATH) MS mode can acquire MS2 information to a maximum extent. To expediently acquire as many ion-pairs as possible with optimal collision energy (CE), an ion-pair selection approach based on SWATH MS acquisition with variable isolation windows was developed in this study. Initially, nontargeted acquisition of all metabolites information in plasma Standard Reference Material (SRM 1950) was performed by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS platform with three CEs. With the help of software tool, the ion-pairs of unique metabolites were gained. Then they were validated in scheduled MRM coupled with UHPLC. After removing false positive, the ion-pairs with an optimal CE was integrated. A total of 1373 unique metabolite ion-pairs were obtained at positive ion mode. And repeatability of the established pseudotargeted approach was evaluated by intraday and interday precision. The results demonstrated the method was stable, reliable, and suitable for metabolomics study. As an application example, alterations of serum metabolites in Type 2 diabetes were investigated by using the established method. This work provides a pseudotargeted ion-pair selection method based on SWATH MS acquisition with the characters of increased metabolite coverage, suitable CE, and convenient processing.;;"Chinese Academy of Sciences; Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, CAS; Dalian University of Technology; Dalian University of Technology; STATE KEY LABORATORY SURFACTANT FINE CHEMISTRY; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS";;;;;;;;;;35;40;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 2;2018;90;19;;;;;11401;11408;;10.1021/acs.analchem.8b02377;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b02377;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000446542600034;View Full Record in Web of Science

We investigated the differences in plasma lipid concentrations in 63 participants categorized into six groups (middle-aged Korean men); Normal, Pre-diabetes (pre-DM), and Diabetes mellitus (DM) with or without abdominal obesity (AO or lean). The lipidomic profiles were determined by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sphingomyelin (SM) levels in plasma were significantly higher in the pre-DM with AO than in pre-DM with lean (p = 0.021).

However, the mechanism of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression in this high-risk group is poorly understood. Objective This work aimed to identify novel biomarkers and potential causal proteins associated with DKD progression in patients with YT2D. Methods Among YT2D (T2D onset age <40 years), 144 DKD progressors (cases) were matched for T2D onset age, sex, and ethnicity with 292 nonprogressors (controls) and divided into discovery and validation sets. DKD progression was defined as decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 3 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater or 40% decline in eGFR from baseline. A total of 1472 plasma proteins were measured through a multiplex immunoassay that uses a proximity extension assay technology. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify proteins associated with DKD progression. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to evaluate causal relationship between plasma proteins and DKD progression. Results Forty-two plasma proteins were associated with DKD progression, independent of traditional cardiorenal risk factors, baseline eGFR, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. The proteins identified were related to inflammatory and remodeling biological processes. Our findings suggest angiogenin as one of the top signals (odds ratio = 5.29; 95% CI, 2.39-11.73; P = 4.03 x 10-5). Furthermore, genetically determined plasma angiogenin level was associated with increased odds of DKD progression. Conclusion Large-scale proteomic analysis identified novel proteomic biomarkers for DKD progression in YT2D.

We identified dozens of markers with highly significant associations with future T2DM across 2 large longitudinal cohorts (n = 2839) followed for up to 16 years. We leveraged proteomic, metabolomic, genetic, and clinical data from humans to nominate 1 specific candidate to test for potential causal relationships in model systems. Our studies identified functional effects of aminoacylase 1 (ACY1), a top protein association with future T2DM risk, on amino acid metabolism and insulin homeostasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a loss-of-function variant associated with circulating levels of the biomarker WAP, Kazal, immunoglobulin, Kunitz, and NTR domain-containing protein 2 (WFIKKN2) was, in turn, associated with fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and HOMA-IR measurements in humans.

Here, we present a streamlined mass spectrometry-based platform for identifying and characterizing low-abundance regulatory peptides in humans. We demonstrate the clinical applicability of this platform by studying a hitherto neglected glucose-and appetite-regulating gut hormone, namely, oxyntomodulin. Our results show that the secretion of oxyntomodulin in patients with type 2 diabetes is significantly impaired, and that its level is increased by more than 10-fold after gastric bypass surgery. Furthermore, we report that oxyntomodulin is co-distributed and co-secreted with the insulin-stimulating and appetite-regulating gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), is inactivated by the same protease (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) as GLP-1 and acts through its receptor. Thus, oxyntomodulin may participate with GLP-1 in the regulation of glucose metabolism and appetite in humans. In conclusion, this mass spectrometry-based platformis a powerful resource for identifying and characterizing metabolically active low-abundance peptides. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Clinical trials aiming for earlier prevention of diabetic nephropathy by renin angiotensin system blocking treatment in normoalbumuric patients have given mixed results. This might reflect that the large fraction of normoalbuminuric patients are not at risk of progression, thereby reducing power in previous studies. A specific risk classifier based on urinary proteomics (chronic kidney disease (CKD)273) has been shown to identify normoalbuminuric diabetic patients who later progressed to overt kidney disease, and may hold the potential for selection of high-risk patients for early intervention. Combining the ability of CKD273 to identify patients at highest risk of progression with prescription of preventive aldosterone blockade only to this high-risk population will increase power. We aim to confirm performance of CKD273 in a prospective multicentre clinical trial and test the ability of spironolactone to delay progression of early diabetic nephropathy. Methods and analysis Investigator-initiated, prospective multicentre clinical trial, with randomised double-masked placebo-controlled intervention and a prospective observational study. We aim to include 3280 type 2 diabetic participants with normoalbuminuria. The CKD273 classifier will be assessed in all participants. Participants with high-risk pattern are randomised to treatment with spironolactone 25mg once daily, or placebo, whereas, those with low-risk pattern will be observed without intervention other than standard of care. Treatment or observational period is 3years. The primary endpoint is development of confirmed microalbuminuria in 2 of 3 first morning voids urine samples. Ethics and dissemination The study will be conducted under International Conference on Harmonisation - Good clinical practice (ICH-GCP) requirements, ethical principles of Declaration of Helsinki and national laws. This first new biomarker-directed intervention trial aiming at primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy may pave the way for personalised medicine approaches in treatment of diabetes complications.

The aim of this investigation was to assess, by a multimarker mass spectrometry approach, the predictive role of circulating proteins as biomarkers of cardiovascular damage progression associated with diabetes mellitus.Methods The study considered 34 patients with both T2DM and CHD, 31 patients with T2DM and without CHD, and 30 patients without diabetes with a diagnosis of CHD. Plasma samples of subjects were analysed through a multiplexed targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based assay, namely Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM), allowing the simultaneous detection of peptides derived from a protein of interest. Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis was employed to identify enriched GO terms in the biological process, molecular function, or cellular component categories. Non-parametric multivariate methods were used to classify samples from patients and evaluate the relevance of the analysed proteins' panel.Results A total of 81 proteins were successfully quantified in the human plasma samples. Gene Ontology analysis assessed terms related to blood microparticles, extracellular exosomes and collagen-containing extracellular matrix. Preliminary evaluation using analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the differences in the proteomic profile among patient groups identified 13 out of the 81 proteins as significantly different. Multivariate analysis, including cluster analysis and principal component analysis, identified relevant grouping of the 13 proteins. The first main cluster comprises apolipoprotein C-III, apolipoprotein C-II, apolipoprotein A-IV, retinol-binding protein 4, lysozyme C and cystatin-C; the second one includes, albeit with sub-grouping, alpha 2 macroglobulin, afamin, kininogen 1, vitronectin, vitamin K-dependent protein S, complement factor B and mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves obtained with the 13 selected proteins using a nominal logistic regression indicated a significant overall distinction (p < 0.001) among the three groups of subjects, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) ranging 0.91-0.97, and sensitivity and specificity ranging from 85 to 100%.Conclusions Targeted mass spectrometry approach indicated 13 multiple circulating proteins as possible biomarkers of cardiovascular damage progression associated with T2DM, with excellent classification results in terms of sensitivity and specificity.";;"University of Padua; IRCCS Centro Cardiologico Monzino; University of Padua; Fondazione Citta della Speranza";;;;;;;;;;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;JAN 20;2024;23;1;;;;;;;36;10.1186/s12933-024-02125-1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12933-024-02125-1;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001146259400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) activation protected insulin-deficient diabetic mice from hyperglycemia-induced glomerular pathology. This study aims to extend these findings in a separate cohort of individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and discover new circulatory biomarkers for renal protection through proteomics and metabolomics of Medalists' plasma. We hypothesize that increased glycolytic flux and improved mitochondrial biogenesis will halt the progression of diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Immunoblots analyzed selected glycolytic and mitochondrial enzymes in postmortem glomeruli of non-Medalists with type 1 diabetes (n = 15), type 2 diabetes (n = 19), and no diabetes (n = 5). Plasma proteomic (SOMAscan) (n = 180) and metabolomic screens (n = 214) of Medalists with and without stage 3b chronic kidney disease (CKD) were conducted and significant markers validated by ELISA. RESULTS Glycolytic (PKM1, PKM2, and ENO1) and mitochondrial (MTCO2) enzymes were significantly elevated in glomeruli of CKD- versus CKD+ individuals with type 2 diabetes. Medalists' plasma PKM2 correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (r(2) = 0.077; P = 0.0002). Several glucose and mitochondrial enzymes in circulation were upregulated with corresponding downregulation of toxic metabolites in CKD-protected Medalists. Amyloid precursor protein was also significantly upregulated, tumor necrosis factor receptors downregulated, and both confirmed by ELISA. CONCLUSIONS Elevation of enzymes involved in the metabolism of intracellular free glucose and its metabolites in renal glomeruli is connected to preserving kidney function in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The renal profile of elevated glycolytic enzymes and reduced toxic glucose metabolites is reflected in the circulation, supporting their use as biomarkers for endogenous renal protective factors in people with diabetes.";;"Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Joslin Diabetes Center, Inc.; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Folkhalsan Research Center; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; Helsinki University Central Hospital; AstraZeneca; Sanofi-Aventis; Sanofi Germany; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Sanofi-Aventis; Genzyme Corporation";;;;;;;;;;71;78;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2019;42;7;;;;;1263;1273;;10.2337/dc18-2585;http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc18-2585;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000472196700029;View Full Record in Web of Science

We aim to examine how added sugar and SSB intake associate with 136 measured plasma proteins and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the Malmo Diet and Cancer-Cardiovascular Cohort (n = 4382), and examine if the identified added sugar- and SSB-associated proteins associate with T2D incidence. A two-step iterative resampling approach was used to internally replicate proteins that associated with added sugar and SSB intake. Nine proteins were identified to associate with added sugar intake, of which only two associated with T2D incidence (p < 0.00045). Seven proteins were identified to associate with SSB intake, of which six associated strongly with T2D incidence (p < 6.9 x 10(-8)). No significant associations were observed between added sugar and SSB intake and CRP concentrations. In summary, our elucidation of the relationship between plasma proteome and added sugar and SSB intake, in relation to future T2D risk, demonstrated that SSB intake, rather than the total intake of added sugar, was related to a T2D-pathological proteomic signature. However, external replication is needed to verify the findings.;;Lund University;;;;;;;;;;15;15;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2020;12;10;;;;;;;3129;10.3390/nu12103129;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu12103129;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000585362000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Accumulating evidence indicates a connection between these two diseases at the molecular level. Much of what we currently know about T2D and AD is derived from in vivo and in vitro studies. However, further research and characterization of molecules is necessary to establish a strong connection between T2D and AD. In silico studies play a major role in finding non-evident patterns of gene expression and gene network connectivity. In this review, we give a brief introduction to T2D and AD and then describe the risk factors and molecules that are commonly associated with these diseases. Finally, we discuss the future directions and applications of bioinformatics that can provide greater insight into the relationship between these two diseases. Analysis and integration of high-throughput data on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics from normal and disease tissues would be very useful to improve our understanding of the mechanism behind disease initiation and the connection between these two diseases. We encourage researchers to use bioinformatics approaches to identify genes and their regulatory pathways that are commonly affected in T2D and AD, as these genes and pathways could be potential biomarkers and targets for disease treatment.;;"Aligarh Muslim University; Aligarh Muslim University; King Abdulaziz University; Universiti Sains Malaysia";;;;;;;;;;22;23;;;;;;;;;;;;2014;13;2;;;;;312;321;;10.2174/18715273113126660133;http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/18715273113126660133;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000340835800016;View Full Record in Web of Science

We previously reported that plasma levels of N-epsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) were decreased in obese subjects resulting from CML accumulation in adipose tissue and that this CML accumulation plays an important role in adipose tissue inflammation. The objective of this study is to investigate associations between obesity (body mass index, waist circumference, and trunk fat mass), plasma CML (as an inversely correlated marker of CML accumulation in adipose tissue), and low-grade inflammation (LGI) in a large sample of individuals whose weight status ranged from normal to morbid obesity. Approach and Results We studied 1270 individuals of the Cohort on Diabetes and Atherosclerosis Maastricht Study and Hoorn Study, in whom protein-bound CML levels were measured by UPLC-Tandem MS (ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry), and 6 inflammatory markers were measured with multiarrays. These inflammatory markers were compiled into an LGI score. Multiple linear regression, adjusted for covariates, showed that (1) waist circumference was inversely associated with protein-bound CML plasma levels (standardized regression coefficient []=-0.357 [95% confidence interval: -0.414; -0.301]); (2) protein-bound CML was inversely associated with LGI score (=-0.073 [-0.130;-0.015]); and (3) the association between waist circumference and LGI (=0.262 [0.203;0.321]) was attenuated after adjustment for protein-bound CML plasma levels and other potential mediators (to =0.202 [0.138;0.266]), with CML explaining the greatest portion of the attenuation (approximate to 12%). Further analysis with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measures of body composition confirmed a strong inverse association of fat mass preferentially accumulated in the trunk with protein-bound CML plasma levels, significantly explaining approximate to 21% of the trunk fat-LGI association. Conclusions Obesity, in particular central obesity, is characterized by greater levels of LGI but by lower levels of circulating CML; the latter significantly explaining a portion of the positive association between central obesity and inflammation.";;"Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC); University of Queensland; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; VU UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; VU UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER";;;;;;;;;;33;35;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2015;35;12;;;;;2707;2713;;10.1161/ATVBAHA.115.306106;http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/ATVBAHA.115.306106;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000365594100026;View Full Record in Web of Science

However racial and ethnic disparities seems to be a risk factor for their development. Mexico has been named as one of the largest populations with the highest prevalence of diabetes and obesity. The aim of this study was to identify novel T2D-associated proteins in Mexican patients. Blood samples were collected from 62 Mexican patients with T2D and they were grouped according to their body mass index (BMI). A panel of 10 diabetes and obesity serum markers was determined using MAGPIX. A comparative proteomics study was performed using two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) followed by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We detected 113 spots differentially accumulated, in which 64 unique proteins were identified, proteins that were involved in metabolism pathways, molecular transport, and cellular signalling. Four proteins (14-3-3, ApoH, ZAG, and OTO3) showing diabetes-related variation and also changes in relation to obesity were selected for further validation by western blotting. Our results reveal new diabetes related proteins present in the Mexican population.

Oxidative stress and chronic inflammatory cascades prevalent in individuals with senile diabetes significantly amplify disease progression and complication rates. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) emerges as a pivotal player in enhancing blood sugar homeostasis and retarding complication onset in the clinical management of senile diabetes. Nonetheless, an evident research gap persists regarding the integration of TCM's renal tonification pharmacological mechanisms with experimental validation within the realm of senile diabetes therapeutics. Aims: The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of action of New Shenqi Pills (SQP) in the treatment of SDM and make an experimental assessment. Methods: Network analysis is used to evaluate target pathways related to SQP and SDM. Mitochondrial-related genes were obtained from the MitoCarta3.0 database and intersected with the common target genes of the disease and drugs, then constructing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network making use of the GeneMANIA database. Representative compounds in the SQP were quantitatively measured using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to ensure quality control and quantitative analysis of the compounds. A type 2 diabetes mice (C57BL/6) model was used to investigate the pharmacodynamics of SQP. The glucose lowering efficacy of SQP was assessed through various metrics including body weight and fasting blood glucose (FBG). To elucidate the modulatory effects of SQP on pancreatic beta cell function, we measured oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin histochemical staining and tunel apoptosis detection, then assessed the insulin-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase A (Akt)/glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta) pathway in diabetic mice via Western blotting. Additionally, we observe the structural changes of the nucleus, cytoplasmic granules and mitochondria of pancreatic islet beta cells. Results: In this investigation, we identified a total of 1876 genes associated with senile diabetes, 278 targets of SQP, and 166 overlapping target genes, primarily enriched in pathways pertinent to oxidative stress response, peptide response, and oxygen level modulation. Moreover, an intersection analysis involving 1,136 human mitochondrial genes and comorbidity targets yielded 15 mitochondria-related therapeutic targets. Quality control assessments and quantitative analyses of SQP revealed the predominant presence of five compounds with elevated concentrations: Catalpol, Cinnamon Aldehyde, Rehmanthin D, Trigonelline, and Paeonol Phenol. Vivo experiments demonstrated notable findings. Relative to the control group, mice in the model group exhibited significant increases in body weight and fasting blood glucose levels, alongside decreased insulin secretion and heightened islet cell apoptosis. Moreover, beta-cells nuclear condensation and mitochondrial cristae disappearance were observed, accompanied by reduced expression levels of p-GSK-3 beta protein in islet cells (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Conversely, treatment groups administered SQP and Rg displayed augmented expressions of the aforementioned protein markers (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), alongside preserved mitochondrial cristae structure in islet beta cells. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that SQP can ameliorate diabetes by reducing islet cell apoptosis and resist oxidative stress. These insulin-mediated PI3K/AKT/GSK-3 beta pathway plays an important regulatory role in this process.;;"Guang'anmen Hospital, CACMS; Beijing University of Chinese Medicine";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;JUN 12;2024;15;;;;;;;;1339758;10.3389/fphar.2024.1339758;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2024.1339758;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001258069400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Given the crucial role of proteins in various biological processes, this study aimed to elucidate the aetiological role and predictive performance of protein biomarkers on incident CHD in individuals with and without T2D. Methods The discovery cohort included 1492 participants from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) S4 study with 147 incident CHD cases (45 vs. 102 cases in the group with T2D and without T2D, respectively) during 15.6 years of follow-up. The validation cohort included 888 participants from the KORA-Age1 study with 70 incident CHD cases (19 vs. 51 cases in the group with T2D and without T2D, respectively) during 6.9 years of follow-up. We measured 233 plasma proteins related to cardiovascular disease and inflammation using proximity extension assay technology. Associations of proteins with incident CHD were assessed using Cox regression and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Predictive models were developed using priority-Lasso and were evaluated on top of Framingham risk score variables using the C-index, category-free net reclassification index (cfNRI), and relative integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Results We identified two proteins associated with incident CHD in individuals with and 29 in those without baseline T2D, respectively. Six of these proteins are novel candidates for incident CHD. MR suggested a potential causal role for hepatocyte growth factor in CHD development. The developed four-protein-enriched model for individuals with baseline T2D (Delta C-index: 0.017; cfNRI: 0.253; IDI: 0.051) and the 12-protein-enriched model for individuals without baseline T2D (Delta C-index: 0.054; cfNRI: 0.462; IDI: 0.024) consistently improved CHD prediction in the discovery cohort, while in the validation cohort, significant improvements were only observed for selected performance measures (with T2D: cfNRI: 0.633; without T2D: Delta C-index: 0.038; cfNRI: 0.465).

A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies. The review utilizes advanced analytical technologies such as mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of semaglutide on insulin secretion, weight control, anti-inflammatory activities and lipid metabolism. These omics approaches offer critical insights into metabolic changes associated with cardiovascular health. However, challenges remain such as individual variability in expression, the need for comprehensive validation and the integration of these data with clinical parameters. These issues need to be addressed through further research to refine these indicators and increase their clinical utility.ConclusionFuture integration of proteomic and metabolomic data with artificial intelligence (AI) promises to improve prediction and monitoring of cardiovascular outcomes and may enable more accurate and effective management of cardiovascular health in patients with type 2 diabetes.

The three comparison groups were set up in this study, T2DM-4w group vs. NG, T2DM-12w group vs. T2DM-4w group, and T2DM-24w group vs. T2DM-12w group. The metabolite profiles of supraspinatus tendon were obtained using tandem mass spectrometry. Metabolomics multivariate statistics were used for metabolic data analysis and differential metabolite (DEM) determination. The intersection of the three comparison groups' DEMs was defined as key metabolites that changed consistently in the supraspinatus tendon after diabetes induction; then, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was performed.Results T2DM-4w group vs. NG, T2DM-12w group vs. T2DM-4w group, and T2DM-24w group vs. T2DM-12w group detected 94 (86 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated), 36 (13 up-regulated and 23 down-regulated) and 86 (24 up-regulated and 62 down-regulated) DEMs, respectively. Seven key metabolites of sustained changes in the supraspinatus tendon following induction of diabetes include D-Lactic acid, xanthine, O-acetyl-L-carnitine, isoleucylproline, propoxycarbazone, uric acid, and cytidine, which are the first identified biomarkers of the supraspinatus tendon as it progresses through the course of diabetes. The results of KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the main pathway of supraspinatus metabolism affected by diabetes (p < 0.05) was purine metabolism. The results of the KEGG metabolic pathway vs. DEMs correlation network graph revealed that uric acid and xanthine play a role in more metabolic pathways.Conclusion Untargeted metabolomics revealed the dynamic changes of metabolite composition in rat supraspinatus tendons at different stages of diabetes, and the newly discovered seven metabolites, especially uric acid and xanthine, may provide novel research to elucidate the mechanism of diabetes-induced tendinopathy.";;"Qingdao University; Qingdao Municipal Hospital";;;;;;;;;;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;NOV 20;2023;14;;;;;;;;1292103;10.3389/fendo.2023.1292103;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2023.1292103;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001113384600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Many AGEs are long lived. Recent findings suggest that AGEs may predict diabetes and its complications and thus may warrant further study. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of our experimental procedures for measuring AGEs in stored blood sample and to conduct a pilot study for developing AGE biomarkers for diabetes and/or age-related changes of glucose metabolism. We conducted a reliability study of the samples and methods using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS assays for 10 AGEs (including methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone (MG-H1), glucosepane (GSP) and two oxidation measures, in stored repository blood samples from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We also analyzed data relating blood GSP levels to type 2 diabetes status in a case-control study (25 cases and 15 controls). Among the AGEs, GSP, and MG-H1 showed the highest reliability across the various measures: reliability in duplicate samples and stability with delayed processing and storage over 1-2 year period. Furthermore, plasma GSP was associated with older age (P=0.04) and type 2 diabetes status (age-adjusted P=0.0475). Our findings suggest that analysis of these AGEs may be developed as biomarkers for diabetes and/or age-related changes of glucose metabolism.

Diabetic nephropathy is also associated with an increased risk of vascular disease and patient mortality. Aggressive management of hypertension to reduce microalbuminuria, together with tight glycaemic control are important therapeutic strategies for renal and vascular disease prevention in T2D. The main pathophysiological mechanisms associated with diabetic nephropathy result from activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), protein kinase C pathway, pro-inflammatory cytokines and various growth factors. Angiotensin II and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) are two important molecular mediators. The production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and increased oxidative stress further exacerbates renal injury. These molecular changes within the renal tissue result in mesangial expansion, increased extracellular matrix deposition and an alteration in podocyte structure and function. Therapeutic targeting of these molecular pathways is an important area of translational research in diabetes. The elucidation of new genetic associations and proteomic biomarkers of diabetic kidney disease will also assist in the identification and treatment of high-risk patients. This review article will discuss both the molecular and clinical aspects of diabetic nephropathy, providing a bench-to-bedside research perspective to potential new therapeutic strategies.;;"University of Strathclyde; University of Glasgow";;;;;;;;;;45;49;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2009;16;8;;;;;997;1016;;10.2174/092986709787581897;http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/092986709787581897;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000265691700007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: Animals were divided into the 5 groups of control (Con), diabetes (Dia), diabeticcrocin (Dia-Cro), diabetic-voluntary exercise (Dia-Exe), and diabetic-crocin-voluntary exercise (Dia-Cro-Exe). Type 2 diabetes was induced by the use of a high-fat diet (4 weeks) and injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (i.p, 35 mg/kg). Animals received crocin orally (50 mg/kg), and voluntary exercise was performed alone or together for 8 weeks. QRT-PCR method was used to determine the levels of miR-210 and miR-126 in cardiac tissue. Results: The levels of miR-210 and miR-126 in the cardiac tissue augmented in both the crocin and voluntary exercise groups in comparison with the non-treated group (p<0.001). The use of combination therapy with exercise and crocin magnified their effects on miR-210 and miR-126 levels (p<0.001). Moreover, MiR-210 levels were lower in the crocin group compared to the exercise group (p<0.001). Conclusion: The results indicated that voluntary exercise combined with crocin might provide a novel therapeutic plan for cardiovascular disease through increasing miR-210 and miR-126 expression.;;"Lorestan University of Medical Sciences; Lorestan University of Medical Sciences; Urmia University of Medical Sciences; Urmia University of Medical Sciences";;;;;;;;;;6;6;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2020;26;4;;;;;379;385;;10.34172/PS.2020.47;http://dx.doi.org/10.34172/PS.2020.47;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000607794000005;View Full Record in Web of Science

This has prompted the search for additional biomarkers. A variety of blood biomarkers representing various pathophysiological pathways of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, as well as markers of subclinical disease and genetic markers, have been investigated. This review provides an overview of studies assessing the clinical utility of various biomarkers on the basis of hypothesis-driven selection as well as hypothesis-free approaches from novel -omics technologies. So far, the assessment of genotypes and of several candidate biomarkers from blood has resulted in only small improvements in the accuracy of prediction of CVD and T2D over and above that predicted on the basis of established risk factors. Integrated approaches, combining biomarkers from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, as well as serial measurements of biomarkers, are required to make a complete assessment of the potential clinical usefulness of biomarkers for risk prediction of cardiometabolic disease.;;"Ulm University; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Leibniz Association; Deutsches Diabetes-Zentrum (DDZ)";;;;;;;;;;124;129;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2011;90;1;;;;;52;66;;10.1038/clpt.2011.93;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/clpt.2011.93;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000291853800015;View Full Record in Web of Science

Analytical methods based on protein precipitation or solid-phase extraction together with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were developed for the determination of 25 bile adds in plasma, urine and feces samples collected from db/db and wt mice. GLP-1 concentration and hepatic genes related to bile acid synthesis were also investigated. The results showed that the concentrations of individual bile adds varied notably both interindividually and temporally. However, plasma, urine and feces samples displayed discriminating bile acid profiles between the db/db and wt groups, with the plasma profile showing the best differentiation capacity. In plasma and urine, the concentration variation of taurine-conjugated bile adds was more correlated with that of other taurine-conjugated bile acids, and vice versa for the unconjugated bile acids. Transcription of hepatic gene Cyp7b1 was downregulated, and Hsd3b7 upregulated in db/db mice. In conclusion, the bile add profile, particularly that in plasma, can distinguish the two animal groups and is a promising biomarker for type 2 diabetes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It is therefore important to deeply characterize the human nutritional responses. Objective: Endocrine parameters and the metabolome of human plasma are rapidly responding to acute nutritional interventions such as caloric restriction or a glucose challenge. It is less well understood whether the plasma proteome would be equally dynamic, and whether it could be a source of corresponding biomarkers. Methods: We used high-throughput mass spectrometry to determine changes in the plasma proteome of i) 10 healthy, young, male individuals in response to 2 days of acute caloric restriction followed by refeeding; ii) 200 individuals of the Ely epidemiological study before and after a glucose tolerance test at 4 time points (0, 30, 60, 120 minutes); and iii) 200 random individuals from the Generation Scotland study. We compared the proteomic changes detected with metabolome data and endocrine parameters. Results: Both caloric restriction and the glucose challenge substantially impacted the plasma proteome. Proteins responded across individuals or in an individual-specific manner. We identified nutrient-responsive plasma proteins that correlate with changes in the metabolome, as well as with endocrine parameters. In particular, our study highlights the role of apolipoprotein C1 (APOC1), a small, understudied apolipoprotein that was affected by caloric restriction and dominated the response to glucose consumption and differed in abundance between individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. Conclusion: Our study identifies APOC1 as a dominant nutritional responder in humans and highlights the interdependency of acute nutritional response proteins and the endocrine system.";;"Francis Crick Institute; Berlin Institute of Health; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; University of Cambridge; Berlin Institute of Health; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Addenbrooke's Hospital; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge; Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Addenbrooke's Hospital; University of Geneva; University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; Berlin Institute of Health; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Chalmers University of Technology; Vilnius University; University of London; King's College London; University of London; Queen Mary University London";;;;;;;;;;5;5;;;;;;;;;;;JUL 14;2023;108;8;;;;;2087;2098;;10.1210/clinem/dgad031;http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgad031;;JAN 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000942761900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Few studies, however, explored the association using objective biomarkers (particular for daidzein metabolite-equol) of isoflavones. We aimed to explore the association of urinary equol, daidzein and genistein concentrations with T2D and examine the mediating roles of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4). Methods This prospective study included 2818 subjects. Urinary concentrations of equol, daidzein and genistein were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The associations between urinary isoflavones and T2D incidence were evaluated by cox proportional hazards model. Results After adjustment for covariates, urinary equol except daidzein and genistein was inversely associated with T2D incidence. In comparison with the first tertile, multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for T2D incidence in the second and third tertile of equol concentration were 0.52 (0.37, 0.73) and 0.72 (0.53, 0.97), respectively. In stratified analyses by sex, the HR (95% CI) of men in the second vs. first tertile of equol was 0.29 (0.14, 0.58). Equivalent estimation in women was 0.67 (0.45, 1.01). Neither women nor men in the third tertile showed significant difference of T2D incidence compared with the first tertile. In path analyses, there was no evidence of mediating effects of hsCRP and RBP4 on the equol-T2D relationship. Conclusions Urinary equol was favorably associated with a decreased T2D incidence in Chinese adults. The equol-T2D relationship might not be mediated by hsCRP and RBP4.;;"Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Southern Medical University - China";;;;;;;;;;16;17;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2020;59;2;;;;;719;728;;10.1007/s00394-019-01939-0;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-019-01939-0;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000518487600024;View Full Record in Web of Science

Adipocytes, besides being a major site for energy storage, are endocrine in nature and secrete a variety of proteins, adipocytokines (adipokines), that can modulate insulin sensitivity, inflammation, obesity, hypertension, food intake (anorexigenic and orexigenic), and general energy homeostasis. Recent data demonstrates that increased intracellular glycosylation of proteins via O-GlcNAc can induce insulin resistance and that a rodent model with genetically elevated O-GlcNAc levels in muscle and fat displays hyperleptinemia. The link between O-GlcNAc levels, insulin resistance, and adipocytokine secretion is further explored here. First, with the use of immortalized and primary rodent adipocytes, the secreted proteome of differentiated adipocytes is more fully elucidated by the identification of 97 and 203 secreted proteins, respectively. Mapping of more than 80 Winked glycosylation sites on adipocytokines from the cell lines further defines this proteome. Importantly, adipocytokines that are modulated when cells are shifted from insulin responsive to insulin resistant conditions are determined. By the use of two protocols for inducing insulin resistance, classical hyperglycemia with chronic insulin exposure and pharmacological elevation of O-GlcNAc levels, several proteins are identified that are regulated in a similar fashion under both conditions including HCNP, Quiescin Q6, Angiotensin, lipoprotein lipase, matrix metalloproteinase 2, and slit homologue 3. Detection of these potential prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers for metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes, and the resulting complications of both diseases further establishes the central role of the O-GlcNAc modification of intracellular proteins in the pathophysiology of these conditions.;;"University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of California System; University of California Davis";;;;;;;;;;43;54;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2008;7;3;;;;;1251;1263;;10.1021/pr7006945;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr7006945;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000253825100039;View Full Record in Web of Science

We prospectively investigated the association between serum metabolites measured by targeted metabolomics and risk of T2D in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam (27,548 adults) among all incident cases of T2D (n = 800, mean follow-up 7 years) and a randomly drawn subcohort (n = 2,282). Flow injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify 163 metabolites, including acylcarnitines, amino acids, hexose, and phospholipids, in baseline serum samples. Serum hexose; phenylalanine; and diacyl-phosphatidylcholines C32:1, C36:1, C38:3, and C40:5 were independently associated with increased risk of T2D and serum glycine; sphingomyelin C16:1; acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines C34:3, C40:6, C42:5, C44:4, and C44:5; and lysophosphatidylcholine C18:2 with decreased risk. Variance of the metabolites was largely explained by two metabolite factors with opposing risk associations (factor 1 relative risk in extreme quintiles 0.31 [95% CI 0.21-0.44], factor 2 3.82 [2.64-5.52]). The metabolites significantly improved T2D prediction compared with established risk factors. They were further linked to insulin sensitivity and secretion in the Tubingen Family study and were partly replicated in the independent KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) cohort. The data indicate that metabolic alterations, including sugar metabolites, amino acids, and choline-containing phospholipids, are associated early on with a higher risk of T2D.

These metabolites were mainly associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway, the ovarian steroidogenesis pathway, and the platelet activation pathway. Our study revealed that a high-fat diet causes significant lipometabolic disorders; these metabolites may inhibit oxygen respiration by increasing adipocytes cells and density, cause mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, produce inflammation, and finally lead to insulin resistance, thereby increasing the risk of Type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and other metabolic syndromes. A high-fat diet (HFD) is widely recognized as a significant modifiable risk for insulin resistance, inflammation, Type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and other metabolic diseases. However, the biological mechanism responsible for key metabolic disorders in the PAT of rabbits subject to HFD remains unclear. Here, untargeted metabolomics (LC-MS/MS) combined with liquid chromatography (LC) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) were used to evaluate PAT metabolic changes. Histological observations showed that the adipocytes cells and density of PAT were significantly increased in HFD rabbits.

However, the cost and complexity of the methodology and interpretation of findings have limited the transference of knowledge to clinical practice. Here, we apply a targeted metabolomics approach using samples blotted in filter paper to develop clinical-metabolomics models to detect kidney dysfunction in diabetic kidney disease (DKD).MethodsWe included healthy controls and subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with and without DKD and investigated the association between metabolite concentrations in blood and urine with eGFR and albuminuria. We also evaluated performance of clinical, biochemical and metabolomic models to improve kidney dysfunction prediction in DKD.ResultsUsing clinical-metabolomics models, we identified associations of decreased eGFR with body mass index (BMI), uric acid and C10:2 levels; albuminuria was associated to years of T2D duration, A1C, uric acid, creatinine, protein intake and serum C0, C10:2 and urinary C12:1 levels. DKD was associated with age, A1C, uric acid, BMI, serum C0, C10:2, C8:1 and urinary C12:1.

Our recent transcriptomic profiling of glomerular endothelial cells identified a number of proangiogenic genes that were upregulated in diabetic mice, including leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1). LRG1 was previously shown to promote neovascularization in mouse models of ocular disease by potentiating endothelial TGF-beta/activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) signaling. However, LRG1's role in the kidney, particularly in the setting of DKD, has been unclear. Methods We analyzed expression of LRG1 mRNA in glomeruli of diabetic kidneys and assessed its localization by RNA in situ hybridization. We examined the effects of genetic ablation of Lrg1 on DKD progression in unilaterally nephrectomized, streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice at 12 and 20 weeks after diabetes induction. We also assessed whether plasma LRG1 was associated with renal outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes. Results LRG1 localized predominantly to glomerular endothelial cells, and its expression was elevated in the diabetic kidneys. LRG1 ablation markedly attenuated diabetes-induced glomerular angiogenesis, podocyte loss, and the development of diabetic glomerulopathy. These improvements were associated with reduced ALK1-Smad1/5/8 activation in glomeruli of diabetic mice. Moreover, increased plasma LRG1 was associated with worse renal outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes. Conclusions These findings identify LRG1 as a potential novel pathogenic mediator of diabetic glomerular neoangiogenesis and a risk factor in DKD progression.;;"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital; Xiamen University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Columbia University; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); James J.

We established the differential proteomic signatures of WAT in glucose-tolerant lean and obese individuals and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the response to 8 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Using a high-throughput and reproducible mass spectrometry-based proteomics pipeline, we identified 3773 proteins and found that most regulated proteins displayed progression in markers of dysfunctional WAT from lean to obese to T2D individuals and were highly associated with clinical measures such as insulin sensitivity and HbA1c. We propose that these distinct markers could serve as potential clinical biomarkers. HIIT induced only minor changes in the WAT proteome. This included an increase in WAT ferritin levels independent of obesity and T2D, and WAT ferritin levels were strongly correlated with individual insulin sensitivity. Together, we report a proteomic signature of WAT related to obesity and T2D and highlight an unrecognized role of human WAT iron metabolism in exercise training adaptations.;;"University of Copenhagen; University of Southern Denmark; Odense University Hospital; University of Southern Denmark; University of Southern Denmark";;;;;;;;;;6;6;;;;;;;;;;;DEC 1;2023;9;48;;;;;;;eadi7548;10.1126/sciadv.adi7548;http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adi7548;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001122844300008;View Full Record in Web of Science

In a discovery phase, we investigated associations between 88 plasma proteins, assessed with a proximity extension assay, and plasma leptin in a cohort of middle-aged patients with T2DM. Associations passing the significance threshold of a False discovery rate of 5% (corresponding to p<0.0017) were replicated in patients with T2DM in an independent cohort. We also investigated if proteins mediated the longitudinal association between plasma leptin and the incidence of major cardiovascular events (MACE). One protein, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP), was significantly associated with leptin in both the discovery phase [95% CI (0.06, 0.17) p=0.00002] and the replication cohort [95% CI (0.12, 0.39) p=0.0003]. Multiplicative interaction analyses in the two cohorts suggest a stronger association between A-FABP and leptin in men than in women. In longitudinal analyses, the association between leptin and MACE was slightly attenuated after adding A-FABP to the multivariate model. Our analysis identified a consistent association between leptin and A-FABP in two independent cohorts of patients with T2DM, particularly in men.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT 01049737.;;"Linkoping University; Karolinska Institutet; Dalarna University; Uppsala University; Umea University";;;;;;;;;;7;7;;;;;;;;;;;AUG 4;2020;10;1;;;;;;;13097;10.1038/s41598-020-69473-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69473-2;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000561100900028;View Full Record in Web of Science

We used a novel high-throughput 92-protein assay to identify circulating biomarkers for HOMA of IR in two cohorts of community residents without diabetes (n = 1,367) (mean age 73 +/- 3.6 years). Adjusted linear regression identified cathepsin D and confirmed six proteins (leptin, renin, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1ra], hepatocyte growth factor, fatty acid-binding protein 4, and tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA]) as IR biomarkers. Mendelian randomization analysis indicated a positive causal effect of IR on t-PA concentrations. Two biomarkers, IL-1ra (hazard ratio [HR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59) and t-PA (HR 1.30, 1.02-1.65) were associated with incident T2D, and t-PA predicted 5-year transition to hyperglycemia (odds ratio 1.30, 95% CI 1.02-1.65). Additional adjustment for fasting glucose rendered both coefficients insignificant and revealed an association between renin and T2D (HR 0.79, 0.62-0.99). LASSO regression suggested a risk model including IL-1ra, t-PA, and the Framingham Offspring Study T2D score, but prediction improvement was nonsignificant (difference in C-index 0.02, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.12) over the T2D score only.

This study aimed to investigate the association of plasma proteins with all-cause and cause-specific mortality among individuals with and without baseline type 2 diabetes (T2D) and evaluate their impact on the prediction of all-cause mortality in two prospective Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) studies.MethodsThe discovery cohort comprised 1545 participants (median follow-up 15.6 years; 244 with T2D: 116 total, 62 cardiovascular, 31 cancer-related and 23 other-cause deaths; 1301 without T2D: 321 total, 114 cardiovascular, 120 cancer-related and 87 other-cause deaths). The validation cohort comprised 1031 participants (median follow-up 6.9 years; 203 with T2D: 76 total, 45 cardiovascular, 19 cancer-related and 12 other-cause deaths; 828 without T2D: 169 total, 74 cardiovascular, 39 cancer-related and 56 other-cause deaths). We used Cox regression to examine associations of 233 plasma proteins with all-cause and cause-specific mortality and Lasso regression to construct prediction models for all-cause mortality stratifying by baseline T2D. C-index, category-free net reclassification index (cfNRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were conducted to evaluate the predictive performance of built prediction models.ResultsThirty-five and 62 proteins, with 29 overlapping, were positively associated with all-cause mortality in the group with and without T2D, respectively. Out of these, in the group with T2D, 35, eight, and 26 were positively associated with cardiovascular, cancer-related, and other-cause mortality, while in the group without T2D, 55, 41, and 47 were positively associated with respective cause-specific outcomes in the pooled analysis of both cohorts. Regulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) transport and uptake by IGF-binding proteins emerged as a unique pathway enriched for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with T2D.

We aimed to separate diabetes-associated from obesity-associated metabolite alterations in plasma and study the impact of metabolically important tissues on plasma metabolite concentrations. Methods Two obese mouse models were studied; one exclusively with obesity (ob/ob) and another with type 2 diabetes (db/db). Both models have impaired leptin signalling as a cause for obesity, but the different genetic backgrounds determine the susceptibility to diabetes. In these mice, we profiled plasma, liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue via semi-quantitative GC-MS and quantitative liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS for a wide range of metabolites. Results Metabolite profiling identified 24 metabolites specifically associated with diabetes but not with obesity. Among these are known markers such as 1,5-anhydro-d-sorbitol, 3-hydroxybutyrate and the recently reported marker glyoxylate. New metabolites in the diabetic model were lysine, O-phosphotyrosine and branched-chain fatty acids. We also identified 33 metabolites that were similarly altered in both models, represented by branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) as well as glycine, serine, trans-4-hydroxyproline, and various lipid species and derivatives. Correlation analyses showed stronger associations for plasma amino acids with adipose tissue metabolites in db/db mice compared with ob/ob mice, suggesting a prominent contribution of adipose tissue to changes in plasma in a diabetic state.

Whether it is also a determinant of mortality and cardiovascular disease in patients with microalbuminuria (MA) is unknown. Methods: Urine samples were obtained from 155 patients with type 2 diabetes and confirmed microalbuminuria. Proteomic analysis was undertaken using capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry to determine the CKD273 classifier score. A previously defined CKD273 threshold of 0.343 for identification of DN was used to categorise the cohort in Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models with all-cause mortality as the primary endpoint. Outcomes were traced through national health registers after 6 years. Results: CKD273 correlated with urine albumin excretion rate (UAER) (r = 0.481, p = <0.001), age (r = 0.238, p = 0.003), coronary artery calcium (CAC) score (r = 0.236, p = 0.003), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (r = 0.190, p = 0.018) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (r = 0.265, p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis only UAER (beta = 0.402, p < 0.001) and eGFR (beta = -0.184, p = 0.039) were statistically significant determinants of CKD273. Twenty participants died during follow-up. CKD273 was a determinant of mortality (log rank [ Mantel-Cox] p = 0.004), and retained significance (p = 0.048) after adjustment for age, sex, blood pressure, NT-proBNP and CAC score in a Cox regression model. Conclusion: A multidimensional biomarker can provide information on outcomes associated with its primary diagnostic purpose.

Lipidomics presents a new set of tools to unravel the relationship between hyper-caloric diets and other environmental and genetic factors with the metabolic syndrome and disease progression. Recent findings Plasma lipidomic studies are providing detailed characterisation of the dyslipidaemia associated with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Combined with lipoprotein fractionation and dynamic modelling we are gaining a new comprehension of lipoprotein composition structure and function. At the population level genome-wide association studies are identifying potential loci linking lipid metabolism with disease pathogenesis. Analysis of tissue, cell and even organelle lipidomes are unravelling the complex relationships between lipotoxicity, inflammation, oxidative stress and cellular function. Summary The global view of lipid metabolism offered by lipidomics is accelerating our understanding of disease processes and identifying new avenues of research into metabolic syndrome and its sequelae. The ongoing identification and validation of lipid biomarkers will likely see their introduction into clinical practice for improved quantification of disease risk, earlier identification of disease and improved patient management in the near future.;;"Monash University; Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute; Monash University";;;;;;;;;;85;89;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2011;22;3;;;;;210;215;;10.1097/MOL.0b013e3283453dbe;http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MOL.0b013e3283453dbe;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000290514700010;View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, we aimed to identify a metabolite signature of legume consumption, and subsequently investigate its potential association with the incidence of T2D and CVD.MethodsThe current cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis was conducted in 1833 PREDIMED study participants (mean age 67 years, 57.6% women) with available baseline metabolomic data. A subset of these participants with 1-year follow-up metabolomics data (n = 1522) was used for internal validation. Plasma metabolites were assessed through liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Cross-sectional associations between 382 different known metabolites and legume consumption were performed using elastic net regression. Associations between the identified metabolite profile and incident T2D and CVD were estimated using multivariable Cox regression models.ResultsSpecific metabolic signatures of legume consumption were identified, these included amino acids, cortisol, and various classes of lipid metabolites including diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, plasmalogens, sphingomyelins and other metabolites. Among these identified metabolites, 22 were negatively and 18 were positively associated with legume consumption. After adjustment for recognized risk factors and legume consumption, the identified legume metabolite profile was inversely associated with T2D incidence (hazard ratio (HR) per 1 SD: 0.75, 95% CI 0.61-0.94; p = 0.017), but not with CVD incidence risk (1.01, 95% CI 0.86-1.19; p = 0.817) over the follow-up period.ConclusionsThis study identified a set of 40 metabolites associated with legume consumption and with a reduced risk of T2D development in a Mediterranean population at high risk of cardiovascular disease.Trial registration: ISRCTN35739639.ConclusionsThis study identified a set of 40 metabolites associated with legume consumption and with a reduced risk of T2D development in a Mediterranean population at high risk of cardiovascular disease.Trial registration: ISRCTN35739639.";;"Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Institut d'Investigacio Sanitaria Pere Virgili (IISPV); CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBEROBN; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; University of Navarra; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Acute admission hyperglycemia (AH) is a transient glucose alteration in response to stress. As glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reflects the glycemia over a longer period of time, its use may be helpful in distinguishing between the AH and hyperglycemia associated with T2D in the AMI setting. The aim was to assess the correlation of ceramides with both AH (defined as an admission glucose level >= 140 mg/dL in the absence of T2D) and HbA1c-T2D and other demographic, clinical, and inflammatory-related biomarkers in AMI. High-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify nine ceramide species, and their three ratios, in 140 AMI patients (FTGM coronary unit, Massa, Italy). The ceramides did not correlate with stress hyperglycemia, but specific species were elevated in T2D-AMI. Moreover, some ceramides were associated with other cardiometabolic risk factors. Ceramides assessment may be helpful in better understanding the pathogenic molecular mechanisms underlying myocardial acute events and cardiometabolic risk, as a basis for the future evaluation of their role as prognostic predictors and therapeutic targets in T2D-AMI patients.;;"Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica (IFC-CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Isituto di Chimica dei Composti Organometallici (ICCOM-CNR)";;;;;;;;;;6;7;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2023;28;2;;;;;;;716;10.3390/molecules28020716;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules28020716;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000916358800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Although it is present in foods and from the environment, endogenous formation of glyoxal occurs through metabolism of carbohydrates and oxidation of lipids and nucleic acids. Plasma concentrations of glyoxal are elevated in in diabetes mellitus patients compared to nondiabetics. The most abundant 2'-deoxyribonucleoside adducts cross-linked by glyoxal are dG-gx-dC, dG-gx-dA, and dG-gx-dG. These DNA cross links can be mutagenic by damaging the integrity of the DNA structure. Herein, we developed a highly sensitive and specific assay for the simultaneous detection and quantification of the dG-gx-dC and dG-gx-dA cross-links based on stable isotope dilution (SID) nanoflow liquid chromatography nanospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS) under the highly selected reaction monitoring mode and using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The entire assay procedure involved addition of the stable isotope standards [N-15(15)]dG-gx-dC and [N-15(5)]dG-gx-dA as internal standards, enzyme hydrolysis to release the cross-links as nucleosides, enrichment by a reversed-phase solid-phase extraction column, and nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS analysis. The detection limit is 0.19 amol for dG-gx-dC and 0.89 amol for dG-gx-dA, which is 400 and 80 times more sensitive, respectively, than capillary LC-NSI/MS/MS assay of these adducts. The lower limit of quantification was 94 and 90 amol for dG-gx-dC and dG-gx-dA, respectively, which is equivalent to 0.056 and 0.065 adducts in 10(8) normal nucleotides in 50 mu g of DNA. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients (n = 38), the levels of dG-gx-dC and dG-gx-dA in leukocyte DNA were 1.94 +/- 1.20 and 2.10 +/- 1.77 in 10(8) normal nucleotides, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in nondiabetics (n = 39: 0.83 +/- 0.92 and 1.05 +/- 0.99 in 10(8) normal nucleotides, respectively). Excluding the factor:of smoking, an exogenous source of glyoxal, levels of these two cross-linked adducts were found to be significantly higher in nonsmoking T2DM patients than in nonsmoking control subjects. Furthermore, the levels of dG-gx-dC and dG-gx-dA correlated with HbAlc with statistical significance. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of the identification and quantification of glyoxal-derived cross-linked DNA adducts in human leukocyte DNA and their association with T2DM. This SID nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS assay is highly sensitive and specific and it requires only 50,mu g of leukocyte DNA isolated from 2-3 mL of blood to accurately quantify these two cross-linked adducts simultaneously. Our assay thus provides a useful biomarker for the evaluation of glyoxal-derived DNA damage.;;National Chung Cheng University;;;;;;;;;;16;16;;;;;;;;;;;DEC 19;2017;89;24;;;;;13082;13088;;10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04296;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04296;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000418626300009;View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we hypothesised that smaller (n5), platform-specific combinations of biomarkers selected from these larger panels might achieve similar prediction performance when tested in three additional type 2 diabetes cohorts.MethodsWe used 657 serum samples, held under differing storage conditions, from the Scania Diabetes Registry (SDR) and Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research Tayside (GoDARTS), and a further 183 nested case-control sample set from the Collaborative Atorvastatin in Diabetes Study (CARDS). We analysed 42 biomarkers measured on the SDR and GoDARTS samples by a variety of methods including standard ELISA, multiplexed ELISA (Luminex) and mass spectrometry. The subset of 21 Luminex biomarkers was also measured on the CARDS samples. We used the event definition of loss of >20% of baseline eGFR during follow-up from a baseline eGFR of 30-75mlmin(-1) [1.73m](-2). A total of 403 individuals experienced an event during a median follow-up of 7years. We used discrete-time logistic regression models with tenfold cross-validation to assess association of biomarker panels with loss of kidney function.ResultsTwelve biomarkers showed significant association with eGFR decline adjusted for covariates in one or more of the sample sets when evaluated singly. Kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) and (2)-microglobulin (B2M) showed the most consistent effects, with standardised odds ratios for progression of at least 1.4 (p<0.0003) in all cohorts. A combination of B2M and KIM-1 added to clinical covariates, including baseline eGFR and albuminuria, modestly improved prediction, increasing the area under the curve in the SDR, Go-DARTS and CARDS by 0.079, 0.073 and 0.239, respectively. Neither the inclusion of additional Luminex biomarkers on top of B2M and KIM-1 nor a sparse mass spectrometry panel, nor the larger multiplatform panels previously identified, consistently improved prediction further across all validation sets.Conclusions/interpretationSerum KIM-1 and B2M independently improve prediction of renal decline from an eGFR of 30-75mlmin(-1) [1.73m](-2) in type 2 diabetes beyond clinical factors and prior eGFR and are robust to varying sample storage conditions.

Objective: In this study, we explore plasma miRNA profiles in patients with DM. Methods and Results: Total RNA was extracted from plasma samples of the prospective population-based Bruneck study. A total of 13 candidate miRNAs identified by microarray screening and miRNA network inference were quantified by quantitative PCR in all diabetic patients of the Bruneck study and age-and sex-matched controls (1995 evaluation, n=80 each). Quantitative PCR assessment revealed lower plasma levels of miR-20b, miR-21, miR-24, miR-15a, miR-126, miR-191, miR-197, miR-223, miR-320, and miR-486 in prevalent DM, but a modest increase of miR-28-3p. Findings emerged as robust in multivariable analysis and were independent of the standardization procedure applied. For endothelial miR-126, results were confirmed in the entire Bruneck cohort (n=822) in univariate (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.38 [0.26 to 0.55]; P=2.72x10(-7)) and multivariate analyses (0.57 [0.37 to 0.86]; P=0.0082). Importantly, reduced miR-15a, miR-29b, miR-126, miR-223, and elevated miR-28-3p levels antedated the manifestation of disease. Most differences in miRNA levels were replicated in plasma obtained from hyperglycemic Lep(ob) mice. High glucose concentrations reduced the miR-126 content of endothelial apoptotic bodies. Similarly in patients with DM, the reduction of miR-126 was confined to circulating vesicles in plasma. Conclusions: We reveal a plasma miRNA signature for DM that includes loss of endothelial miR-126. These findings might explain the impaired peripheral angiogenic signaling in patients with DM.

This study aims to predict the structural stability, and functional impacts on variations in non- synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in the human SLC30A8 gene using various computational techniques. Materials and methods: Several in silico tools, including SIFT, Predict-SNP, SNPs&GO, &GO, MAPP, SNAP2, PhD-SNP, PANTHER, PolyPhen-1,PolyPhen-2, I-Mutant 2.0, and MUpro, have been used in our study. Results: After data analysis, out of 336 missenses, the eight nsSNPs, namely R138Q, I141N, W136G, I349N, L303R, E140A, W306C, and L308Q, were discovered by ConSurf to be in highly conserved regions, which could affect the stability of their proteins. Project HOPE determines any significant molecular effects on the structure and function of eight mutated proteins and the three-dimensional (3D) structures of these proteins. The two pharmacologically significant compounds, Luzonoid B and Roseoside demonstrate strong binding affinity to the mutant proteins, and they are more efficient in inhibiting them than the typical SLC30A8 protein using Autodock Vina and Chimera. Increased binding affinity to mutant SLC30A8 proteins has been determined not to influence drug resistance. Ultimately, the Kaplan-Meier plotter study revealed that alterations in SLC30A8 gene expression notably affect the survival rates of patients with various cancer types. Conclusion: Finally, the study found eight highly deleterious missense nsSNPs in the SLC30A8 gene that can be helpful for further proteomic and genomic studies for T2D and colorectal cancer diagnosis.

Xanthohumol, a prenylated flavonoid from hops (Humulus lupulus), was tested for efficacy on biomarkers of metabolic syndrome in 4 week old Zucker fa/fa rats, a rodent model of obesity. Rats received daily oral doses of xanthohumol at 0, 1.86, 5.64, and 16.9 mg/kg BW for 6 weeks. All rats were maintained on a high fat (60% kcal) AIN-93G diet for 3 weeks to induce severe obesity followed by a normal AIN-93G (15% kcal fat) diet for the last 3 weeks of the study. Weekly food intake and body weight were recorded. Plasma cholesterol, glucose, insulin, triglyceride, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels were assessed using commercial assay kits. Plasma and liver tissue levels of XN and its metabolites were determined by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma and liver tissue levels of xanthohumol were similar between low and medium dose groups and significantly (p < 0.05) elevated in the highest dose group. There was a dose-dependent effect on body weight and plasma glucose levels. The highest dose group (n = 6) had significantly lower plasma glucose levels compared to the control group (n = 6) in male but not female rats. There was also a significant decrease in body weight for male rats in the highest dose group (16.9 mg/kg BW) compared to rats that received no xanthohumol, which was also not seen for female rats. Plasma cholesterol, insulin, triglycerides, and MCP-1 as well as food intake were not affected by treatment. The findings suggest that xanthohumol has beneficial effects on markers of metabolic syndrome.

Methods Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics was used in a nested casecontrol study based on a screening sample of 64-year-old Caucasian women (n = 629). Candidate metabolic markers of T2D were identified in plasma obtained at baseline and the power to predict diabetes was tested in 69 incident cases occurring during 5.5 years followup. The metabolomics results were used as a standalone prediction model and in combination with established T2D predictive biomarkers for building eight T2D prediction models that were compared with each other based on their sensitivity and selectivity for predicting T2D. Results Established markers of T2D (impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance (HOMA), smoking, serum adiponectin)) alone, and in combination with metabolomics had the largest areas under the curve (AUC) (0.794 (95% confidence interval [0.738-0.850]) and 0.808 [0.749-0.867] respectively), with the standalone metabolomics model based on nine fasting plasma markers having a lower predictive power (0.657 [0.577-0.736]). Prediction based on non-blood based measures was 0.638 [0.565-0.711]). Conclusions Established measures of T2D risk remain the best predictor of T2D risk in this population.

The untreated GDM affects both the baby and mother during gestation as well as presents the risk of subsequent type 2 diabetes in mothers and babies. Objective: To determine the effect of GDM on plasma proteomics as variable plasma proteins can be secreted by the cells at the pathological sites and can serve as a biomarker of the disease. Methods: Blood samples were taken from 400 pregnant women at early second trimester and they were followed till early third trimester or until the development of GDM. All the pregnant females were sampled again in 3rd trimester. Overall 42 pregnant females developed GDM. These females were grouped as GDM I and GDM II, before and after the development of gestational diabetes, respectively. An equivalent number of pregnant women who did not develop GDM served as control I and control II in early second and third trimester, respectively. Blood samples from all the groups were subjected to 2D gel electrophoresis. Results: Nineteen protein spots were differently expressed between GDM and control groups, two spots were further confirmed by LC-MS/MS as Retinol binding protein A4 and Transthyretin. These two proteins were found to be up regulated in GDM group in early second trimester as well as early 3rd trimester. Conclusion: Transthyretin and Retinol binding protein 4 can be used as predictive plasma biomarkers of GDM that might help in the identification of at-risk pregnancies, hence, providing the best opportunity for early treatment in order to prevent the onset or progression of the disease.;;"University of Punjab; University of Lahore";;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;;2020;17;3;;;;;180;190;;10.2174/1570164617666190822125837;http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1570164617666190822125837;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000521752800002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Because skeletal muscle has been shown to secrete proteins that could be used as biomarkers, we characterized the secreted protein profile of muscle cells derived from extremely obese (BMI 48.8 +/- 14.8 kg/m(2); homeostasis model assessment [HOMA] 3.6 +/- 1.0) relative to lean healthy subjects (BMI 25.7 +/- 3.2 kg/m(2); HOMA 0.8 +/- 0.2). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We hypothesized that skeletal muscle would secrete proteins that predict the severity of obesity. To test this hypothesis, we used a bottom-up experimental design using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in culture (SILAC) and liquid chromatography/mass spectometry/ mass spectometry (LC-MS/MS) to both identify and quantify proteins secreted from cultured myotubes derived from extremely obese compared with healthy nonobese women. RESULTS-Using SILAC, we discovered a 2.9-fold increase in the secretion of myostatin from extremely obese human myotubes. The increased secretion and biological activity of myostatin were validated by immunoblot (3.16 +/- 0.18, P < 0.01) and a myoblast proliferation assay using conditioned growth medium. Myostatin was subsequently shown to increase in skeletal muscle (23%, P < 0.05) and plasma (35%, P < 0.05) and to correlate (r(2) = 0.6, P < 0.05) with the severity of insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS-Myostatin is a potent antianabolic regulator of muscle mass that may also play a role in energy metabolism. These findings show that increased expression of myostatin in skeletal muscle with obesity and insulin resistance results in elevated circulating myostatin. This may contribute to systemic metabolic deterioration of skeletal muscle with the progression of insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes.

Plasma and urinary levels of D-lactate have been linked to the presence of diabetes. Previously developed techniques have shown several limitations to further evaluate D-lactate as a biomarker for this condition. Methods. D- and L-lactate were quantified using ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with labelled internal standard. Samples were derivatized with diacetyl-L-tartaric anhydride and separated on a C-18-reversed phase column. D- and L-lactate were analysed in plasma and urine of controls, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Results. Quantitative analysis of D- and L-lactate was achieved successfully. Calibration curves were linear (r(2) > 0.99) over the physiological and pathophysiological ranges. Recoveries for urine and plasma were between 96% and 113%. Inter- and intra-assay variations were between 2% and 9%. The limits of detection of D-lactate and L-lactate in plasma were 0.7 mu mol/L and 0.2 mu mol/L, respectively. The limits of detection of D-lactate and L-lactate in urine were 8.1 nmol/mmol creatinine and 4.4 nmol/mmol creatinine, respectively. Plasma and urinary levels of D- and L-lactate were increased in patients with IBD and T2DM as compared with controls. Conclusion.

Acylcarnitines, fatty acid metabolites, have been associated with type 2 diabetes risk in cross-sectional studies of mostly Caucasian subjects, but prospective studies on their link to prediabetes in diverse populations are lacking. Here, we determined the association of plasma acylcarnitines with incident prediabetes in African Americans and European Americans enrolled in a prospective study. We analyzed 45 acylcarnitines in baseline plasma samples from 70 adults (35 African-American, 35 European-American) with incident prediabetes (progressors) and 70 matched controls (non-progressors) during 5.5-year (mean 2.6 years) follow-up in the Pathobiology of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort (POP-ABC) study. Incident prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance) was confirmed with OGTT. We measured acylcarnitines using tandem mass spectrometry, insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, and insulin secretion using intravenous glucose tolerance test. The results showed that progressors and non-progressors during POP-ABC study follow-up were concordant for 36 acylcarnitines and discordant for nine others. In logistic regression models, beta-hydroxy butyryl carnitine (C4-OH), 3-hydroxy-isovaleryl carnitine/malonyl carnitine (C5-OH/C3-DC), and octenoyl carnitine (C8:1) were the only significant predictors of incident prediabetes. The combined cut-off plasma levels of <0.03 micromol/L for C4-OH, <0.03 micromol/L for C5-OH/C3-DC, and >0.25 micromol/L for C8:1 acylcarnitines predicted incident prediabetes with 81.9% sensitivity and 65.2% specificity. Thus, circulating levels of one medium-chain and two short-chain acylcarnitines may be sensitive biomarkers for the risk of incident prediabetes among initially normoglycemic individuals with parental history of type 2 diabetes.;;"University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Health Science Center; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Health Science Center";;;;;;;;;;8;8;;;;;;;;;;;AUG;2021;246;15;;;;;1698;1705;1,53537E+16;10.1177/15353702211009493;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/15353702211009493;;APR 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000682601800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Human population studies of T2D development and its effects on systemic metabolism are confounded by many factors that cannot be controlled, complicating the interpretation of results and the identification of early biomarkers. Aged, sedentary, and overweight/obese non-human primates (NHPs) are one of the best animal models to mimic spontaneous T2D development in humans. We sought to identify and distinguish a set of plasma and/or fecal metabolite biomarkers, that have earlier disease onset predictability, and that could be evaluated for their predictability in subsequent T2D studies in human cohorts. In this study, a single plasma and fecal sample was collected from each animal in a colony of 57 healthy and dysmetabolic NHPs and analyzed for metabolomics and lipidomics. The samples were comprehensively analyzed using untargeted and targeted LC/MS/MS. The changes in each animal's disease phenotype were monitored using IVGTT, HbA1c, and other clinical metrics, and correlated with their metabolic profile. The plasma and fecal lipids, as well as bile acid profiles, from Healthy, Dysmetabolic (Dys), and Diabetic (Dia) animals were compared. Following univariate and multivariate analyses, including adjustments for weight, age, and sex, several plasma lipid species were identified to be significantly different between these animal groups. Medium and long-chain plasma phosphatidylcholines (PCs) ranked highest at distinguishing Healthy from Dys animals, whereas plasma triglycerides (TG) primarily distinguished Dia from Dys animals. Random Forest (RF) analysis of fecal bile acids showed a reduction in the secondary bile acid glycoconjugate, GCDCA, in diseased animals (AUC 0.76[0.64, 0.89]). Moreover, metagenomics results revealed several bacterial species, belonging to the genera Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, and Streptococcus, to be both significantly enriched in non-healthy animals and associated with secondary bile acid levels. In summary, our results highlight the detection of several elevated circulating plasma PCs and microbial species associated with fecal secondary bile acids in NHP dysmetabolic states. The lipids and metabolites we have identified may help researchers to differentiate individual NHPs more precisely between dysmetabolic and overtly diabetic states. This could help assign animals to study groups that are more likely to respond to potential therapies where a difference in efficacy might be anticipated between early vs. advanced disease.;;"Merck & Company; Merck & Company USA; Merck & Company; Merck & Company USA; Merck & Company; Merck & Company USA; Merck & Company; Merck & Company USA";;;;;;;;;;2;2;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2024;14;3;;;;;;;159;10.3390/metabo14030159;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo14030159;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001192567100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is not well known whether altered plasma AcylCN, and amino acid profiles are associated with albuminuria or diabetic nephropathy (DN) in T2D. Objective The aim of this study was to elucidate alterations in plasma levels of AcylCNs and amino acids with respect to the T2D patients with various stages of albuminuria. Methods We recruited 52 healthy subjects as control, and 156 T2D patients which were divided into 52 normoalbuminuria, 52 microalbuminuria, and 52 macroalbuminuria. Plasma 37 AcylCNs and 12 amino acids were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Results We found that T2D with normoalbuminuria and microalbuminuria had lower shot-, medium-, and long-chain AcylCNs, whereas T2D with macroalbuminuria had higher short-and medium-chain AcylCNs and lower long-chain AcylCNs than healthy subjects. Moreover, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was a negative, independent and significant predictor of albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) levels (beta = -0.376, P < 0.001), whereas plasma Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was significantly and positively associated with ACR levels (beta = 0.169, P = 0.049). Furthermore, multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis revealed that isobutyrylcarnitine (C4) was a positive, independent, and significant predictor of ACR levels with higher odds of having T2D patients with progression normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria [OR = 9.93, 95 % CI (3.51-28.05), P < 0.001].

Methods A prospective, parallel study in T2D (n = 23) and controls (n = 23). A hyperinsulinemic clamp was performed and normoglycemia induced in T2D [4.5 +/- 0.07 mmol/L (81 +/- 1.2 mg/dl)] for 1-h, following which blood glucose was decreased to <= 2.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dl). Proteomic analysis for the complement and coagulation cascades were measured using Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan. Results Thirty-four proteins were measured. At baseline, 4 of 18 were found to differ in T2D versus controls for platelet degranulation [Neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (p = 0.014), Thrombospondin-1 (p = 0.012), Platelet factor-4 (p = 0.007), and Kininogen-1 (p = 0.05)], whilst 3 of 16 proteins differed for complement and coagulation cascades [Coagulation factor IX (p < 0.05), Kininogen-1 (p = 0.05), and Heparin cofactor-2 (p = 0.007)]; STRING analysis demonstrated the close relationship of these proteins to one another. Induced euglycemia in T2D showed no protein changes versus baseline. At hypoglycemia, however, four proteins changed in controls from baseline [Thrombospondin-1 (p < 0.014), platelet factor-4 (p < 0.01), Platelet basic protein (p < 0.008), and Vitamin K-dependent protein-C (p < 0.00003)], and one protein changed in T2D [Vitamin K-dependent protein-C, (p < 0.0002)]. Conclusion Seven of 34 proteins suggested to be biomarkers of COVID-19 severity within the platelet degranulation and complement and coagulation cascades differed in T2D versus controls, with further changes occurring at hypoglycemia, suggesting that validation of these biomarkers is critical.

We studied whether a urine proteome specific for sight-threatening proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an indicator to predict chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) in patients with T2D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A shotgun urine proteomic analysis was performed in patients with MAU and PDR (case subjects) and in patients with MAU and a duration of T2D for > 10 years but without any degree of retinopathy (control subjects). In the cohort study, 210 patients with T2D with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 80 mL/min/1.73m(2) were followed for a median of 5.3 years. Urine proteins specific for PDR were used for predicting CRI (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). RESULTS The top two urine proteins with the highest difference in ratio of case subjects to control subjects were haptoglobin (8.7 times; P < 0.0001) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (5.7 times; P < 0.0001). In the cohort study, patients with baseline urinary haptoglobin >= 20 ng/min (haptoglobinuria) had a higher incidence of CRI than those without (hazard ratio [95% CI] 3.27 [1.41-7.58]; P = 0.006). The overall CRI rate was 3.2% for patients without haptoglobinuria or MAU, 9.5% for those with MAU, and 13.3% for those with haptoglobinuria. The highest rate for CRI (22.4%) was in patients with both MAU and haptoglobinuria (P < 0.001).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) was a randomized clinical trial evaluating the cardiovascular (CV) safety and efficacy of once-weekly exenatide for patients with T2D. Candidate biomarker data were selected from proteomic profiling performed at baseline and 12 months after randomization samples by SomaScan assay in 5,473 trial participants. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (major cardiovascular events [MACE]). Cox proportional hazards models controlling for confounders were used for time-to-event analyses to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CI for a 1 SD increase in the biomarker concentrations. RESULTS The primary outcome occurred in 813 participants (14.9%). Higher levels of osteoprotegerin (HR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03-1.20; P = 0.0047) and osteopontin (HR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02-1.18; P = 0.0095) were associated with an increased risk of MACE. The addition of osteoprotegerin and osteopontin to a clinical predictive model containing traditional CV risk factors provided minimal incremental value for MACE prediction (C-index 0.629 vs. 0.638; likelihood ratio test P < 0.001). Osteocalcin and sclerostin were not associated with MACE. Osteocalcin had a nonlinear association with all-cause death and with CV death.

Identifying alternative markers for early detection is imperative. In this study, we profiled the urinary proteome in patients with albuminuria and well-preserved eGFR. We identified 80 proteins that were differentially abundant between the cases (albuminuria) and controls (normoalbuminuria). Among these, 12 proteins (SERPINA1, ALB, SERPINC1, AFM, PIGR, A1BG, COL6A1, MYG, LV39, MUC1, ICOSLG, and UMOD) had the highest discriminating abilities (area under curve > 0.8) between the cases and controls. When differentially abundant proteins were combined into an 80-protein model, the model was able to predict cases from controls with a predictive accuracy of 91.3%. The top five enriched biological pathways associated with the differentially abundant proteins included insulin growth factor functions, innate immunity, platelet degranulation, and extracellular matrix organization. Albuminuria may precede decreases in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and both tests are insensitive predictors of early stages of kidney disease. Our aim was to characterise the urinary proteome in black African individuals with albuminuria and well-preserved GFR from South Africa. This case-controlled study compared the urinary proteomes of 52 normoalbuminuric (urine albumin: creatinine ratio (uACR) < 3 mg/mmol) and 56 albuminuric (uACR >= 3 mg/mmol) adults of black African ethnicity. Urine proteins were precipitated, reduced, alkylated, digested, and analysed using an Evosep One LC (Evosep Biosystems, Odense, Denmark) coupled to a Sciex 5600 Triple-TOF (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) in data-independent acquisition mode. The data were searched on Spectronaut (TM) 15. Differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were filtered to include those with a >= 2.25-fold change and a false discovery rate <= 1%. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were used to assess the discriminating abilities of proteins of interest. Pathway analysis was performed using Enrichr software. As expected, the albuminuric group had higher uACR (7.9 vs. 0.55 mg/mmol, p < 0.001). The median eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m(2)) showed no difference between the groups (111 vs. 114, p = 0.707). We identified 80 DAPs in the albuminuria group compared to the normoalbuminuria group, of which 59 proteins were increased while 21 proteins were decreased in abundance. We found 12 urinary proteins with an AUC > 0.8 and a p < 0.001 in the multivariate analysis. Furthermore, an 80-protein model was developed that showed a high AUC > 0.907 and a predictive accuracy of 91.3% between the two groups. Pathway analysis found that the DAPs were involved in insulin growth factor (IGF) functions, innate immunity, platelet degranulation, and extracellular matrix organization. In albuminuric individuals with a well-preserved eGFR, pathways involved in preventing the release and uptake of IGF by insulin growth factor binding protein were significantly enriched. These proteins are indicative of a homeostatic imbalance in a variety of cellular processes underlying renal dysfunction and are implicated in chronic kidney disease.;;"National Health Laboratory Service; University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand; Council for Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - South Africa; University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand; University of Witwatersrand";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;SEP;2024;13;9;;;;;;;680;10.3390/biology13090680;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology13090680;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001326459900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

T2D modifies the lipid composition of plasma and lipoproteins and some sphingolipids (SP) have been validated as potent predictive biomarkers of cardiovascular disease occurrence. The main objectives of the present study were to characterize the plasma SP profile in fasting T2D patients and to determine whether SP are modified in postprandial TGRL from these patients compared to fasting TGRL. In a randomized parallelgroup study, 30 T2D women ingested a breakfast including 20g lipids from either hazelnut cocoa palm oil-rich spread (Palm Nut) or Butter. Plasma was collected and TGRL were isolated by ultracentrifugation at fasting and 4h after the meal. Fasting samples of 6 control subjects from another cohort were analyzed for comparison. SP were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma from fasting T2D patients had higher ceramide (Cer) and ganglioside GM3 concentrations, and lower concentrations of sphingosylphosphorylcholine vs healthy subjects. In postprandial TGRL from T2D patients compared to those in the fasting state, Cer concentrations and especially C16:0, C24:1 and C24:0 molecular species, increased after the Palm Nut or Butter breakfast. A positive correlation was observed in the Palm Nut group between changes (D4h-fasting) of summed C16:0+C22:0+C24:1+C24:0 Cer concentrations in TGRL, and changes in plasma TG, TGRL-TG and TGRL-C16:0 concentrations. Altogether in T2D, the altered profile of plasma SP and the increased Cer concentrations in postprandial TGRL could contribute to the increased atherogenicity of TGRL.

The main purpose of the work was to assess whether saliva protein composition can reflect dietary habits in older adults, and how type 2 diabetes impacted on the saliva-diet correlates. Methods 214 participants were selected from 2 European cohorts of community-dwelling older adults (3C-Bordeaux and Seniors-ENRICA-2), using a case-control design nested in each cohort. Cases were individuals with type 2 diabetes. Dietary information was obtained using the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). Saliva was successfully obtained from 211 subjects, and its proteome analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results The relative abundance of 246 saliva proteins was obtained across all participants. The salivary proteome differed depending on the intake level of some food groups (especially vegetables, fruits, sweet snacks and red meat), in a diabetic status- and cohort-specific manner. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis suggested that some biological processes were consistently affected by diet across cohorts, for example enhanced platelet degranulation in high consumers of sweet snacks. Minimal models were then fitted to predict dietary variables by sociodemographic, clinical and salivary proteome variables. For the food group << sweet snacks >>, selected salivary proteins contributed to the predictive model and improved its performance in the Seniors-ENRICA-2 cohort and when both cohorts were combined.

Studies in the past decade have reported many novel biomarkers for predicting the new-onset or progression risk of renal dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) based on the genomic, metabolomic, and proteomic technologies. These novel predictive markers, however, are difficult to be widely used in clinical practice over the short term due to their high technology content, instability, and high cost. This study was aimed at evaluating the associations of clinical features and six traditional renal markers with the short-term risk of new-onset renal dysfunction in patients with T2D. Methods. This study involved 213 participants with T2D and normal renal function at baseline. The baseline levels of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), alpha-1-microglobulin-to-creatinine ratio (A1MCR), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin-to-creatinine ratio, transferrin-to-creatinine ratio (UTRF/Cr), and retinol-binding protein-to-creatinine ratio (URBP/Cr) were analyzed. Multivariate logistic models were established and validated. Results. During the two-year follow-up period, 23.01% participants progressed to renal dysfunction. The basal levels of ACR, A1MCR, UTRF/Cr, and URBP/Cr were the independent risk factors of new-onset renal dysfunction (P < 0.05). Several logistic models incorporating clinical characteristics and these renal markers were constructed for predicting the short-term risk of new-onset renal dysfunction. Comparatively, the model including age, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypertension, ACR, A1MCR, UTRF/Cr, and URBP/Cr levels at baseline had the highest potential (C - index = 0.785, P < 0.001). This model was validated using the K -fold cross-validation method; the accuracy was 0.815 +/- 0.013 in training sets and 0.784 +/- 0.019 in validation sets, indicating a good consistency for predicting the new-onset renal dysfunction risk. Finally, a nomogram based on this model was constructed to provide a quantitative tool to assess the individualized risk of short-term new-onset renal dysfunction. Conclusion. The model incorporating these markers and clinical features may have a high potential to predict the short-term risk of new-onset renal dysfunction.";;"Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University";;;;;;;;;;3;3;;;;;;;;;;;APR 20;2022;2022;;;;;;;;6289261;10.1155/2022/6289261;http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/6289261;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000982214600003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Identification of biomarkers for the screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of diabetes and its complications and better understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the development and progression of diabetes can facilitate individualized prevention and treatment. With the advancement of analytical techniques, metabolomics can identify and quantify multiple biomarkers simultaneously in a high-throughput manner. Providing information on underlying metabolic pathways, metabolomics can further identify mechanisms of diabetes and its progression. The application of metabolomics in epidemiological studies have identified novel biomarkers for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications, such as branched-chain amino acids, metabolites of phenylalanine, metabolites involved in energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Metabolomics have also been applied to explore the potential pathways modulated by medications. Investigating diabetes using a systems biology approach by integrating metabolomics with other omics data, such as genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and clinical data can present a comprehensive metabolic network and facilitate causal inference. In this regard, metabolomics can deepen the molecular understanding, help identify potential therapeutic targets, and improve the prevention and management of T2D and its complications. The current review focused on metabolomic biomarkers for kidney and cardiovascular disease in T2D identified from epidemiological studies, and will also provide a brief overview on metabolomic investigations for T2D.;;"Chinese University of Hong Kong; Prince of Wales Hospital; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong";;;;;;;;;;115;128;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2021;10;11;;;;;;;2832;10.3390/cells10112832;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cells10112832;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000725186600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Assessments included oral glucose tolerance test, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion. Participants with incident prediabetes were matched in age, sex, and ethnicity with nonprogressors.Interventions We assayed 58 sphingolipid species (ceramides, monohexosyl ceramides, sphingomyelins, and sphingosine) using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry in baseline plasma levels from participants and determined association with prediabetes risk.Main Outcome Measure The primary outcome was progression from normoglycemia to prediabetes, defined as impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance.Results The mean age of participants (N = 140; 50% Black, 50% female) was 48.1 +/- 8.69 years, body mass index 30.1 +/- 5.78 kg/m2, fasting plasma glucose 92.7 +/- 5.84 mg/dL, and 2-hour plasma glucose 121 +/- 23.3 mg/dL.

Although glycaemic control reduces microvascular complications, the effect of intensive treatment strategies or individual drugs on macrovascular diseases is still debated. RNA oxidation is associated with increased mortality in patients with T2D. Inspired by animal studies showing effect of a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor (empagliflozin) on oxidative stress and a recent trial evaluating empagliflozin that demonstrated improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2D at high risk of cardiovascular events, we hypothesise that empagliflozin lowers oxidative stress. Methods and analysis In this randomised, double-blinded and placebo-controlled study, 34 adult males with T2D will be randomised (1: 1) to empagliflozin or placebo once daily for 14 days as add-on to ongoing therapy. The primary endpoints will be changes in 24-hour urinary excretion of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGuo) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) determined before and after intervention (by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry). Additionally, fasting levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) will be determined in plasma before and after intervention (by high-performance liquid chromatography). Further, the plasma levels of iron, transferrin, transferrin-saturation, and ferritin are determined to correlate the iron metabolism to the markers of oxidative modifications.

Genetic mutations in MODY often cause nonsynonymous changes that directly lead to the functional distortion of proteins and the pathological consequences. Herein, we proposed that the inherited mutations found in a MODY family could cause a disturbance of protein abundance, specifically in serum. The serum samples were collected from a Uyghur MODY family through three generations, and the serum proteins after depletion treatment were examined by quantitative proteomics to characterize the MODY-related serum proteins followed by verification using target quantification of proteomics. A total of 32 serum proteins were preliminarily identified as the MODY-related. Further verification test toward the individual samples demonstrated the 12 candidates with the significantly different abundance in the MODY patients. A comparison of the 12 proteins among the sera of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, MODY, and healthy subjects was conducted and revealed a protein signature related with MODY composed of the serum proteins such as SERPINA7, APOC4, LPA, C6, and F5.;;"Xinjiang Medical University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI); Xinjiang Medical University";;;;;;;;;;3;3;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2018;17;1;;;;;670;679;;10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00727;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00727;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000419749800060;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, our understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remains incomplete and good biomarkers to objectively assess physical activity are lacking. Methods: We analyzed 3072 serum proteins in 26 men, normal weight or overweight, undergoing 12 weeks of a combined strength and endurance exercise intervention. We estimated insulin sensitivity with hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, maximum oxygen uptake, muscle strength, and used MRI/MRS to evaluate body composition and organ fat depots. Muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were used for mRNA sequencing. Additional association analyses were performed in samples from up to 47,747 individuals in the UK Biobank, as well as using two-sample Mendelian randomization and mice models. Results: Following 12 weeks of exercise intervention, we observed significant changes in 283 serum proteins. Notably, 66 of these proteins were elevated in overweight men and positively associated with liver fat before the exercise regimen, but were normalized after exercise. Furthermore, for 19.7 and 12.1% of the exercise-responsive proteins, corresponding changes in mRNA expression levels in muscle and fat, respectively, were shown. The protein CD300LG displayed consistent alterations in blood, muscle, and fat. Serum CD300LG exhibited positive associations with insulin sensitivity, and to angiogenesis-related gene expression in both muscle and fat. Furthermore, serum CD300LG was positively associated with physical activity and negatively associated with glucose levels in the UK Biobank. In this sample, the association between serum CD300LG and physical activity was significantly stronger in men than in women. Mendelian randomization analysis suggested potential causal relationships between levels of serum CD300LG and fasting glucose, 2 hr glucose after an oral glucose tolerance test, and HbA1c. Additionally, Cd300lg responded to exercise in a mouse model, and we observed signs of impaired glucose tolerance in male, but not female, Cd300lg knockout mice. Conclusions: Our study identified several novel proteins in serum whose levels change in response to prolonged exercise and were significantly associated with body composition, liver fat, and glucose homeostasis. Serum CD300LG increased with physical activity and is a potential causal link to improved glucose levels.

Proteins linked to these constructs were implicated in inflammation, antiviral responses and complement systems. More than half of these proteins were prospectively linked to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and mortality during a 14 year follow-up. Moreover, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis suggested causal relationships from loneliness to five proteins, with two proteins (ADM and ASGR1) further supported by colocalization. These MR-identified proteins (GFRA1, ADM, FABP4, TNFRSF10A and ASGR1) exhibited broad associations with other blood biomarkers, as well as volumes in brain regions involved in interoception and emotional and social processes.

Among the possible causes, the excess of red meat and the insufficiency of vegetables consumption are suspected. Such an alimentation is associated with nutritional biomarkers, including trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and its precursors. Here, we aimed to study these biomarkers as potential prognostic factors for HF in patients with T2D. Methods We used the SURDIAGENE (SURvival DIAbetes and GENEtics) study, a large, prospective, monocentric cohort study including 1468 patients with T2D between 2001 and 2012. TMAO and its precursors (trimethylamine [TMA], betaine, choline, and carnitine) as well as thio-amino-acids (cysteine, homocysteine and methionine) were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The main outcome was HF requiring Hospitalization (HFrH) defined as the first occurrence of acute HF leading to hospitalization and/or death, established by an adjudication committee, based on hospital records until 31st December 2015. The secondary outcomes were the composite event HFrH and/or cardiovascular death and all-cause death. The association between the biomarkers and the outcomes was studied using cause-specific hazard-models, adjusted for age, sex, history of coronary artery disease, NT-proBNP, CKD-EPI-derived eGFR and the urine albumin/creatinine ratio. Hazard-ratios (HR) are expressed for one standard deviation. Results The data of interest were available for 1349/1468 of SURDIAGENE participants (91.9%), including 569 (42.2%) women, with a mean age of 64.3 +/- 10.7 years and a median follow-up of 7.3 years [25th-75th percentile, 4.7-10.8]. HFrH was reported in 209 patients (15.5%), HFrH and/or cardiovascular death in 341 (25.3%) and all-cause death in 447 (33.1%). In unadjusted hazard-models, carnitine (HR = 1.20, 95% CI [1.05; 1.37]), betaine (HR = 1.34, [1.20; 1.50]), choline (HR = 1.35, [1.20; 1.52]), TMAO (HR = 1.32, [1.16; 1.50]), cysteine (HR = 1.38, [1.21; 1.58]) and homocysteine (HR = 1.28, [1.17; 1.39]) were associated with HFrH, but not TMA and methionine. In the fully adjusted models, none of these associations was significant, neither for HFrH nor for HFrH and/or CV death, when homocysteine only was positively associated with all-cause death (HR = 1.16, [1.06; 1.27]).

Targeting senescent cells for selective removal or altering the proteins they release are promising therapeutic strategies against age-related diseases. However, the biology of senescent cells is complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous. In order to better identify pathology-driving senescent cells and develop therapies to alter their complex biology or drive them toward cell death, a detailed and comprehensive understanding of senescence-associated proteins and the mechanisms that enable senescent cells to evade cell death is required. Major developments in proteomic workflows over the past decade have enabled an increasingly comprehensive, quantitative, and specific molecular profiling and interrogation of cellular mechanisms. In this review, we discuss the current state of translational senescence research and how modern proteomic technologies, particularly mass spectrometry-based proteomics, can accelerate our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that drive senescence and robustly probe the proteomic phenotypes of heterogenous populations of senescent cells. We will focus on how these fundamental biological insights will ultimately accelerate the development of senescence-targeting therapies, or senotherapeutics.Abstract Cellular senescence is a state of irreversible growth arrest with profound phenotypic changes, including the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescent cell accumulation contributes to aging and many pathologies including chronic inflammation, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Targeted removal of senescent cells in preclinical models promotes health and longevity, suggesting that the selective elimination of senescent cells is a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating a myriad of age-related pathologies in humans. However, moving senescence-targeting drugs (senotherapeutics) into the clinic will require therapeutic targets and biomarkers, fueled by an improved understanding of the complex and dynamic biology of senescent cell populations and their molecular profiles, as well as the mechanisms underlying the emergence and maintenance of senescence cells and the SASP. Advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies and workflows have the potential to address these needs. Here, we review the state of translational senescence research and how proteomic approaches have added to our knowledge of senescence biology to date. Further, we lay out a roadmap from fundamental biological discovery to the clinical translation of senotherapeutic approaches through the development and application of emerging proteomic technologies, including targeted and untargeted proteomic approaches, bottom-up and top-down methods, stability proteomics, and surfaceomics. These technologies are integral for probing the cellular composition and dynamics of senescent cells and, ultimately, the development of senotype-specific biomarkers and senotherapeutics (senolytics and senomorphics). This review aims to highlight emerging areas and applications of proteomics that will aid in exploring new senescent cell biology and the future translation of senotherapeutics.;;"National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2023;12;10;;;;;;;1301;10.3390/biology12101301;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology12101301;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001092490400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we develop a large-scale lipid analysis platform by coupling online C=C derivatization through the Paterno-Buchi reaction with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. This provides rich information on lipid C=C location isomers, revealing C=C locations for more than 200 unsaturated glycerophospholipids in bovine liver among which we identify 55 groups of C=C location isomers. By analyzing tissue samples of patients with breast cancer and type 2 diabetes plasma samples, we find that the ratios of C=C isomers are much less affected by interpersonal variations than their individual abundances, suggesting that isomer ratios may be used for the discovery of lipid biomarkers.;;"Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Hubei University of Medicine";;;;;;;;;;160;182;;;;;;;;;;;JAN 8;2019;10;;;;;;;;79;10.1038/s41467-018-07963-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07963-8;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000455102900018;View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent studies have shown that these mice also display aspects of psychosis and depression-like behaviors as seen in some psychiatric disorders. Here, we have performed multiplex immunoassay and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry profiling of the plasma and brain samples from db/db and control mice to identify altered pathways, which could be related to these behavioral abnormalities. This is the first study to carry out profiling of the brain proteome in this model. Plasma from the db/db mice had increased levels of leptin and insulin, decreased levels of peptide YY, glucagon and prolactin and alterations in inflammation-related proteins, compared with control mice. Frontal cortex tissue from the db/db mice showed changes in proteins involved in energy metabolism, cellular structure and neural functioning, and the hippocampus had changes in proteins involved in the same pathways, with additional effects on cellular signalling proteins. The overlap of these findings with effects seen in type 2 diabetes, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and Alzheimer's disease might contribute to a common endophenotype seen in metabolic and neurological disorders.;;"University of Cambridge; University System of Ohio; Wright State University Dayton; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus MC";;;;;;;;;;43;46;;;;;;;;;;;MAY;2013;3;;;;;;;;e263;10.1038/tp.2013.42;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/tp.2013.42;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000321184400009;View Full Record in Web of Science

Although classical biomarkers such as age, HbA1c and diabetes duration are associated with glycaemic progression, it is unclear how well such variables predict insulin initiation or requirement and whether newly identified markers have added predictive value.MethodsIn two prospective cohort studies as part of IMI-RHAPSODY, we investigated whether clinical variables and three types of molecular markers (metabolites, lipids, proteins) can predict time to insulin requirement using different machine learning approaches (lasso, ridge, GRridge, random forest). Clinical variables included age, sex, HbA1c, HDL-cholesterol and C-peptide. Models were run with unpenalised clinical variables (i.e. always included in the model without weights) or penalised clinical variables, or without clinical variables. Model development was performed in one cohort and the model was applied in a second cohort. Model performance was evaluated using Harrel's C statistic.ResultsOf the 585 individuals from the Hoorn Diabetes Care System (DCS) cohort, 69 required insulin during follow-up (1.0-11.4 years); of the 571 individuals in the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (GoDARTS) cohort, 175 required insulin during follow-up (0.3-11.8 years). Overall, the clinical variables and proteins were selected in the different models most often, followed by the metabolites. The most frequently selected clinical variables were HbA1c (18 of the 36 models, 50%), age (15 models, 41.2%) and C-peptide (15 models, 41.2%). Base models (age, sex, BMI, HbA1c) including only clinical variables performed moderately in both the DCS discovery cohort (C statistic 0.71 [95% CI 0.64, 0.79]) and the GoDARTS replication cohort (C 0.71 [95% CI 0.69, 0.75]). A more extensive model including HDL-cholesterol and C-peptide performed better in both cohorts (DCS, C 0.74 [95% CI 0.67, 0.81]; GoDARTS, C 0.73 [95% CI 0.69, 0.77]). Two proteins, lactadherin and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor, were most consistently selected and slightly improved model performance.Conclusions/interpretationUsing machine learning approaches, we show that insulin requirement risk can be modestly well predicted by predominantly clinical variables. Inclusion of molecular markers improves the prognostic performance beyond that of clinical variables by up to 5%. Such prognostic models could be useful for identifying people with diabetes at high risk of progressing quickly to treatment intensification.Data availabilitySummary statistics of lipidomic, proteomic and metabolomic data are available from a Shiny dashboard at https://rhapdata-app.vital-it.ch.";;"University of Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Leiden University - Excl LUMC; University of Dundee; Delft University of Technology; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics; University of Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Universite de Montreal; Imperial College London; Nanyang Technological University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Utrecht University; Utrecht University Medical Center";;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;MAY;2024;67;5;;;;;885;894;;10.1007/s00125-024-06105-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-024-06105-8;;FEB 2024;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001164493400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, human lipidomic studies have been inconsistent, owing to the use of indirect proxy measures of metabolic outcomes and relatively limited coverage of the lipidome. Here, we employed comprehensive lipid profiling and gold-standard metabolic measures to test the hypothesis that distinct lipid signatures in obesity may signify early stages of pathogenesis toward type 2 diabetes. Methods: Using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, we profiled > 450 lipid species across 26 classes in 65 overweight or obese non-diabetic individuals. Intensive metabolic testing was conducted using direct gold-standard measures of adiposity (% body fat by dual X-ray absorptiometry), insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps), and insulin secretion (intravenous glucose tolerance tests), as well as measurement of serum inflammatory cytokines and adipokines (multiplex assays; flow cytometry). Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were computed using Matlab R2011a, and all analyses were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Results: We present new evidence showing a strong and independent positive correlation between the lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) lipid class and insulin secretion in vivo in humans (beta [95% CI] = 781.9 [353.3, 1210.4], p = 0.01), supporting the insulinotropic effects of LPI demonstrated in mouse islets. Dihydroceramide, a sphingolipid precursor, was independently and negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity (13 [95% CI] = -1.9 [ - 2.9, - 0.9], p = 0.01), indicating a possible upregulation in sphingolipid synthesis in obese individuals. These associations remained significant in multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, and % body fat. The dihexosylceramide class correlated positively with interleukin-10 before and after adjustment for age, sex, and % body fat (p = 0.02), while the phosphatidylethanolamine class and its vinyl ether-linked (plasmalogen) derivatives correlated negatively with % body fat in both univariable and age- and sex-adjusted models (all p < 0.04). Conclusions: Our data suggest that these lipid classes may signify early pathogenesis toward type 2 diabetes and could serve as novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers for diabetes prevention.";;"Monash University; Monash University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT)";;;;;;;;;;31;35;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2019;1864;3;;;;;335;343;;10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.12.014;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2018.12.014;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000471838500012;View Full Record in Web of Science

Microalbuminuria has been established as a risk factor for the development of diabetic renal disease. Recently, microalbuminuria has been reported to have limitations in determining disease risk and predicting DN Therefore, identification of more specific biomarkers for prediction of DN is needed. Experimental design. When kidney damage is initiated, glycoprotein leakage into the blood may occur, thus altering the glycoproteome profile of the blood. Here, we have used a combined approach of glycoprotein enrichment of plasma with a proteomic analysis to discover potential DN biomarkers. We isolated glycoproteins from plasma provided by six type 2 diabetes control (DC) and six type 2 DN patients using multi-lectin affinity chromatography. Captured glycoproteins were resolved by 1-D PAGE and tryptic digests of isolated proteins were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Results: From the comparative and semi-quantitative proteome analysis, we identified 13 up- and 14 down-regulated glycoproteins in DN plasma. Among the up-regulated glycoproteins, the levels of lumican, vasorin and retinol binding protein-4 were verified by Western blot analysis of individual plasma samples.

Serum proteins were analyzed by a proteomic approach using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS. Gels were stained with Pro-Q Emerald 488 to analyze the serum glycoproteome, followed by silver nitrate to examine the total serum proteome. Patient sera were divided into four groups according to their microalbuminuria index: type 2 diabetics with normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, and overt nephropathy, and healthy subjects. When the HbA1c levels of the diabetic groups were examined, groups with higher HbA1c exhibited higher fructosamine levels, suggesting that the loss of glycemic control affected the glycation of serum proteins. The proteins that became glycated under poor glycemic control were PEDF, apolipoprotein J precursor, hemopexin, immunoglobulin mu heavy chain, and immunoglobulin kappa chain. As albuminuria increased, a marker of kidney damage, the levels of glycated prekallikrein and complement factor C4B3 also increased.

Recent findings Although less frequently than in type 2 diabetes, DKD may develop also in nonproteinuric type 1 diabetes. However, the progression rate to kidney failure in nonproteinuric diabetic people is much lower than in proteinuric ones. A new proteomic biomarker, the chronic kidney disease (CKD) 273, reliably predicts the risk of incident micro and macroalbuminuria and of CKD in nonalbuminuric diabetic people. SGLT2 inhibition markedly reduces albuminuria in macro and microalbuminuric patients and discernibly mitigates albumin excretion also in those with albuminuria in the normal range. Summary Studies focusing on risk factors for DKD in nonproteinuric patients are a clinical research priority. The CKD273 classifier is a promising biomarker for the early identification of nonproteinuric patients at high risk for progressive DKD.

The disease process that underlies progressive renal decline comprises factors that increase risk as well as factors that protect against this outcome. Using untargeted proteomic profiling of circulating proteins from individuals in two independent cohorts with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and varying stages of DKD followed for 7 to 15 years, we identified three elevated plasma proteins-fibroblast growth factor 20 (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88), angiopoietin-1 (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.91), and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 12 (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.95)that were associated with protection against progressive renal decline and progression to ESRD. The combined effect of these three protective proteins was demonstrated by very low cumulative risk of ESRD in those who had baseline concentrations above median for all three proteins, whereas the cumulative risk of ESRD was high in those with concentrations below median for these proteins at the beginning of follow- up. This protective effect was shown to be independent from circulating inflammatory proteins and clinical covariates and was confirmed in a third cohort of diabetic individuals with normal renal function. These three protective proteins may serve as biomarkers to stratify diabetic individuals according to risk of progression to ESRD and might also be investigated as potential therapeutics to delay or prevent the onset of ESRD.";;"Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Joslin Diabetes Center, Inc.; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Jagiellonian University; Collegium Medicum Jagiellonian University; Eli Lilly; Lilly Research Laboratories; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center";;;;;;;;;;22;22;;;;;;;;;;;JUN 30;2021;13;600;;;;;;;eabd2699;10.1126/scitranslmed.abd2699;http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abd2699;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000678119000004;View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aimed to decipher the causal associations of circulating proteins with fasting glucose (FG), 2-h glucose after an oral glucose challenge (2hGlu), fasting insulin (FI), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) using large-scale proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Genetic data on plasma proteomes were obtained from 10 proteomic genome-wide association studies. Both cis-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) and cis + trans-pQTLs MR analyses were conducted. Bayesian colocalization, Steiger filtering analysis, assessment of protein-altering variants, and mapping expression QTLs to pQTLs were performed to investigate the reliability of the MR findings. Protein-protein interaction, pathway enrichment analysis, and evaluation of drug targets were performed. Thirty-three proteins were identified with causal effects on FG, FI, or HbA1c but not 2hGlu in the cis-pQTL analysis, and 93 proteins had causal effects on glycemic traits in the cis + trans-pQTLs analysis. Most proteins were either considered druggable or drug targets. In conclusion, many novel circulating protein biomarkers were identified to be causally associated with glycemic traits.

With worldwide progress in the analysis of whole genomes, the knowledge base in gene sequence and expression data useful for protein and peptide analysis has drastically increased. The medical need for relevant biomarkers is enormous. This is particularly true for the many types of cancer, but other diseases such as Type 2 diabetes also lack useful and adequate diagnostic markers with high specificity and sensitivity. Despite advances in imaging technologies for early detection of diseases, proteomic and peptidomic multiplex techniques have evolved in recent years. This review focuses on the application of peptidomics technologies to peptides in health and disease. Peptidomics technologies provide new opportunities for the detection of low-molecular-weight proteome biomarkers (peptides) by mass spectrometry. Improvements in peptidomics research are based on separation of peptides and/or proteins by their physicochemical properties in combination with mass spectrometric detection, identification and sophisticated bioinformatics tools for data analysis. Therefore, peptidomics technologies offer an opportunity to discover novel biomarkers for diagnosis and management of disease (e.g., prognosis, treatment decision and monitoring response to therapy).;;;;;;;;;;;;71;86;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2005;5;2;;;;;145;157;;10.1586/14737159.5.2.145;http://dx.doi.org/10.1586/14737159.5.2.145;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000230163700003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods We studied three groups (n = 6 per group) of males with Type 2 diabetes: (1) normal renal function; (2) classical diabetic nephropathy (urinary albumincreatinine ratio > 1000 mg/g and glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min.1.73 m2) and (3) non-albuminuric diabetic nephropathy (glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min.1.73 m2 and urinary albumincreatinine ratio < 30 mg/g). We used two-dimensional fluorescence differential gel electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry peptide identification and western blot validation in the study. Results Sixty protein spots were differentially abundant between the non-albuminuric and macro-albuminuric subjects (> 2.5-fold, P < 0.05). In the non-albuminuric subjects, in addition to previously reported a1-microglobulin, the next most interesting spot (upregulated 3.44-fold, P = 0.0026) was human zinc-a2-glycoprotein, a novel adipose-cytokine associated with glomerular injury.

Recent epidemiological studies have incriminated diabetes as a risk factor for the development of OSCC, as well as oral premalignant lesions. As for the last 20 years diabetes and oral squamous cell carcinoma rates have been increasing rapidly, therefore a reliable detection method of major saliva proteins as possible biomarkers for OSCC is of key priority. In this study we collected whole saliva samples from patients with diabetes and from healthy subjects. To reduce the risk of failure and to keep the investigation good reproducible, we proposed an examination and saliva collecting technique. The proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Our findings show that the expression of Annexin A8, Peroxiredoxin-2 and Tyrosine kinase is elevated by patients having diabetes. All these proteins have been previously described in cancer saliva samples also in OSCC. Our current findings showed that testing saliva may be an effective and reliable method for detecting oral cancer in early stages.;;"University of Pecs; University of Pecs; University of Pecs; University of Pecs; University of Pecs";;;;;;;;;;9;9;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2014;20;3;;;;;591;595;;10.1007/s12253-013-9736-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12253-013-9736-8;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000338274900014;View Full Record in Web of Science

Currently, changes in albuminuria status are thought to be a primary indicator of the onset or progression of DKD, yet progressive nephropathy and renal impairment can occur in certain diabetic individuals who exhibit normal urinary albumin levels, emphasizing the lack of sensitivity and specificity associated with the use of albuminuria as a biomarker for detecting diabetic kidney disease and predicting DKD risk. According to the study, a non-invasive method for early detection or prediction of DKD may involve combining proteomic analytical techniques such second generation sequencing, mass spectrometry, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and other advanced system biology algorithms. Another category of proteins of relevance may now be provided by renal tissue biomarkers. The establishment of reliable proteomic biomarkers of DKD represents a novel approach to improving the diagnosis, prognostic evaluation, and treatment of affected patients. In the present review, a series of protein biomarkers that have been characterized to date are discussed, offering a theoretical foundation for future efforts to aid patients suffering from this debilitating microvascular complication.;;"Soochow University - China; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Institute of Medical Biology - CAMS; Yunnan Key Laboratory of Vaccine Research & Development on Severe Infectious Diseases; Peking Union Medical College; Soochow University - China";;;;;;;;;;7;8;;;;;;;;;;;;2023;16;;;;;;117;128;;10.2147/DMSO.S392888;http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/DMSO.S392888;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000915258400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

GDM is considered a high-risk state which may lead to type II diabetes which is associated with an increase in a number of interrelated adverse perinatal outcomes. Given the fact that the progress of a successful pregnancy is dependent on the intricate communication between several biological molecules, identification of the proteomic profile perturbations in women with GDM is expected to help in understanding the disease pathogenesis and also discovery of clinical biomarker(s). In recent years, both gel-free and gel-based proteomics have been extensively investigated for improving maternal and child health. Although there are several reports integrating various aspects of proteomics in pregnancy related diseases such as preeclampsia, extensive Pubmed search shows no review so far on the application of proteomics in gestational diabetes. In this review, we focus on various high-throughput proteomic technologies for the identification of unique biosignatures and biomarkers responsible for the early prediction of GDM. Further, different analytical strategies and biological samples involved in proteomic analysis of this pregnancy-related disease are discussed.

We recently demonstrated that the expression of secreted leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein-1 (LRG1) is associated with worsened kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and that LRG1 enhances endothelial transforming growth factor-beta signaling to promote diabetic kidney disease progression. While the increased expression of LRG1 was most prominent in the glomerular endothelial cells in diabetic kidneys, its increase was also observed in the tubulointerstitial compartment. Here, we explored the potential role of LRG1 in kidney epithelial cells and TGF-beta- mediated tubulointerstitial fibrosis independent of diabetes. LRG1 expression was induced by tumor necrosis factor-a in cultured kidney epithelial cells and potentiated TGF-beta/Smad3 signal transduction. Global Lrg1 loss in mice led to marked attenuation of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in models of unilateral ureteral obstruction and aristolochic acid fibrosis associated with concomitant decreases in Smad3 phosphorylation in tubule epithelial cells. In mice with kidney epithelial cell-specific LRG1 overexpression, while no significant phenotypes were observed at baseline, marked exacerbation of tubulointerstitial fibrosis was observed in the obstructed kidneys. This was associated with enhanced Smad3 phosphorylation in both kidney epithelial cells and asmooth muscle actin-positive interstitial cells. Co-culture of kidney epithelial cells with primary kidney fibroblasts confirmed the potentiation of TGF-beta-mediated Smad3 activation in kidney fibroblasts through epithelial-derived LRG1. Thus, our results indicate that enhanced LRG1 expression-induced epithelial injury is an amplifier of TGF-beta signaling in autocrine and paracrine manners promoting tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Hence, therapeutic targeting of LRG1 may be an effective means to curtail kidney fibrosis progression in chronic kidney disease.;;"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Xiamen University; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); James J.

Identification of novel biomarkers are needed to distinguish metabolic syndrome from equally obese individuals in order to direct them to early interventions that reduce their risk of developing further health problems. We utilized mass spectrometry-based targeted metabolic profiling of 221 metabolites to evaluate the associations between metabolite profiles and established metabolic syndrome criteria (i.e. elevated waist circumference, hypertension, elevated fasting glucose, elevated triglycerides, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) in plasma samples from obese men (n = 29; BMI = 35.5 +/- 5.2 kg/m(2)) and women (n = 40; 34.9 +/- 6.7 kg/m(2)), of which 26 met the criteria for metabolic syndrome (17 men and 9 women). Compared to obese individuals without metabolic syndrome, univariate statistical analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis showed that a specific group of metabolites from multiple metabolic pathways (i.e. purine metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, and tryptophan metabolism) were associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome. Receiver operating characteristic curves generated based on the PLS-DA models showed excellent areas under the curve (0.85 and 0.96, for metabolites only model and enhanced metabolites model, respectively), high specificities (0.86 and 0.93), and good sensitivities (0.71 and 0.91).

We established a proteomics approach for identification of diabetic nephropathy-related biomarkers in urine. Methods: We used SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry and SAX2 protein arrays to compare protein profiles from urine of 4 defined patient groups. Samples from patients with type 2 diabetes (DM; n = 45) without nephropathy and without microalbuminuria (DMWNP), patients with DM with macro- or microalbuminuria (DM-NP; n = 38), patients with proteinuria due to nondiabetic renal disease (n = 34), and healthy controls (n = 45) were analyzed. Anionic exchange, reversedphase fractionation, gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry were used to isolate and identify proteins with high discriminatory power. Results: A protein with mlz 6188 (P <0.0000004) was strongly released in the urine of healthy controls, patients with proteinuria due to nondiabetic disease, and DM-WNP in contrast to DM-NP patients. An mlz 14 766 protein (P <0.00008) was selectively excreted in the urine of DM-NP patients, whereas the protein with mlz 11774 (P <0.000004) was significantly excreted by patients with proteinuria and DM-NP. The mlz 11774 and mlz 14 766 mass peaks were identified as beta-microglobulin and UbA52, a ubiquitin ribosomal fusion protein, respectively. The protein with mlz 6188 was identified as a processed form of ubiquitin. Conclusion: The release of high amounts of UbA52 in urine of DM-NP patients could serve as a diagnostic marker, whereas the lack of the short form of ubiquitin raises interesting questions about the pathophysiology.

Our goal was to develop a new method for protein biomarker discovery in urine from these patients.

Proteins were separated using a novel analysis process including immunodepletion of high-abundance proteins followed by two-stage LC fractionation of low-abundance proteins. The proteins in the fractions were sequenced using MS/MS. Results: Immunodepletion of selected high-abundance proteins followed by two-stage LC produced approximately 700 fractions, each less complex and more amenable to analysis than the mixture and requiring minimal processing for MS identification. Comparison of fractions between normal and diabetic nephropathy subjects revealed several low-abundance proteins that reproducibly distinguished low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from both high GFR diabetic and normal subjects, including uteroglobin, a protein previously associated with renal scarring.

To dissect the underlying mechanisms, we performed a multiplexed proteomics study on liver mitochondria isolated from a spontaneous diabetic rat model before/after they were rendered diabetic. Altogether, we identified 1091 mitochondrial proteins, 228 phosphoproteins, and 355 hydroxyproteins. Mitochondrial proteins were found to undergo expression changes in a highly correlated fashion during T2D development. For example, proteins involved in beta-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and other bioenergetic processes were coordinately up-regulated, indicating that liver cells confronted T2D by increasing energy expenditure and activating pathways that rid themselves of the constitutively increased flux of glucose and lipid. Notably, activation of oxidative phosphorylation was immediately related to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which caused oxidative stress within the cells. Increased oxidative stress was also evidenced by our post-translational modification profiles such that mitochondrial proteins were more heavily hydroxylated during T2D development. Moreover, we observed a distinct depression of antiapoptosis and antioxidative stress proteins that might reflect a higher apoptotic index under the diabetic stage. We suggest that such changes in systematic metabolism were causally linked to the development of T2D. Comparing proteomics data against microarray data, we demonstrated that many T2D-related alterations were unidentifiable by either proteomics or genomics approaches alone, underscoring the importance of integrating different approaches. Our compendium could help to unveil pathogenic events in mitochondria leading to T2D and be useful for the discovery of diagnosis biomarker and therapeutic targets of T2D.

Prior studies have reported that elevated concentrations of several plasma amino acids (AA), particularly branched chain (BCAA) and aromatic AA predict the onset of type 2 diabetes. We sought to test the hypothesis that circulating BCAA, aromatic AA and related AA metabolites decline in response to the use of insulin sensitizing agents in overweight/obese adults with impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes. Methods. We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo, controlled study conducted in twenty five overweight/obese (BMI similar to 30 kg/m(2)) adults with impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes. Participants were randomized to three months of pioglitazone (45 mg per day) plus metformin (1000 mg twice per day, N = 12 participants) or placebo (N = 13). We measured insulin sensitivity by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and fasting concentrations of AA and AA metabolites using ultra-pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry before and after the three-month intervention. Results. Insulin sensitizer therapy that significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity reduced 9 out of 33 AA and AA metabolites measured compared to placebo treatment. Moreover, insulin sensitizer therapy significantly reduced three functionally clustered AA and metabolite pairs: i) phenylalanine/tyrosine, citrulline/arginine, and lysine/alpha-aminoadipic acid. Conclusions. Reductions in plasma concentrations of several AA and AA metabolites in response to three months of insulin sensitizer therapy support the concept that reduced insulin sensitivity alters AA and AA metabolites.

Oxysterols are associated with atherogenesis, neurodegeneration, and inflammation. We developed a GC-MS method for the simultaneous analysis of these species in human plasma, including 24-, 25-, 27-hydroxycholesterol; 7-ketocholesterol; lanosterol; lathosterol; 7-dehydrocholesterol; desmosterol; stigmasterol; sitosterol; and campesterol. METHODS: Sterols were hydrolyzed with ethanolic potassium hydroxide solution, extracted by liquid/liquid extraction with n-hexane, and derivatized with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoracetamide. Positive chemical ionization with ammonia, as reagent gas, was applied to generate high abundant precursor ions. RESULTS: The definition of highly sensitive precursor/product ion transitions, especially for coeluting substances, allowed fast gas chromatography run times of under 8.5 min. Using the multiple reaction monitoring mode, detection limits in the picogram per milliliter range could be achieved for most compounds. The method was validated for precision and recovery. Intraassay and interassay CVs were mostly <15% for serum and plasma samples. The recoveries of supplemented plasma samples in different concentrations were 88%-117%. The method was applied to stratification of patients with disorders in cholesterol biosynthesis and/or cholesterol absorption in hypercholesterolemia. The method revealed associations of sterol species with thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: This method allows high-throughput sterol profiling in various diseases.

Further validation with blinded serum samples from an independent cohort (10 healthy control and 10 type 1 diabetics) demonstrated that peptides from platelet basic protein and C1 inhibitor achieved both 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for classification of samples. The disease specificity of these proteins was assessed using sera from 50 age-matched type 2 diabetic individuals, and a subset of proteins, C1 inhibitor in particular, were exceptionally good discriminators between these two forms of diabetes.

Finding early biomarkers for detecting asymptomatic patients with CVD can improve survival. Recently, plasma proteomics-targeted selected reaction monitoring/multiple reaction monitoring analyses (MRM)-has emerged as highly specific and sensitive tools compared with classic ELISA methods. The objective was to identify differentially regulated proteins according to the severity of the coronary artery atherosclerosis. Research design and methods A discovery cohort, a verification cohort and a validation cohort consisted of 18, 53, and 228 subjects, respectively. The grade of coronary artery stenosis was defined as a percentage of luminal stenosis of the major coronary arteries. Participants were divided into six groups, depending on the presence of diabetes and the grade of coronary artery stenosis. Two mass spectrometric approaches were employed: (1) conventional shotgun liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for a discovery and (2) quantitative MRM for verification and validation. An analysis of the covariance was used to examine the biomarkers' predictivity beyond conventional cardiovascular risks. Results A total of 1349 different proteins were identified from a discovery cohort. We selected 52 proteins based on the tandem mass tag quantitative analysis then summarized as follows: chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 7 (CXCL7), apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2), human lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) in diabetes; CXCL7, APOC2, LBP, complement 4A (C4A), vitamin D-binding protein (VTDB) and laminin beta 1 subunit in non-diabetes.

The search for new and better biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy has, with a few exceptions, previously focused on either hypothesis-driven studies or urinary based investigations. To date only two studies have investigated the proteome of blood in search for new biomarkers, and these studies were conducted in sera from patients with type 2 diabetes. This is the first reported in depth proteomic study where plasma from type 1 diabetic patients was investigated with the goal of finding improved candidate biomarkers to predict diabetic nephropathy. In order to reach lower concentration proteins in plasma a pre-fractionation step, either hexapeptide bead-based libraries or anion exchange chromatography, was performed prior to surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. Results: Proteomic analysis of plasma from a cross-sectional cohort of 123 type 1 diabetic patients previously diagnosed as normoalbuminuric, microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric, gave rise to 290 peaks clusters of which 16 were selected as the most promising biomarker candidates based on statistical performance, including independent component analysis. Four of the peaks that were discovered have been identified as transthyretin, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein C1 and cystatin C. Several yet unidentified proteins discovered by this novel approach appear to have more potential as biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the capacity of proteomic analysis of plasma, by confirming the presence of known biomarkers as well as revealing new biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy in plasma in type 1 diabetic patients.;;"Novo Nordisk; Hagedorn Research Institute; Steno Diabetes Center; University of Copenhagen; Niels Bohr Institute";;;;;;;;;;33;39;;;;;;;;;;;FEB 3;2010;8;;;;;;;;4;10.1186/1477-5956-8-4;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1477-5956-8-4;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000275040600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Using aptamer-based proteomics, we characterized arterial (A)-to-renal venous (V) gradients for >1,300 proteins in 22 individuals who underwent invasive sampling. Although most of the proteins that changed significantly decreased from A to V, consistent with renal clearance, several were found to increase, the most significant of which was testican-2. To assess the clinical implications of these physiologic findings, we examined proteomic data in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), an African-American cohort (n = 1,928), with replication in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), a White cohort (n = 1,621). In both populations, testican-2 had a strong, positive correlation with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In addition, higher baseline testican-2 levels were associated with a lower rate of eGFR decline in models adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, baseline eGFR, and albuminuria. Glomerular expression of testican-2 in human kidneys was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy, while single-cell RNA sequencing of human kidneys showed expression of the cognate gene, SPOCK2, exclusively in podocytes. In vitro, testican-2 increased glomerular endothelial tube formation and motility, raising the possibility that its secretion has a functional role within the glomerulus. Taken together, our findings identify testican-2 as a podocyte-derived biomarker of kidney health and prognosis.;;"Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Massachusetts General Hospital; University of Mississippi; University of Mississippi Medical Center; University of Rochester; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard University; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Massachusetts General Hospital; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Lund University; Lund University; Skane University Hospital; University of Gothenburg; Sahlgrenska University Hospital; University of Gothenburg; Boston University; Boston University; Boston University; Framingham Heart Study; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI); Washington University (WUSTL); University of Texas System; University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas";;;;;;;;;;26;27;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 6;2020;117;40;;;;;25026;25035;;10.1073/pnas.2009606117;http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009606117;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000579045200008;View Full Record in Web of Science

It is not expected to slow down staying one of the leading cases of preventable death and resulting in an increased clinical and economic burden. Poor lifestyle choices and excessive intake of cheap calories are major contributors to obesity, triggering type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and other comorbidities. Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for development of obesity is essential as it might result in the introducing of anti-obesity targets and early-stage obesity biomarkers, allowing the distinction between metabolic syndromes. The complex nature of this disease, coupled with the phenomenon of metabolically healthy obesity, inspired us to perform data-centric, hypothesis-generating pilot research, aimed to find correlations between parameters of classic clinical blood tests and proteomic profiles of 104 lean and obese subjects. As the result, we assembled patterns of proteins, which presence or absence allows predicting the weight of the patient fairly well. We believe that such proteomic patterns with high prediction power should facilitate the translation of potential candidates into biomarkers of clinical use for early-stage stratification of obesity therapy.;;"Russian Academy of Medical Sciences; Institute of Biomedical Chemistry; Russian Academy of Sciences; Federal Research Center of Nutrition, Biotechnology & Food Safety; Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation; Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation; Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University";;;;;;;;;;5;5;;;;;;;;;;;FEB;2021;11;2;;;;;;;64;10.3390/jpm11020064;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jpm11020064;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000622694900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

On the one hand multifactorial studies with complex experimental design are required for its comprehensive analysis. On the other hand, the data from these studies often include a substantial amount of redundancy such as proteins that are typically represented by a multitude of peptides. Coping simultaneously with both complexities (experimental and technological) makes data analysis a challenge for Bioinformatics. Results: We present a comprehensive work-flow tailored for analyzing complex data including data from multifactorial studies. The developed approach aims at revealing effects caused by a distinct combination of experimental factors, in our case genotype and diet. Applying the developed work-flow to the analysis of an established polygenic mouse model for diet-induced type 2 diabetes, we found peptides with significant fold changes exclusively for the combination of a particular strain and diet. Exploitation of redundancy enables the visualization of peptide correlation and provides a natural way of feature selection for classification and prediction. Classification based on the features selected using our approach performs similar to classifications based on more complex feature selection methods. Conclusions: The combination of ANOVA and redundancy exploitation allows for identification of biomarker candidates in multi-dimensional MALDI-TOF MS profiling studies with complex experimental design. With respect to feature selection our method provides a fast and intuitive alternative to global optimization strategies with comparable performance.

Combining EWAS with deep molecular phenotyping, such as approaches enabled by metabolomics and proteomics, allows further probing of the underlying disease-associated pathways. For instance, methylation of the TXNIP gene is associated robustly with prevalent type 2 diabetes and further with metabolites that are short-term markers of glycaemic control. These associations reflect TXNIP's function as a glucose uptake regulator by interaction with the major glucose transporter GLUT1 and suggest that TXNIP methylation can be used as a read-out for the organism's exposure to glucose stress. Another case is the association between DNA methylation of the AHRR and F2RL3 genes with smoking and a protein that is involved in the reprogramming of the bronchial epithelium. These examples show that associations between DNA methylation and intermediate molecular traits can open new windows into how the body copes with physiological challenges. This knowledge, if carefully interpreted, may indicate novel therapy options and, together with monitoring of the methylation state of specific methylation sites, may in the future allow the early diagnosis of impending disease. It is essential for medical practitioners to recognize the potential that this field holds in translating basic research findings to clinical practice. In this review, we present recent advances in the field of EWAS with metabolomics and proteomics and discuss both the potential and the challenges of translating epigenetic associations, with deep molecular phenotypes, to biomedical applications.;;"Qatar Foundation (QF); Weill Cornell Medical College Qatar; Cornell University; Weill Cornell Medicine";;;;;;;;;;9;11;;;;;;;;;;;SEP;2021;290;3;;;;;527;548;;10.1111/joim.13306;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joim.13306;;MAY 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000652834100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are a population with a worse prognosis and higher mortality risk compared to coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. However, the value of ceramides for risk prediction in PAD patients is still vague, as addressed in the present study. (2)Methods: This observational study included 379 PAD patients. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 10 years of follow-up. A set of ceramides was measured by LC-MS/MS and combined according to the Coronary Event Risk Test (CERT) score, which categorizes patients into one of four risk groups (low risk, moderate risk, high risk, very high risk). (3) Results: Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that the overall survival of patients decreased with the increasing risk predicted by the four CERT categories, advancing from low risk to very high risk. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that each one-category increase resulted in a 35% rise in overall mortality risk (HR = 1.35 [1.16-1.58]). Multivariable adjustment, including, among others, age, LDL-cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, and statin treatment before the baseline, did not abrogate this significant association (HR = 1.22 [1.04-1.43]). Moreover, we found that the beneficial effect of statin treatment is significantly stronger in patients with a higher risk, according to CERT. (4) Conclusions: We conclude that the ceramide-based risk score CERT is a strong predictor of the 10-year mortality risk in patients with PAD.;;"Tampere University; Drexel University";;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2023;12;19;;;;;;;6151;10.3390/jcm12196151;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm12196151;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001119426200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

We aimed to synthesise existing evidence on the observational and genetic associations between circulating proteins and CMD. Methods PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched until July 2023 for potentially relevant prospective observational and Mendelian randomisation (MR) studies investigating associations between circulating proteins and CMD, including coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and atherosclerosis. Two investigators independently extracted study characteristics using a standard form and pooled data using random effects models. Results 50 observational, 25 MR and 10 studies performing both analyses were included, involving 26414160 non-overlapping participants. Meta-analysis of observational studies revealed 560 proteins associated with CMD, of which 133 proteins were associated with >= 2 CMDs (ie, pleiotropic). There were 245 potentially causal protein biomarkers identified in MR pooled results, involving 23 pleiotropic proteins. IL6RA and MMP12 were each causally associated with seven diseases. 22 protein-disease pairs showed directionally concordant associations in observational and MR pooled estimates. Addition of protein biomarkers to traditional clinical models modestly improved the accuracy of predicting incident CMD, with the highest improvement for heart failure (Delta C-index 0.2). Of the 245 potentially causal proteins (291 protein-disease pairs), 3 pairs were validated by evidence of drug development from existing drug databases, 288 pairs lacked evidence of drug development and 66 proteins were drug targets approved for other indications. Conclusions Combined analyses of observational and genetic studies revealed the potential causal role of several proteins in the aetiology of CMD. Novel protein biomarkers are promising targets for drug development and risk stratification.

Bariatric/metabolic surgeries, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), provide an avenue for exploring the potential key factors involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis since these surgeries have shown promising results in improving glycemic control among patients with severe type 2 diabetes (T2D). For the first time, a markedly altered population of serum proteins in patients after LSG was discovered and analyzed through proteomics. Apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) was revealed to be increased dramatically in diabetic obese patients following LSG, and a similar effect was observed in patients after RYGB surgery. Moreover, recombinant apoA-IV protein treatment was proven to enhance insulin secretion in isolated human islets. These results showed that apoA-IV may play a crucial role in glycemic control in humans, potentially through enhancing insulin secretion in human islets. ApoA-IV was further shown to enhance energy expenditure and improve glucose tolerance in diabetic rodents, through stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells, partially via G alpha s-coupled GPCR/cAMP (G protein-coupled receptor/cyclic adenosine monophosphate) signaling. Furthermore, T55-121, truncated peptide 55-121 of apoA-IV, was discovered to mediate the function of apoA-IV.

Unfortunately, however, the biological roles of most of these enzymes remain poorly defined, since the physiological substrates are typically unknown and are difficult to identify using traditional methods. We have developed a proteomics experiment based on FTMS profiling and differential mass spectrometry (dMS) to identify candidate endogenous substrates of proteases using fractionated human plasma as the candidate substrate pool. Here we report proof-of-concept experiments for identifying in vitro substrates of antinopeptidase P2, (APP2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), a peptidase of therapeutic interest for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. For both proteases, previously validated peptide substrates spiked into the human plasma pool were identified. Of note, the differential mass spectrometry experiments also identified novel substrates for each peptidase in the subfraction of human plasma. Targeted MS/MS analysis of these peptides in the complex human plasma pool and manual confirmation of the amino acid sequences led to the identification of these substrates. The novel DPP-4 substrate EPLGRQLTSGP was chemically synthesized and cleavage kinetics were determined in an in vitro DPP-4 enzyme assay. The apparent second order rate constant (k(cat)/K-M) for DPP-4-mediated cleavage was determined to be 2.3 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) confirming that this peptide is efficiently processed by the peptidase in vitro. Collectively, these results demonstrate that differential mass spectrometry has the potential to identify candidate endogenous substrates of target proteases from a human plasma pool. Importantly, knowledge of the endogenous substrates can provide useful insight into the biology of these enzymes and provides useful biomarkers for monitoring their activity in vivo.

This study used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationship between 7156 plasma proteins and CLL risk.MethodsA two-sample MR analysis assessed the impact of specific plasma proteins on CLL risk, using data from the Finngen Proteomics project (analyzing 828 participants) and the UK Biobank. Additional analyses included colocalization, phenomenon-wide MR, and protein-protein interaction networks.ResultsThe study identified nine plasma proteins significantly associated with CLL risk. Increased levels of Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase E (PPIE) (OR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.22-2.27, P = 0.001) were associated with an increased risk of developing CLL, whereas Protein O-Mannosyltransferase 2 (POMGNT2) (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.91, P = 0.017) and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 14(CCL14) (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.67-0.94, P = 0.010) were associated with a reduced risk of CLL. Colocalization analysis suggested that PPIE may share pathogenic variants with CLL (PP.H4 = 0.758). Phenomenon-wide MR analysis of PPIE also indicated associations with other clinical features, including rheumatic diseases and type 2 diabetes. Protein-protein interaction and drug-gene interaction analyses highlighted CDC5L and SNW1 as potential therapeutic targets.ConclusionThis study identifies nine plasma proteins linked to CLL risk, with PPIE offering new insights into the disease's pathogenesis. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore their potential as therapeutic targets.;;Ningbo University;;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;JAN 3;2025;16;1;;;;;;;2;10.1007/s12672-024-01699-2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12672-024-01699-2;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001389247600002;View Full Record in Web of Science

We evaluated aspects of sample preparation to allow liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of more than 1500 samples from the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial of adults with type 2 diabetes. MethodsUsing LC-MS with data-independent acquisition we evaluated four variables: plasma protein depletion, EDTA or citrated anti-coagulant blood collection tubes, plasma lipid depletion strategies and plasma freeze-thaw cycles. Optimised methods were applied in a pilot study of FIELD participants. ResultsLC-MS of undepleted plasma conducted over a 45 min gradient yielded 172 proteins after excluding immunoglobulin isoforms. Cibachrome-blue-based depletion yielded additional proteins but with cost and time expenses, while immunodepleting albumin and IgG provided few additional identifications. Only minor variations were associated with blood collection tube type, delipidation methods and freeze-thaw cycles. From 65 batches involving over 1500 injections, the median intra-batch quantitative differences in the top 100 proteins of the plasma external standard were less than 2%. Fenofibrate altered seven plasma proteins.

The diagnosis of T2D is commonly based on plasma glucose levels, and there are no reliable clinical biomarkers available for early detection. Recent advances in proteome technologies offer new opportunity for the understanding of T2D; however, the underlying proteomic characteristics of T2D have not been thoroughly investigated yet. Here, using proteomic and glycoproteomic profiling, we provided a comprehensive landscape of molecular alterations in the fasting plasma of the 24 Chinese participants, including eight T2D patients, eight prediabetic (PDB) subjects, and eight healthy control (HC) individuals. Our analyses identified a diverse set of potential biomarkers that might enhance the efficiency and accuracy based on current existing biological indicators of (pre)diabetes. Through integrative omics analysis, we showed the capability of glycoproteomics as a complement to proteomics or metabolomics, to provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of (pre)diabetes. We have newly identified systemic site-specific N-glycosylation alterations underlying T2D patients in the complement activation pathways, including decreased levels of N-glycopeptides from C1s, MASP1, and CFP proteins, and increased levels of N-glycopeptides from C2, C4, C4BPA, C4BPB, and CFH. These alterations were not observed at proteomic levels, suggesting new opportunities for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Our results demonstrate a great potential role of glycoproteomics in understanding (pre)diabetes and present a new direction for diabetes research which deserves more attention.";;"National Institute of Metrology China; Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Capital Medical University; Capital Medical University";;;;;;;;;;9;12;;;;;;;;;;;JUN 11;2021;9;;;;;;;;677621;10.3389/fchem.2021.677621;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2021.677621;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000665761000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we assessed the tear fluid of nondiabetic individuals, diabetic patients with no DR, and diabetic patients with nonproliferative DR (NPDR) or with proliferative DR (PDR) to find putative biomarkers for the diagnosis and staging of DR. MethodsTear fluid samples were collected using Schirmer test strips from a cohort with 12 controls and 54 Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) patients, and then analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS)-based shotgun proteomics and bead-based multiplex assay. Tear fluid-derived small extracellular vesicles (EVs) were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, Western Blotting, and nano tracking. ResultsProteomics analysis revealed that among the 682 reliably quantified proteins in tear fluid, 42 and 26 were differentially expressed in NPDR and PDR, respectively, comparing to the control group. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD033101. By multicomparison analyses, we also found significant changes in 32 proteins. Gene ontology (GO) annotations showed that most of these proteins are associated with oxidative stress and small EVs. Indeed, we also found that tear fluid is particularly enriched in small EVs. T2D patients with NPDR have higher IL-2/-5/-18, TNF, MMP-2/-3/-9 concentrations than the controls. In the PDR group, IL-5/-18 and MMP-3/-9 concentrations were significantly higher, whereas IL-13 was lower, compared to the controls. ConclusionsOverall, the results show alterations in tear fluid proteins profile in diabetic patients with retinopathy.

However, there is still epidemic vitamin D insufficiency especially among individuals living at high latitudes or with dark skin. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) are considered the best biomarker of vitamin D nutritional status. Appropriate Sunshine exposure or oral supplementation is necessary to maintain sufficient vitamin D status, which is generally accepted as serum 25(OH)D > 75 nmol/l. Immunoassays, especially RIA, have been primarily used to measure serum 25(OH)D while liquid chromatography-MS (LC-MS) is considered the 'gold standard'. There is significant disparity among the immunoassays, and all immunoassays have considerable bias compared with LC-MS methods. Because of the variations among the results from these different assays, it is necessary that assay-specific reference ranges be established or standardisation of the assays take place. The present review focuses on ecological, case-control, and cohort studies that investigated the role of vitamin D in health and disease. In addition, analytical techniques used in laboratory evaluation of vitamin D nutritional status are also critically reviewed.

Erythritol is of medical interest because elevated plasma levels of this polyol are predictive for visceral adiposity gain and development of type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms behind these associations remain unknown because the erythritol biosynthesis pathway, particularly the enzyme catalyzing the final step of erythritol synthesis (reduction of erythrose to erythritol), is not characterized. In this study, we purified two enzymes from rabbit liver capable of catalyzing the conversion of erythrose to erythritol: alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD). Both recombinant human ADH1 and SORD reduce erythrose to erythritol, using NADPH as a co-factor, and cell culture studies indicate that this activity is primarily NADPH-dependent. We found that ADH1 variants vary markedly in both their affinity for erythrose and their catalytic capacity (turnover number). Interestingly, the recombinant protein produced from the ADH1B2 variant, common in Asian populations, is not active when NADPH is used as a co-factor in vitro. We also confirmed SORD contributes to intracellular erythritol production in human A549 lung cancer cells, where ADH1 is minimally expressed. In summary, human ADH1 and SORD catalyze the conversion of erythrose to erythritol, pointing to novel roles for two dehydrogenase proteins in human glucose metabolism that may contribute to individual responses to diet.

They have been used in the diagnosis of several metabolic diseases. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is the most frequently used NAGlys detection platform. Here, we describe a simple and sensitive method of NAGlys detection by LC-MS in plasma and urine samples. This approach is based on the use of a derivatization reagent, 3-nitrophenylhydrazine. The reaction is quick in aqueous solution, and no quenching step is needed. To expand the coverage of NAGlys when standards are not available, NAGlys were first identified based on high-resolution LC-MS. Quantification was subsequently carried out on triple quadrupole LC-MS. This approach allowed a much broader measurement of NAGlys (41 NAGlys in total), especially when authentic standards are unavailable. Comprehensive analysis of NAGlys with this new method was applied in plasma and urine samples of db/db diabetic and non-diabetic db/m+ control mice. The majority of detected NAGlys were altered with high differentiation ability in plasma and urine samples from diabetic and non-diabetic mice. These identified NAGlys hold the potential to be diagnostic biomarkers for type II diabetes and diabetic complications.;;"Hong Kong Baptist University; City University of Hong Kong";;;;;;;;;;8;9;;;;;;;;;;;JAN 31;2023;95;4;;;;;2183;2191;;10.1021/acs.analchem.2c02507;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c02507;;JAN 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000924177200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The 2-DE analysis demonstrated that 92 spots from about 900 visualized spots were differentially regulated, of which 40 spots were identified as principal diabetes-associated proteins.

Two proteomic multiplex platforms were employed for this purpose. Metods: An immunofluorescent multiplex platform and an aptamer-based method were used to evaluate 32 protein analytes from 153 individuals with moderate to severe major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HCs). The study focused on determining the level of agreement between the two platforms and evaluating the ability of individual analytes and principal components (PCs) to differentiate between the MDD and HC groups. Additionally, the study investigated the relationship between PCs consisting of chemokines and cytokines and comorbid inflammatory and cardiometabolic diseases. Findings: Analysis revealed a small or moderate correlation between 47% of the analytes measured by the two platforms. Two proteomic profiles were identified that differentiated individuals with moderate to severe MDD from HCs. High eotaxin, age, BMI, IP-10, or IL -10 characterized profile 1. This profile was associated with several cardiometabolic risk factors, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Profile 2 is characterized by higher age, BMI, interleukins, and a strong negative loading for eotaxin. This profile was associated with inflammation but not cardiometabolic risk factors. Conclusion: This study provides further evidence that proteomic profiles can be used to identify potential biomarkers and pathways associated with MDD and comorbidities. Our findings suggest that MDD is associated with distinct profiles of proteins that are also associated with cardiometabolic risk factors, inflammation, and obesity. In particular, the chemokines eotaxin and IP-10 appear to play a role in the relationship between MDD and cardiometabolic risk factors. These findings suggest that a focus on the interplay between MDD and comorbidities may be useful in identifying potential targets for intervention and improving overall health outcomes.;;"Stanford University; University of California System; University of California Irvine";;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2024;36;;;;;;;;100731;10.1016/j.bbih.2024.100731;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2024.100731;;FEB 2024;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001202819100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

We recently developed and validated a straightforward metabolite-based test for the assessment of IR and IGT in a single LC-MS/MS method. Plasma samples were diluted with isotopically-labeled internal standards and extracted by simple protein precipitation. The extracts were analyzed by LC-MS/MS for the quantitation of 2-hydroxybutyric acid (0.500-40.0 mu g/mL), 3-hydroxybutyric acid (1.00-80.0 mu g/mL), 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid (0.500-20.0 mu g/mL), 1-linoleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (2.50-100 mu g/mL),oleic acid (10.0-400 mu g/mL), pantothenic acid (0.0100-0.800 mu g/mL), and serine (2.50-100 mu g/mL). Liquid chromatography was carried out on a reversed phase column with a run time of 3.1 min and the mass spectrometer operated in negative MRM mode. Method validation was performed on three identical LC-MS/MS systems with five runs each. Sufficient linearity (R-2 > 0.99) was observed for all the analytes over the ranges. The imprecision (CVs) was found to be less than 5.5% for intra-run and less than 5.8% for inter-run for the seven analytes.

For diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy (DN), urinary proteome analysis was successfully applied in a pilot study. The validity of the previously established proteomic biomarkers with respect to the diagnostic and prognostic potential was assessed on a separate set of patients recruited at three different European centers. In this case-control study of 148 Caucasian patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and duration >= 5 years, cases of DN were defined as albuminuria >300 mg/d and diabetic retinopathy (n = 66). Controls were matched for gender and diabetes duration (n = 82). Methodology/Principal Findings: Proteome analysis was performed blinded using high-resolution capillary electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry (CE-MS). Data were evaluated employing the previously developed model for DN. Upon unblinding, the model for DN showed 93.8% sensitivity and 91.4% specificity, with an AUC of 0.948 (95% CI 0.898-0.978). Of 65 previously identified peptides, 60 were significantly different between cases and controls of this study. In <10% of cases and controls classification by proteome analysis not entirely resulted in the expected clinical outcome. Analysis of patient's subsequent clinical course revealed later progression to DN in some of the false positive classified DN control patients. Conclusions: These data provide the first independent confirmation that profiling of the urinary proteome by CE-MS can adequately identify subjects with DN, supporting the generalizability of this approach. The data further establish urinary collagen fragments as biomarkers for diabetes-induced renal damage that may serve as earlier and more specific biomarkers than the currently used urinary albumin.;;"University of Groningen; Isala Clinics; Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH (MOS); Charles University Prague; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Graz; University of Glasgow; Medical University of Graz; Steno Diabetes Center; Charles University Prague; Medical University of Graz; Medical University of Graz";;;;;;;;;;111;117;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 20;2010;5;10;;;;;;;e13421;10.1371/journal.pone.0013421;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013421;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000283216400005;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we used our own established LC-MS/MS method to examine the plasma BH4 levels in diabetes to determine whether it could be used as a biomarker for the prediction of kidney injury in those patients. Methods: Hospitalized diabetes patients in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan to Aug 2021 were recruited. To assess the association between plasma BH4 with ACR or eGFR in diabetes, a total of 142 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) were enrolled. They were divided into three groups by albuminuria levels: normoalbuminuria (n = 68), microalbuminuria (n = 48), and macroalbuminuria (n = 26) according to ACR; or into two groups by eGFR: eGFR 0.001) and CP-2h (B = -0.257, P = 0.028) were independently associated with ACR progression. ROC curve showed that BH4 level has a predictive value on ACR (95%CI 0.686-0.841, sensitivity 69.1%, specificity 73%). Moreover, in diabetes patients with eGFR 90 ml/min, plasma BH4 level (P = 0.008) is higher than those in diabetes with eGFR<90 ml/min and BH4 was remained independently associated with eGFR after multivariable logistic regression analysis (B = -0.193, P = 0.048).

However, it is important to understand that long-term usage of medicines like metformin and other diabetic treatments can result in problems, gastrointestinal discomfort, and dysbiosis of the gut flora. Advanced sequencing technologies have improved our understanding of the gut microbiome's role in diabetes, uncovering complex interactions between microbial composition and metabolic health. We explore how the gut microbiota affects glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity by examining a variety of-omics data, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics. Machine learning algorithms and genome-scale modeling are now being applied to find microbiological biomarkers associated with diabetes risk, predicted disease progression, and guide customized therapy. This study holds promise for specialized diabetic therapy. Despite significant advances, some concerns remain unanswered, including understanding the complex relationship between diabetes etiology and gut microbiota, as well as developing user-friendly technological innovations. This mini-review explores the relationship between multiomics, precision medicine, and machine learning to improve our understanding of the gut microbiome's function in diabetes.

For example, it is important to identify significant genetic pathway effects associated with biomarkers in which a gene pathway is a set of genes that functionally works together to regulate a certain biological process. A pathway-based analysis can detect a subtle change in expression level that cannot be found using a gene-based analysis. Here, we refer to pathway as a set and gene as an element in a set. However, it is challenging to select automatically which pathways are highly associated to the outcome when there are multiple pathways. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric multikernel regression model to study the effects of fixed covariates (e.g., clinical variables) and sets of elements (e.g., pathways of genes) to address a problem of detecting signal sets associated to biomarkers. We model the unknown high-dimension functions of multi-sets via multiple Gaussian kernel machines to consider the possibility that elements within the same set interact with each other. Hence, our variable set selection can be considered a Gaussian process set selection. We develop our Gaussian process set selection under the Bayesian variance component-selection framework. We incorporate prior knowledge for structural sets by imposing an Ising prior on the model. Our approach can be easily applied in high-dimensional spaces where the sample size is smaller than the number of variables. An efficient variational Bayes algorithm is developed. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach through simulation studies and through a type II diabetes genetic-pathway analysis.;;Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University;;;;;;;;;;0;0;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2024;17;3;;;;;;;e11699;10.1002/sam.11699;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sam.11699;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001239839900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are common glucose-lowering drugs in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Among these, linagliptin has been suggested to exert kidney protective effects. It is investigated whether an effect of linagliptin on kidney function could be unmasked by characterizing the urinary proteome profile (UPP) in albuminuric T2D individuals. Experimental design Participants of the MARLINA-T2D trial (NCT01792518) are randomized 1:1 to receive either linagliptin 5 mg or placebo for 24 weeks. A previously developed proteome-based classifier, CKD273, is assessed. Results Results confirm a significant correlation between CKD273 and clinical kidney parameters as well as with eGFR decline. Patient stratification using CKD273 at baseline, show a trend toward attenuation of renal function loss in high CKD-risk patients treated with linagliptin. Moreover, characterized are linagliptin affected peptides of which the majority contained a DPP-4 target sequence. Conclusions and clinical relevance CKD273 is a promising tool for identifying patients at high risk for CKD progression and may unmask a potential of linagliptin to slow progressive kidney function loss in high CKD-risk patients.

To obtain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PTDM development and early glomerular damage before the development of histologically visible diabetic kidney disease, we comparatively analysed the proteome of histologically normal glomeruli from patients with PTDM and normoglycaemic (NG) transplant recipients. Moreover, to assess specificities inherent in PTDM, we also comparatively evaluated glomerular proteomes from transplant recipients with preexisting type 2 DM (T2DM).MethodsProtocol biopsies were obtained from adult NG, PTDM and T2DM patients one year after kidney transplantation. Biopsies were formalin-fixed and embedded in paraffin, and glomerular cross-sections were microdissected. A total of 4 NG, 7 PTDM and 6 T2DM kidney biopsies were used for the analysis. The proteome was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Relative differences in protein abundance and significantly dysregulated pathways were analysed.ResultsProteins involved in cell adhesion, immune response, leukocyte transendothelial filtration, and cell localization and organization were less abundant in glomeruli from PTDM patients than in those from NG patients, and proteins associated with supramolecular fibre organization and protein-containing complex binding were more abundant in PTDM patients. Overall, proteins related to adherens and tight junctions and those related to the immune system, including leukocyte transendothelial migration, were more abundant in NG patients than in transplanted patients with DM, irrespective of the timing of its development. However, proteins included in cell-cell junctions and adhesion, insulin resistance, and vesicle-mediated transport were all less abundant in PTDM patients than in T2DM patients.ConclusionsThe glomerular proteome profile differentiates PTDM from NG and T2DM, suggesting specific pathogenetic mechanisms. Further studies are warranted to validate these results, potentially leading to an improved understanding of PTDM kidney transplant pathophysiology and to the identification of novel biomarkers.;;"University of Bergen; University of Bergen; Haukeland University Hospital; Comenius University Bratislava; University of Bergen; Haukeland University Hospital; University of Oslo; University of Oslo; UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; University of Oslo; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Farmacologia Traslazionale (IFT-CNR)";;;;;;;;;;1;2;;;;;;;;;;;AUG 25;2023;24;1;;;;;;;254;10.1186/s12882-023-03294-z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12882-023-03294-z;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001054500000002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Epidemiological and intervention studies suggest that they can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This review addresses their metabolic handling after oral consumption to provide a mechanistic basis to explain their possible effects on health. Intact acyl-quinic acids are absorbed only to a small extent in the small intestine, but the cinnamic acids are efficiently absorbed after hydrolysis by either digestive or microbial enzymes in the colon. Metabolism results in phenolic conjugates in the blood and urine, but varying dependent on the acyl-quinic acid, and subject to significant interperson variability. The balance between hydrogenation and complete beta-oxidation of the cinnamic acids, both by liver and gut microbiota, determines the profile of metabolites. Pharmacokinetic data suggest that some metabolites are bound to human serum albumin and/or sequestered in tissues, and some exhibit biological activity in vitro, consistent with proposed protective action in vivo. Significant gaps in the literature include lack of plasma and urinary data for free-living individuals, and pharmacokinetic data for groups who consume coffee or mate at regular short intervals. Data are required for cis isomers. There is a critical need for precise urinary biomarkers of consumption of acyl-quinic acids, accounting for variability in individual metabolism and in beverage composition, thus facilitating better translation of urinary metabolite measurements into accurate coffee consumption data to improve the outcomes of future epidemiological and intervention studies.;;"University of Surrey; Monash University";;;;;;;;;;112;121;;;;;;;;;;;JUL;2020;19;4;;;;;1299;1352;;10.1111/1541-4337.12518;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.12518;;JAN 2020;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000505288700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This work aims to describe differences between younger (<65 years) and older (>= 65 years) pre-frail and frail HF outpatients regarding their nutritional, functional and clinical statuses.Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a sample of 99 HF frail and pre-frail patients (aged 24-81 years, 38.4% women, 21.2% frail, 59.6% <65 years) was recruited from an HF outpatients' clinic in northern Portugal. Muscle mass was estimated from mid-upper arm muscle circumference. Weight status was assessed using body mass index. Hand grip strength and gait speed were measured. Medical records were reviewed. Associations between participants' characteristics and age were calculated using binary logistic regression.Results: Age was associated with hand grip strength (OR=0.90), gait speed (OR=0.01) and dia-betes (OR=4.95). Obesity, muscle mass or heart failure functional classes were not associated with age categories.Conclusion: There is an overall lack of differentiation between younger and older HF patients with the frailty phenotype. Therefore, frailty phenotype should be assessed in all patients, regardless of age. Hand grip strength seems to be a good predictor for older age and more studies are needed to define age-specific hand grip strength cut-offs for HF populations.

Nicotine is the major alkaloid present in tobacco smoke, and many of the negative effects of smoking are attributed to nicotine. Nicotine is not only the addictive component of tobacco smoke, but also highly associated with carcinogenesis and induces oxidative stress. Furthermore, the administration of nicotine via subcutaneous mini-osmotic pumps or by injection is an established method in preclinical studies for this area of research. Thus, preclinical research on the negative effects of tobacco smoke and tobacco addiction has focused primarily on the effects of nicotine. However, there are over 4,500 components found in tobacco smoke, many of which are highly toxic. Other components may also contribute to the addictive properties of tobacco smoke. Furthermore, the negative effects of tobacco smoke are not isolated to the smoker but can have negative effects to those exposed to the secondhand smoke (SHS) stream. SHS exposure is the third leading cause of preventable death. Approximately 38,000 deaths per year are attributed to SHS exposure in the USA. SHS exposure increases the risk of heart disease by approximately 30% and is associated with increased risk of stroke, cancer, type II diabetes, as well as pulmonary disease. Thus, methods of administering tobacco smoke in a controlled environment will further our understanding of tobacco addiction and the role tobacco smoke in other disease states. Moreover, combining smoke exposure with proteomics can lead to the discovery of biomarkers that can be potentially useful tools in screening, early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases caused by SHS.;;"State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida";;;;;;;;;;5;6;;;;;;;;;;;;2012;829;;;;;;329;348;;10.1007/978-1-61779-458-2_22;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-61779-458-2_22;10.1007/978-1-61779-458-2;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000321877300024;View Full Record in Web of Science

They are considered to be an informative resource for the non-invasive study of molecular events in health and disease as they carry a variety of molecular constituents from their cells of origin, such as lipids, proteins and RNAs. For early stages of biomarker discovery schemes, untargeted omics-based approaches, which preferably employs uEVs isolated from pooled urine samples, may suit better. However, targeted approaches that preferably uses uEV isolated from individual urine samples are preferred for validation and clinical translation. The volume of urine needed for downstream analytical purposes and the sampling method (i.e. pooled vs. individual samples) are important practical aspects which need to be taken into consideration along with the challenges associated with the different methods of uEVs isolation. Here we provide an overview of the various isolation methods with special focus on the initial sample volumes as well as the sampling method applied. Our original data on the isolation of uEVs by employing salt precipitation and the sucrose/D2O double cushion ultracentrifugation method is also presented along with the latest trends over the last three years on their clinical applications. In this work, we demonstrate the performance and the reproducibility of the method using small volumes of individual and pooled samples as well as samples of a small group of patients with type 2 diabetes.

However, glucose can also react with primary amino groups present in other cellular components, such as aminophospholipids (aminoPLs). Although it is proposed that glycated aminoPLs can induce many cellular responses and contribute to the development and progression of diabetes, the routes of their formation and their biological roles are only partially revealed. The same is true for the influence of glucose-derived modifications on the biophysical properties of PLs. Here we studied structural, signaling, and biophysical properties of glycated and glycoxidized phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). By combining high resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy it was possible to deduce the structures of several intermediates indicating an oxidative cleavage of the Amadori product yielding glycoxidized PEs including advanced glycation end products, such as carboxyethyl- and carboxymethylethanolamines. The pro-oxidative role of glycated PEs was demonstrated and further associated with several cellular responses including activation of NIFKB signaling pathways. Label free proteomics indicated significant alterations in proteins regulating cellular metabolisms. Finally, the biophysical properties of PL membranes changed significantly upon PE glycation, such as melting temperature (Tn,), membrane surface charge, and ion transport across the phospholipid bilayer.

The aim of this study was to identify novel therapeutic target molecules that play a role in the tubule damage of DN. We used an LC-MS/MS-based proteomic technique and human renal proximal epithelial cells (HRPTECs). Urine samples from Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 46) were used to quantify the candidate protein. Several proteins in HRPTECs in cultured media were observed to be driven by TGF-beta 1, one of which was 33-kDa IGFBP7, which is a member of IGFBP family. TGF-beta 1 up-regulated the expressions of IGFBP7 mRNA and protein in a dose-and time-dependent fashion via Smad2 and 4, but not MAPK pathways in HRPTECs. In addition, the knockdown of IGFBP7 restored the TGF-beta 1-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In the immunohistochemical analysis, IGFBP7 was localized to the cytoplasm of tubular cells but not that of glomerular cells in diabetic kidney. Urinary IGFBP7 levels were significantly higher in the patients with macroalbuminuria and were correlated with age (r = 0.308, p = 0.037), eGFR (r = -0.376, p = 0.01), urinary beta(2)-microglobulin (r = 0.385, p = 0.008), and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) (r = 0.502, p = 0.000). A multivariate regression analysis identified urinary NAG and age as determinants associated with urinary IGFBP7 levels. In conclusion, our data suggest that TGF-beta 1 enhances IGFBP7 via Smad2/4 pathways, and that IGFBP7 might be involved in the TGF-beta 1-induced tubular injury in DN.;;"Asahikawa Medical College; Asahikawa Medical College";;;;;;;;;;36;38;;;;;;;;;;;MAR 14;2016;11;3;;;;;;;e0150897;10.1371/journal.pone.0150897;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0150897;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000372570600038;View Full Record in Web of Science

Proteome analysis holds the promise of delivering insight into the pathophysiological changes associated with diabetes. Recently, we identified and validated urinary proteomics biomarkers for diabetes. Based on these initial findings, we aimed to further validate urinary proteomics biomarkers specific for diabetes in general, and particularity associated with either type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methodology/Principal Findings: Therefore, the low-molecular-weight urinary proteome of 902 subjects from 10 different centers, 315 controls and 587 patients with T1D (n = 299) or T2D (n = 288), was analyzed using capillary-electrophoresis mass-spectrometry. The 261 urinary biomarkers (100 were sequenced) previously discovered in 205 subjects were validated in an additional 697 subjects to distinguish DM subjects (n = 382) from control subjects (n = 315) with 94% (95% CI: 92-95) accuracy in this study. To identify biomarkers that differentiate T1D from T2D, a subset of normoalbuminuric patients with T1D (n = 68) and T2D (n = 42) was employed, enabling identification of 131 biomarker candidates (40 were sequenced) differentially regulated between T1D and T2D. These biomarkers distinguished T1D from T2D in an independent validation set of normoalbuminuric patients (n = 108) with 88% (95% CI: 81-94%) accuracy, and in patients with impaired renal function (n = 369) with 85% (95% CI: 81-88%) accuracy. Specific collagen fragments were associated with diabetes and type of diabetes indicating changes in collagen turnover and extracellular matrix as one hallmark of the molecular pathophysiology of diabetes. Additional biomarkers including inflammatory processes and pro-thrombotic alterations were observed. Conclusions/Significance: These findings, based on the largest proteomic study performed to date on subjects with DM, validate the previously described biomarkers for DM, and pinpoint differences in the urinary proteome of T1D and T2D, indicating significant differences in extracellular matrix remodeling.;;"Children's Hospital Colorado; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) Solutions; Charles University Prague; University of Glasgow; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center for Infection Research; University of Melbourne; University of Groningen; Medical University of Graz; Steno Diabetes Center; Charles University Prague; University of Erlangen Nuremberg; Medical University of Graz; University of Graz";;;;;;;;;;44;45;;;;;;;;;;;SEP 28;2010;5;9;;;;;;;e13051;10.1371/journal.pone.0013051;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013051;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000282210700021;View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective: To assess the total serum vitamin D response to vitamin D-3 supplementation and whether it varies according to participant characteristics. To compare results with corresponding results for total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], which is used clinically and measured in supplementation trials. Design: Exploratory study within a randomized trial. Intervention: 2000 International Units of vitamin D-3 per day (or matching placebo). Setting: Community-based. Participants: 161 adults (mean +/- SD age 70 +/- 6 years; 66% males) with type 2 diabetes. Main Outcome Measures: Changes in total serum vitamin D and total serum 25(OH)D concentrations from baseline to year 2. Results: At baseline, there was a positive, nonlinear relation between total serum vitamin D and total serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Adjusted effects of supplementation were a 29.2 (95% CI: 24.3, 34.1) nmol/L increase in serum vitamin D and a 33.4 (95% CI: 27.7, 39.2) nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH)D. Among those with baseline 25(OH)D < 50 compared with >= 50 nmol/L, the serum vitamin D response to supplementation was attenuated (15.7 vs 31.2 nmol/L; interaction P-value = 0.02), whereas the serum 25(OH)D response was augmented (47.9 vs 30.7 nmol/L; interaction P-value = 0.05). Conclusions: Vitamin D-3 supplementation increases total serum vitamin D and 25(OH) D concentrations with variation according to baseline 25(OH)D, which suggests that 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D-3 is more efficient when serum 25(OH)D concentration is low.";;"University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard University Medical Affiliates; Brigham & Women's Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

While previous studies used antibody-based methods to quantify AGEs, data from tandem mass spectrometry coupled liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS)-based measurements are limited to patients with known diabetes. Here, we used the LC-MS/MSmethod to test the hypothesis that plasma AGE levels are higher in individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) than in those with normal fasting glucose (NFG). Secondary aims were to assess correlations of plasma AGEs with quantitative markers of glucose metabolism and biomarkers of subclinical inflammation. This study included on 60 women with NFG or IFG (n = 30 each, mean age 74 years) from the German SALIA cohort. Plasma levels of free metabolites (3-deoxyfructose, 3-deoxypentosone, 3-deoxypentulose), two hydroimidazolones, oxidised adducts (carboxymethyllysine, carboxyethyllysine, methionine sulfoxide) and Ne-fructosyllysine were measured using LC-MS/MS. Plasma concentrations of all tested AGEs did not differ between the NFG and IFG groups (all p>0.05). Associations between plasma levels of AGEs and fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR as a measure of insulin resistance were weak (r between -0.2 and 0.2, all p>0.05). The association between 3-deoxyglucosone-derived hydroimidazolone with several proinflammatory biomarkers disappeared upon adjustment for multiple testing. In conclusion, plasma AGEs assessed by LC-MS/MS were neither increased in IFG nor associated with parameters of glucosemetabolism and subclinical inflammation in our study.

In this study, we analyzed the fasting NEFA profiles of normoglycemic individuals at risk for T2D (women with a recent history of gestational diabetes (GDM)) in comparison to controls (women after a normoglycemic pregnancy). We also examined the associations of NEFA species with overweight/obesity, body fat distribution and insulin sensitivity. Subjects and Methods Using LC-MS/MS, we analyzed 41 NEFA species in the fasting sera of 111 women (62 post-GDM, 49 controls). Clinical characterization included a five-point oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), biomarkers and anthropometrics, magnetic resonance imaging (n = 62) and a food frequency questionnaire. Nonparametric tests with Bonferroni correction, binary logistic regression analyses and rank correlations were used for statistical analysis. Results Women after GDM had a lower molar percentage of total saturated fatty acids (SFA; 38.55% vs. 40.32%, p = 0.0002) than controls. At an explorative level of significance several NEFA species were associated with post-GDM status (with and without adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and HbA1c): The molar percentages of 14: 0, 16: 0, 18: 0 and 18: 4 were reduced, whereas those of 18: 1, 18: 2, 20: 2, 24: 4, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and total n-6 NEFA were increased. BMI and the amount of body fat correlated inversely with several SFA and MUFA and positively with various PUFA species over the whole study cohort (abs(rho)>= 0.3 for all). 14: 0 was inversely and BMI-independently associated with abdominal visceral adiposity. We saw no correlations of NEFA species with insulin sensitivity and the total NEFA concentration was similar in the post-GDM and the control group. Conclusion In conclusion, we found alterations in the fasting NEFA profile associated with a recent history of gestational diabetes, a risk marker for T2D.

Although the beneficial effects of SGLT2i have been demonstrated, their target mechanisms on kidney function are unknown. The current study aimed to elucidate these mechanisms by studying SGLT2i-induced changes in the urinary proteome of persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and DKD. Methods: A total of 40 participants with T2D were enrolled in a double -blinded randomized cross -over trial at the Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Denmark. They were treated with 10 mg of dapagliflozin for 12 weeks. Thirty-two participants with complete urinary proteomics measures before and after the trial were included. All participants received renin-angiotensin system blockade and had albuminuria, (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] >= 30 mg/g). A type 1 diabetes (T1D) cohort consisting of healthy controls and persons with DKD was included for validation. Urinary proteome changes were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted to discover affected biological processes. Results: Dapagliflozin treatment significantly (P-adjusted < 0.05) affected 36 urinary peptide fragments derived from 19 proteins. Eighteen proteins were correspondingly reflected in the validation cohort. A multifold change in peptide abundance was observed in many proteins (A1BG, urinary albumin [ALB], Caldesmon 1, COLCRNN, heat shock protein 90-beta [HSP90AB1], IGLL5, peptidase inhibitor 16 [PI16], prostaglandin-H2-D-isomerase [PTGDS], SERPINA1). These also included urinary biomarkers of kidney fibrosis and function (type I and III collagens and albumin). Biological processes relating to inflammation, wound healing, and kidney fibrosis were enriched. Conclusion: The current study discovers the urinary proteome impacted by the SGLT2i, thereby providing new potential target sites and pathways, especially relating to wound healing and inflammation.;;"Steno Diabetes Center; University of Copenhagen; Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) Solutions; Medical University of Innsbruck; University of Copenhagen; Steno Diabetes Center";;;;;;;;;;3;3;;;;;;;;;;;FEB;2024;9;2;;;;;334;346;;10.1016/j.ekir.2023.11.020;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2023.11.020;;FEB 2024;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001171723800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

To elucidate the underlying changes associated with obesity, we performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in the liver and plasma of obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and integrated these data with publicly available transcriptomic and proteomic datasets of obesity and metabolic diseases in preclinical and clinical cohorts. We quantified 7173 and 555 proteins in the liver and plasma proteomes, respectively. The abundance of proteins related to fatty acid metabolism were increased, alongside peroxisomal proliferation in ob/ob liver. Putatively secreted proteins and the secretory machinery were also dysregulated in the liver, which was mirrored by a substantial alteration of the plasma proteome. Greater than 50% of the plasma proteins were differentially regulated, including NAFLD biomarkers, lipoproteins, the 20S proteasome, and the complement and coagulation cascades of the immune system. Integration of the liver and plasma proteomes identified proteins that were concomitantly regulated in the liver and plasma in obesity, suggesting that the systemic abundance of these plasma proteins is regulated by secretion from the liver. Many of these proteins are systemically regulated during type 2 diabetes and/or NAFLD in humans, indicating the clinical importance of liver- plasma cross talk and the relevance of our investigations in ob/ob mice. Together, these analyses yield a comprehensive insight into obesity and provide an extensive resource for obesity research in a prevailing model organism.;;"Novo Nordisk Foundation; University of Copenhagen; Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska Institutet; University of Copenhagen; Novo Nordisk Foundation";;;;;;;;;;19;20;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2022;21;3;;;;;;;100207;10.1016/j.mcpro.2022.100207;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcpro.2022.100207;;MAR 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000775977500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

We aimed to identify differentially expressed circulating biomarkers in obese HFpEF patients and link them to disease severity and outcomes. Methods and results From the LIFE-Heart study, 999 patients with HFpEF and 999 patients without heart failure (no-HF) were selected and 92 circulating serum biomarkers were measured using a proximity extension assay. Elevation of identified biomarkers was validated in 220 patients from the Aldo-DHF trial with diagnosed HFpEF. HFpEF patients were older and had more comorbidities including coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes as compared to no-HF patients (P < 0.05 for all). After adjusting for covariates, adrenomedullin (ADM), galectin-9 (Gal-9), thrombospondin-2 (THBS-2), CD4, and tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) were significantly higher in obese HFpEF patients [body mass index (BMI) >= 30 kg/m(2), n = 464] as compared to lean HFpEF (BMI <30 kg/m(2), n = 535) and obese no-HF patients (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2), n = 387) (P < 0.001 for both); these findings were verified in the Aldo-DHF validation cohort (P < 0.001). Except for CD4 these proteins were associated with increased estimates of left atrial pressure in a linear fashion. Importantly, ADM and CD4 were associated with increased mortality in obese HFpEF patients after adjusting for covariates. Conclusion Obese HFpEF patients exhibit higher circulating biomarkers of volume expansion (ADM), myocardial fibrosis (THBS-2) and systemic inflammation (Gal-9, CD4) compared to obese non-HFpEF or lean HFpEF patients. These findings support the clinical definition of a distinct obese HFpEF phenotype and might merit further investigation.";;"Leipzig University; Heart Center Leipzig GMBH; Leipzig University; Leipzig University; Leipzig University; Leipzig University; Leipzig University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Leipzig University; University of Gottingen; UNIVERSITY GOTTINGEN HOSPITAL; Leipzig University; Berlin Institute of Health; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; German Centre for Cardiovascular Research";;;;;;;;;;30;32;;;;;;;;;;;OCT;2021;23;10;;;;;1633;1644;;10.1002/ejhf.2291;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.2291;;JUL 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000675095900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Metabolomics provides substantial insights into the biological understanding of environmental factors such as diet. This study aimed to identify metabolomic markers of regression to normoglycemia in the context of a lifestyle intervention (LSI) in individuals with prediabetes. Research design and methods We conducted a single-arm intervention study with 24 weeks of follow-up. Eligible study participants had at least one prediabetes criteria according to the American Diabetes Association guidelines, and body mass index between 25 and 45 kg/m(2). LSI refers to a hypocaloric diet and >150 min of physical activity per week. Regression to normoglycemia (RNGR) was defined as achieving hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <5.5% in the final visit. Baseline and postintervention plasma metabolomic profiles were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. To select metabolites associated with RNGR, we conducted the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-penalized regressions. Results The final sample was composed of 82 study participants. Changes in three metabolites were significantly associated with regression to normoglycemia; N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (OR=0.54; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.82), putrescine (OR=0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98), and 7-methylguanine (OR=1.06; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17), independent of HbA1c and weight loss. In addition, metabolomic perturbations due to LSI displayed enrichment of taurine and hypotaurine metabolism pathway (p=0.03) compatible with biomarkers of protein consumption, lower red meat and animal fats and higher seafood and vegetables.

Identifying novel biomarkers that predict ARB response may help tailor therapy. We aimed to discover and validate a serum metabolite classifier that predicts albuminuria response to ARBs in patients with diabetes mellitus and micro- or macroalbuminuria. Methods: Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics was performed on serum samples. Data from patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria (n = 49) treated with irbesartan 300 mg/day were used for discovery. LASSO and ridge regression were performed to develop the classifier. Improvement in albuminuria response prediction was assessed by calculating differences in R-2 between a reference model of clinical parameters and a model with clinical parameters and the classifier. The classifier was externally validated in patients with type 1 diabetes and macroalbuminuria (n = 50) treated with losartan 100 mg/day. Molecular process analysis was performed to link metabolites to molecular mechanisms contributing to ARB response. Results: In discovery, median change in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was -42 % [Q1-Q3: -69 to -8]. The classifier, consisting of 21 metabolites, was significantly associated with UAE response to irbesartan (p < 0.001) and improved prediction of UAE response on top of the clinical reference model (R2 increase from 0.10 to 0.70; p < 0.001). In external validation, median change in UAE was -43 % [Q1-Q35: -63 to -23]. The classifier improved prediction of UAE response to losartan (R2 increase from 0.20 to 0.59; p < 0.001). Specifically ADMA impacting eNOS activity appears to be a relevant factor in ARB response.

The main features of PCOS are hyperandrogenism and irregular menstrual cycles together with metabolic dysfunctions including hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance and a 4-fold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Despite the high prevalence the pathophysiology of the syndrome is unclear. Insulin resistance in women with PCOS likely affect the skeletal muscle and recently it was demonstrated that changes in DNA methylation affects the gene expression in skeletal muscle that in part can explain their metabolic abnormalities. The objective of this work was to combine gene expression array data from different datasets to improve statistical power and thereby identify novel biomarkers that can be further explored. In this narrative review, we performed a meta-analysis of skeletal muscle arrays available from Gene Expression Omnibus and from publications. The eligibility criteria were published articles in English, and baseline (no treatment) skeletal muscle samples from women with PCOS and controls. The R package Metafor was used for integration of the datasets. One hundred and fourteen unique transcripts were differentially expressed in skeletal muscle from women with PCOS vs. controls (q < 0.05), 87% of these transcripts have not been previously identified as altered in PCOS muscle. ING2, CDKAL1, and AKTIP had the largest differential increase in expression, and TSHZ2, FKBP2, and OCEL1 had the largest decrease in expression. Two genes, IRX3 and CDKAL1 were consistently upregulated (q < 0.05) in the individual analyses and meta-analysis. Based on the meta-analysis, we identified several dysregulated immunometabolic pathways as a part of the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle of women with PCOS. The transcriptomic data need to be verified by functional analyses as well as proteomics to advance our understanding of PCOS specific insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.;;"Karolinska Institutet; University of Gothenburg; University of Skovde";;;;;;;;;;9;9;;;;;;;;;;;OCT 22;2020;11;;;;;;;;573505;10.3389/fphys.2020.573505;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.573505;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000585466300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

As one of the main tissues involved in uptake of glucose under the stimulation of insulin, WAT plays very important role in metabolic and homeostasis regulation. We performed a differential proteomics study to investigate alterations in epididymis fat pad of high fat diet fed T2D KKAy mice compared to normal fed C57BL/6J mice, by O-18-labeling relative quantitative technique. Among 329 confidently identified proteins, 121 proteins showed significant changes with CV <= 20% (fold changes of > 2 or < 0.5 as threshold). According to GO classification, we found that altered proteins contained members of biological processes of metabolic process, oxidative stress, ion homeostasis, apoptosis and cell division. In metabolic, proteins assigned to fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS etc.) were decreased, the key enzyme (ACOX3) in beta-oxidation process was increased. Increased glycolysis enzymes (ENOB etc.) and decreased TCA cycle related enzymes (SCOT1 etc.) suggested that glucose metabolism in mitochondria of T2D mice might be impaired. Elevated oxidative stress was observed with alterations of a series of oxidordeuctase (QSOX1 etc.). Besides, alterations of ion homeostasis (AT2C1 etc.) proteins were also observed. The enhancement of cell proliferation associated proteins (ELYS etc.) and inhibition of apoptosis associated proteins (RASF6 etc.) in WAT might contributed to the fat pad and body weight gain. Overall, these changes in WAT may serve as a reference for understanding the functional mechanism of T2D.;;Beijing Institute of Technology;;;;;;;;;;8;8;;;;;;;;;;;MAR;2017;17;5;;;;;;;1600219;10.1002/pmic.201600219;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pmic.201600219;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000397390800003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Since BA alterations are associated with obesity and insulin resistance, plasma BAs have been considered candidates to predict type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. We aimed to determine (1) the association of BAs with glucose homeostasis parameters and (2) their predictive association with the risk of conversion from prediabetes to new-onset diabetes (NOD) in a prospective cohort study. Design: 205 patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) were followed each year during 5 years in the IT-DIAB cohort study. Twenty-one BA species and 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a marker of BA synthesis, were quantified by LC/MS-MS in plasma from fasted patients at baseline. Correlations between plasma BA species and metabolic parameters at baseline were assessed by Spearman's coefficients and the association between BAs and NOD was determined using Cox proportional-hazards models. Results: Among the analyzed BA species, total hyocholic acid (HCA) and the total HCA/total chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) ratio, reflecting hepatic BA 6 alpha-hydroxylation activity, negatively correlated with BMI and HOMA-IR. The total HCA/total CDCA ratio also correlated negatively with HbA(1C). Conversion from IFG to NOD occurred in 33.7% of the participants during the follow-up. Plasma BA species were not independently associated with the conversion to NOD after adjustment with classical T2D risk factors. Conclusions: Fasting plasma BAs are not useful clinical biomarkers for predicting NOD in patients with IFG. However, an unexpected association between 6 alpha-hydroxylated BAs and glucose parameters was found, suggesting a role for this specific BA pathway in metabolic homeostasis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Oxidative stress induced by various oxidants in a random and destructive manner is considered to play an important role in the pathophysiology of a number of human disorders and diseases such as impaired glucose tolerance. We have developed an improved method for the measurement of in vivo lipid peroxidation, where the presence of 8-iso-prostaglandin F-2 alpha (8-iso-PGF(2 alpha)), hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and 7-hydroxycholesterol (7-OHCh), as well as their parent molecules, linoleic acid (LA) and cholesterol (Ch), was determined by performing LC-MS/MS (for 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha), HODE, and HETE) and GC-MS (for 7-OHCh, LA, and Ch) after reduction with triphenyl phosphine and saponification by potassium hydroxide. We then applied this method to volunteers (n = 57), including normal type (n = 43), high-normal'' (fasting plasma glucose, 100-109 mg/dL, n = 7), pre-diabetic type (IGT, n = 5), and diabetic type (n = 2) subjects who are diagnosed by performing oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). Several biomarkers in plasma, such as insulin, leptin, adiponectin, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-a, high sensitivity-C-reactive protein, HbA1c, and glucose levels were measured during OGTT. We found that the fasting levels of (10- and 12-(Z,E)-HODE)/LA increased significantly with increasing levels of HbA1c and glucose during OGTT and with insulin secretion and resistance index. In conclusion, 10-and 12-(Z,E)-HODE may be prominent biomarkers for the early detection of IGT and high-normal'' type without OGTT.;;"National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); Tokushima University; Kagawa University";;;;;;;;;;50;54;;;;;;;;;;;MAY 15;2013;8;5;;;;;;;e63542;10.1371/journal.pone.0063542;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0063542;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000319052700045;View Full Record in Web of Science

MTS and its component metabolic diseases are heterogeneous and closely related, making their relationships complicated, thus hindering precision treatment. Methods: We collected seven groups of samples (group a: healthy individuals; group b: obesity; group c: MTS; group d: hyperglycemia, group e: hypertension, group f: hyperlipidemia; group g: type II diabetes, n=7 for each group). We examined the molecular characteristics of each sample by metabolomic, proteomic and peptidomic profiling analysis. The differential molecules (including metabolites, proteins and peptides) between each disease group and the healthy group were recognized by statistical analyses. Furthermore, a two-step clustering workflow which combines multi-omics and clinical information was used to redefine molecularly and clinically differential groups. Meanwhile, molecular, clinical, network and pathway based analyses were used to identify the group-specific biological features. Results: Both shared and disease-specific molecular profiles among the six types of diseases were identified. Meanwhile, the patients were stratified into three distinct groups which were different from original disease definitions but presented significant differences in glucose and lipid metabolism (Group 1: relatively favorable metabolic conditions; Group 2: severe dyslipidemia; Group 3: dysregulated insulin and glucose). Group specific biological signatures were also systematically described. The dyslipidemia group showed higher levels in multiple lipid metabolites like phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine, and showed significant up-regulations in lipid and amino acid metabolism pathways. The glucose dysregulated group showed higher levels in many polypeptides from proteins contributing to immune response. The another group, with better glucose/lipid metabolism ability, showed higher levels in lipid regulating enzymes like the lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase and proteins involved in complement and coagulation cascades.

Four independent cohorts encompassing 754 individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and early and late diabetic kidney disease were followed to ascertain progression to kidney failure. During ten years of follow-up, 227 of 754 individuals progressed to kidney failure. Using the SOMAscan proteomics platform, we measured baseline concentration of 1129 circulating proteins. In our previous publications, we analyzed 334 of these proteins that were members of specific candidate pathways involved in diabetic kidney disease and found 35 proteins strongly associated with risk of progression to kidney failure. Here, we examined the remaining 795 proteins using an untargeted approach. Of these remaining proteins, 11 were significantly associated with progression to kidney failure. Biological processes previously reported for these proteins were related to neuron development (DLL1, MATN2, NRX1B, KLK8, RTN4R and ROR1) and were implicated in the development of kidney fibrosis (LAYN, DLL1, MAPK11, MATN2, endostatin, and ROR1) in cellular and animal studies. Specific mechanisms that underlie involvement of these proteins in progression of diabetic kidney disease must be further investigated to assess their value as targets for kidney-protective therapies. Using multivariable LASSO regression analysis, five proteins (LAYN, ESAM, DLL1, MAPK11 and endostatin) were found independently associated with risk of progression to kidney failure. Thus, our study identified proteins that may be considered as new candidate prognostic biomarkers to predict risk of progression to kidney failure in diabetic kidney disease.

The pathophysiology seems to be largely attributable to the imbalance of lipid and glucose metabolism, redox signaling pathways, and gut microbiota. The increased syndromes, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease demands natural therapeutic attention for those at high risk. Vine tea, as a traditional medicinal and edible resource rich in flavonoids, especially for dihydromyricetin (DHM), exhibits promising health benefits on the intervention of MS, but the specific molecular mechanism has not been systematically elucidated. The present article aims to summarize the regulatory effects and biological targets of vine tea or DHM on MS, and analyze the underlying potential molecular mechanisms in cells, animals, and humans, mainly by regulating the redox associated signaling pathways, such as Nrf2, NF-kappa B, PI3K/IRS2/AKT, AMPK-PGC1 alpha-SIRT1, SIRT3 pathways, and the crosstalk among them, and by targeting several key biomarkers. Moreover, vine tea extract or DHM has a positive impact on the modulation of intestinal microecology by upregulating the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) and increasing the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila. Therefore, this review updated the latest important theoretical basis and molecular evidence for the development and application of vine tea in dietary functional products or drugs against MS and also imputed the future perspectives to clarify the deep mechanism among vine tea or DHM, redox associated signaling pathways, and gut microbiota.;;"Hunan Agricultural University; Hunan Agricultural University";;;;;;;;;;8;8;;;;;;;;;;;FEB 17;2022;9;;;;;;;;802015;10.3389/fnut.2022.802015;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.802015;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000764530800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

GGJTW is used for treatment of diabetes in China, reflecting the potent hypoglycemic effect of its ingredients. However, little is known of the hypoglycemic effect of GGJTW and the underlying metabolic mechanism. Aim of the study: This study aimed to investigate the hypoglycemic effect of GGJTW in type 2 diabetic rats and the metabolic mechanism of action. Materials and methods: Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS)-based metabolomics approach was used for monitoring hyperglycaemia induced by high-sugar high-fat fodder and streptozotocin (STZ), and the protective effect of GGJTW. Dynamic fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, body weight, and biochemical parameters, including lipid levels, hepatic-renal function, and hepatic histopathology were used to confirm the hyperglycaemic toxicity and attenuation effects. An orthogonal partial least squared-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) approach highlighted significant differences in the metabolome of the healthy control, diabetic, and drug-treated rats. The metabolomics pathway analysis (MetPA) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) database were used to investigate the underlying metabolic pathways. Results: Metabolic profiling revealed 37 metabolites as the most potential biomarker metabolites distinguishing GGJTW-treated rats from model rats. Most of the metabolites were primarily associated with bile acid metabolism and lipid metabolism. The most critical pathway was primary bile acid biosynthesis pathway involving the up-regulation of the levels of cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), taurocholic acid (TCA), glycocholic acid (GCA), taurochenodesoxycholic acid (TCDCA), and taurine. Conclusions: The significantly-altered metabolite levels indicated the hypoglycemic effect of GGJTW on diabetic rats and the underlying metabolic mechanism.

However, patients exposed to prolonged high levels of cortisol in Cushing syndrome (CS) present exceeding cardiometabolic alterations not reflected by conventional biomarkers. Using 3 ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) platforms, we aimed to characterise the serum metabolome of 25 patients with active endogenous CS and 25 control subjects matched by propensity score (sex, BMI, diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2D), high blood pressure (HBP) and dyslipidaemia) to search for potential disease-specific biomarkers and pathways associated to the clinical comorbidities. A total of 93 metabolites were significantly altered in patients with CS. Increased levels of sulfur amino acids (AA), triacylglycerols, glycerophospholipids, ceramides and cholesteryl esters were observed. Contrarily, concentrations of essential and non-essential AA, polyunsaturated fatty acids, conjugated bile acids and second messenger glycerolipids were decreased. Twenty-four-hour urinary free cortisol (24h-UFC) independently determined the concentration of 21 lipids and 4 AA. A metabolic signature composed by 10 AA and 10 lipid metabolites presented an AUC-ROC of 95% for the classification of CS patients.

The aim of this study was to investigate the independent association between mannose and a first MI in a group of subjects characterized according to their glycaemic state. Methods Fasting plasma mannose concentrations were analysed in 777 patients 6-10 weeks after a first myocardial infarction and in 770 matched controls by means of high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Participants without known diabetes mellitus were categorized by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n = 1045), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n = 246) or newly detected type 2 diabetes (T2DM, n = 112). The association between mannose and MI was investigated across these glycaemic states by logistic regression. Results Mannose levels increased across the glycaemic states (p < 0.0001) and were significantly associated with a first MI in the whole study population (odds ratio, OR: 2.2; 95% CI 1.4 to - 3.5). Considering the different subgroups separately, the association persisted only in subjects with NGT (adjusted OR: 2.0; 95% CI 1.2-3.6), but not in subgroups with glucose perturbations (adjusted OR: 1.8, 95% CI 0.8-3.7). Conclusions Mannose concentrations increased across worsening levels of glucose perturbations but were independently associated with a first MI only in NGT individuals. Thus, mannose might be a novel, independent risk marker for MI, possibly targeted for the early management of previously unidentified patients at high cardiovascular risk.";;"Karolinska Institutet; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica (IFC-CNR); Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital; Saint Goran's Hospital; Royal Institute of Technology; University of Pisa";;;;;;;;;;5;7;;;;;;;;;;;SEP 23;2022;21;1;;;;;;;195;10.1186/s12933-022-01630-5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12933-022-01630-5;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000859024600003;View Full Record in Web of Science

The gut microbiome recently emerged as a significant player in liver metabolism and health. Hippurate, a host-microbial co-metabolite has been associated with human gut microbial gene richness and with metabolic health. However, its role on liver metabolism and homeostasis is poorly understood. Methods: We characterised liver biospies from 318 patients with obesity using RNAseq and metabolomics in liver and plasma to derive associations among hepatic hippurate, hepatic gene expression and MASLD and phenotypes. To test a potential beneficial role for hippurate in hepatic insulin resistance, we profile the metabolome of (IHH) using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), and characterised intracellular triglyceride accumulation and glucose internalisation after a 24 h insulin exposure. Results: We first report significant associations among MASLD traits, plasma and hepatic hippurate. Further analysis of the hepatic transcriptome shows that liver and plasma hippurate are inversely associated with MASLD, implicating lipid metabolism and regulation of inflammatory responses pathways. Hippurate treatment inhibits lipid accumulation and rescues insulin resistance induced by 24-hour chronic insulin in IHH. Hippurate also improves hepatocyte metabolic profiles by increasing the abundance of metabolites involved in energy homeostasis that are depleted by chronic insulin treatment while decreasing those involved in inflammation. Conclusions: Altogether, our results further highlight hippurate as a mechanistic marker of metabolic health, by its ability to improve metabolic homeostasis as a postbiotic candidate.

However, IAbs do not fully meet the need for the prediction and intervention of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Serological proteins should be great sources for biomarkers. Objective: This work aimed to identify new proteomic biomarkers with the technology of an expression-based genome-wide association study (eGWAS) in children newly diagnosed with T1D. Methods: In an attempt to identify additional biomarkers, we performed an eGWAS using microarray data from 169 arrays of the pancreatic islets of T1D rodents (78 T1D cases and 91 controls). We ranked all 16 099 protein-coding genes by the likelihood of differential expression in the pancreatic islets. Our top 20 secreted proteins were screened in 170 children including 100 newly diagnosed T1D, and 50 type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 20 age-matched healthy children. With 6 proteins showing significance, we further conducted a validation study using the second independent set of 400 samples from children including 200 newly diagnosed with T1D, 100T2D, and 100 age-matched controls. Results: We identified 2 serum proteins that were significantly changed in T1 D vs both control and T2D, and 5 serum proteins were significantly changed both in T1D and T2D vs control. Serum osteopontin (OPN) levels were uniquely higher in T1D (T1 D vs controls, P = 1.29E-13 similar to 9.38E-7 T1D vs T2D, P = 2.65E-8 similar to 1.58E-7) with no difference between T2D and healthy control individuals. Serum interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (MA RA) levels were lower in T1D compared both with T2D (P= 3.36E-9 similar to 0.0236) and healthy participants (P= 1.09E-79 similar to 2.00E-12). Conclusion: Our results suggest that OPN and IL1-RA could be candidates for useful biomarkers for T1D in children.;;"University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Children's Hospital Colorado; Kitasato University; Kitasato University; International University of Health & Welfare";;;;;;;;;;1;1;;;;;;;;;;;JUN 16;2022;107;7;;;;;1825;1832;;10.1210/clinem/dgac256;http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgac256;;MAY 2022;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000799411100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

A range of computational tools is now available for both isotopically labeled and label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based quantitative proteomics. However, they are generally not comparable to each other in terms of functionality, user interfaces, information input/output, and do not readily facilitate appropriate statistical data analysis. These limitations, along with the array of choices, present a daunting prospect for biologists, and other researchers not trained in bioinformatics, who wish to use LC-MS-based quantitative proteomics. Results: We have developed Corra, a computational framework and tools for discovery-based LC-MS proteomics. Corra extends and adapts existing algorithms used for LC-MS-based proteomics, and statistical algorithms, originally developed for microarray data analyses, appropriate for LC-MS data analysis. Corra also adapts software engineering technologies (e. g. Google Web Toolkit, distributed processing) so that computationally intense data processing and statistical analyses can run on a remote server, while the user controls and manages the process from their own computer via a simple web interface. Corra also allows the user to output significantly differentially abundant LC-MS-detected peptide features in a form compatible with subsequent sequence identification via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). We present two case studies to illustrate the application of Corra to commonly performed LC-MS-based biological workflows: a pilot biomarker discovery study of glycoproteins isolated from human plasma samples relevant to type 2 diabetes, and a study in yeast to identify in vivo targets of the protein kinase Ark1 via phosphopeptide profiling. Conclusion: The Corra computational framework leverages computational innovation to enable biologists or other researchers to process, analyze and visualize LC-MS data with what would otherwise be a complex and not user-friendly suite of tools. Corra enables appropriate statistical analyses, with controlled false-discovery rates, ultimately to inform subsequent targeted identification of differentially abundant peptides by MS/MS. For the user not trained in bioinformatics, Corra represents a complete, customizable, free and open source computational platform enabling LC-MS-based proteomic workflows, and as such, addresses an unmet need in the LC-MS proteomics field.;;"Institute for Systems Biology (ISB); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; University of Zurich";;;;;;;;;;56;63;;;;;;;;;;;DEC 16;2008;9;;;;;;;;542;10.1186/1471-2105-9-542;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-542;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000263973600003;View Full Record in Web of Science

Proteins increased in AD have been reported to include fibronectin (FN) fragments 3 and 4 (FN1.3 and FN1.4, respectively) and ApoE. We hypothesized that Alzheimer-related proteins would be dysregulated in PCOS because of associated insulin resistance and obesity. In this comparative cross-sectional analysis, aptamer-based SomaScan proteomic analysis for the detection of plasma Alzheimer-related proteins was undertaken in a PCOS biobank of 143 women with PCOS and 97 control women. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) (p < 0.05) and amyloid P-component (APCS) (p < 0.001) were elevated in PCOS, while alpha-synuclein (SNCA) (p < 0.05) was reduced in PCOS. Associations with protective heat shock proteins (HSPs) showed that SNCA positively correlated with HSP90 (p < 0.0001) and HSP60 (p < 0.0001) in both the PCOS and control women. Correlations with markers of inflammation showed that APCS correlated with interleukin 6 (IL6) (p = 0.04), while Apolipoprotein (Apo) E3 correlated with TNF-alpha (p = 0.02). FN, FN1.3, FN1.4 and ApoE were all elevated significantly (p < 0.05). An AD-associated protein pattern with elevated FN, FN1.3, FN1.4 and ApoE was found in PCOS, in addition to elevated APP and reduced SNCA, which was the same as reported for type 2 diabetes (T2D) with, additionally, an elevation in APCS. With the AD biomarker pattern in PCOS being very similar to that in T2D, where there is an association between AD and T2D, this suggests that larger prospective cohort studies are needed in women with PCOS to determine if there is a causal association with AD.;;"Royal College of Surgeons - Ireland; Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland - Medical University of Bahrain; University of Hull; University of York - UK";;;;;;;;;;4;4;;;;;;;;;;;JAN;2024;25;2;;;;;;;1158;10.3390/ijms25021158;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms25021158;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001152964600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, more investigations into new DN-related biomarkers are needed. Methods We employed urinary proteomic approach of fluorescence-based difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) and mass spectrometry to identify novel biomarkers in urine samples, which were from type 2 diabetes patients with normoalbuminuria (DM group), microalbuminuria (DN1 group), macroalbuminuria (DN2 group) and control group (n = 8 in each group). The identified biomarker was further studied by western blot in urine samples (n = 6 in each group) and immunohistochemistry in renal biopsies. Besides, the urinary level of biomarker was detected and analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) method (n = 40 in each group). Results A novel DN-related biomarker, urinary E-cadherin, was identified by proteomic methods, which up-regulated 1.3-fold, 5.2-fold and 8.5-fold in DM, DN1 and DN2 groups compared with control group. Meanwhile, high expression of urinary soluble 80 kDa fragment of E-cadherin (sE-cadherin) was verified in DN groups by western blot. The ELISA data also demonstrated that urinary sE-cadherin-to-creatinine ratio was significantly increased in DN1 and DN2 groups versus DM group or control group (2751.5 +/- 164 and 5839.6 +/- 428 vs 721.9 +/- 93 or 652.7 +/- 87 mu g/g; p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of urinary sE-cadherin for diagnosis of DN were calculated as 78.8% (95% CI, 74-83%) and 80% (95% CI, 65-91%). Besides, immunohistochemical stain showed that E-cadherin expression was markedly decreased in renal tubular epithelial cells of patients with DN versus healthy controls. Conclusions Urinary sE-cadherin has a potential clinical diagnostic value for DN and E-cadherin may participate in the pathogenesis of DN.

BackgroundLimited knowledge exists regarding short-term changes/increases in concentrations of circulating proteins (referred here as deltas) and rapid development of kidney failure (rapid KF) in diabetes mellitus.MethodsConcentrations of 452 circulating proteins were measured using the OLINK proteomics platform at baseline and after a median interval of 3-4 years in 106 individuals with type 1 and 77 with type 2 diabetes in two case-control studies. During 10-year follow-up, 31 and 26 individuals, respectively, developed rapid KF.ResultsDeltas for 40 proteins predicted rapid KF in both studies. All were better predictors than delta urine albumin-creatinine ratio, and half were better than delta glomerular filtration rate. Comparing the delta proteins with 46 circulating proteins of which elevated baseline concentrations were predictors of rapid KF risk in our previous study, 61 unique proteins were identified. Among these proteins, 21 were good predictors of rapid KF only when measured at baseline (predictors of initiation), 15 were good predictors when measured as deltas (predictors of progression), and 25 were good predictors when both baseline and delta concentrations were used (predictors of initiation and progression). An index score, developed for the latter 25 proteins, provided superior prediction of rapid KF. A subset of these latter proteins was associated with apoptotic processes/TNF receptor signaling pathways.ConclusionsDevelopment of rapid KF in diabetes was preceded by elevated concentrations of multiple circulating proteins both at baseline and during short-term follow-up. Comparing baseline and short-term changes in concentrations of circulating proteins classified predictors of rapid KF risk into those associated with initiation, progression, or both. Predictors of both initiation and progression flagged apoptosis processes and TNF receptor signaling pathways.

In this research, a flow injection tandem mass spectrometry (FI-MS/MS) method for simultaneous measurement of AAs and acylcarnitines in addition to results of validation is explained. Methods Samples were mixed with internal standards and after derivatization (with butanolic-HCL), AAs, and acylcarnitines were quantified by tandem mass spectrometry (SCIEX API 3200). Analytical performance studies were designed based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines including precision, accuracy, linearity, and limit of detection-quantification (LOD-LOQ) experiments. Samples from patients with T2D in different stages of kidney disease were also analyzed to ensure the clinical usage of the method. Results Performance evaluation of the method demonstrated adequate results. The mean of estimated inter-assay precision (reported as a coefficient variation) for AAs and acylcarnitines were less than 8.7% and 12.3%, the estimated mean bias was below 8.8% and 10.2% respectively. LOD of analytes ranged between 0.6-10 mu mol per liter (mu mol/L) for AAs and 0.02-1 mu mol/L for acylcarnitines. LOQ analytes showed a range of 2-25 mu mol/L and 0.05-5 mu mol/L for AAs and carnitine/acylcarnitines respectively. In diabetic patients sample analysis, a significant increase in acylcarnitines (C2, C4, C5DC, C6, C8, C10, C14) and citrulline with a significant decrease in valine were seen in patients with severely increased albuminuria. Conclusion FI-MS/MS method with pre-injection derivatization with butanolic-HCL can be used for concurrent measurement of AAs and carnitine/acylcarnitines in a short time and it satisfies the analytical performance requirements. This method is applied for AAs and carnitine/acylcarnitines measurement in patient with T2DM and results show some of the acylcarnitines and AAs can be involved in diabetic nephropathy development.;;"University of Bristol; Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Tehran University of Medical Sciences; Tehran University of Medical Sciences";;;;;;;;;;15;16;;;;;;;;;;;JUN;2021;20;1;;;;;591;599;;10.1007/s40200-021-00786-3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40200-021-00786-3;;MAR 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000636315500002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Current clinical tools cannot predict whether or not patients will respond to treatment with RAS inhibitors (RASi). We aimed to investigate whether proteome analysis could identify urinary peptides as biomarkers that could predict the response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin-receptor blockers treatment to avoid DKD progression. Furthermore, we investigated the comparability of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated using four different GFR equations, for DKD progression.Methods We evaluated urine samples from a discovery cohort of 199 diabetic patients treated with RASi. DKD progression was defined based on eGFR percentage slope results between visits (similar to 1 year) and for the entire period (similar to 3 years) based on the eGFR values of each GFR equation. Urine samples were analysed using capillary electrophoresis-coupled mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was performed between the uncontrolled (patients who did not respond to RASi treatment) and controlled kidney function groups (patients who responded to the RASi treatment). Peptides were combined in a support vector machine-based model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the risk prediction models in two independent validation cohorts treated with RASi.Results The classification of patients into uncontrolled and controlled kidney function varies depending on the GFR equation used, despite the same sample set. We identified 227 peptides showing nominal significant difference and consistent fold changes between uncontrolled and controlled patients in at least three methods of eGFR calculation.

However, the exact mechanisms of NAFLD pathophysiology remain poorly understood including its progression to the more severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). New advances for early detection and monitoring of NASH progression are limited due to the lack of specific blood biomarkers, thus requiring invasive liver biopsies for histopathology. Herein, multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS/MS) is validated as a high throughput, robust, and quantitative platform for targeted analysis of a panel of 16 serum gamma-glutamyl dipeptides from a cohort of NASH adult patients from Japan (median age = 53 years, median BMI = 27 kg/m(2), n = 116). Multiplexed separations based on MSI-CE-MS/MS enable the design of unique data workflows that rely on customizable serial sample injection formats for accurate determination of gamma-glutamyl dipeptides with quality control. Also, the introduction of a liquid coolant device to the capillary outlet improves long-term migration time stability in CE. Unsupervised pattern recognition methods revealed two distinctive NASH subgroups based on their contrasting gamma-glutamyl dipeptide status despite patients having similar clinical phenotypes and NASH activity scores (median NAS approximate to 6.0). There was an inverse correlation between serum gamma-glutamyl dipeptide concentrations and gamma- glutamyltransferease (GGT) enzyme activity (r = -0.46; p = 2.5 x 10(-7)), which was indicative of a low-risk (n = 64) as compared to a high-risk (n = 52) patient subgroup with impaired glutathione salvage pathway and likely poor clinical prognosis. Our findings highlight the key role of defects in the gamma-glutamyl cycle for differentiation of NASH patients, which may enable better risk assessment of long-term survivorship as a complement to standard liver enzyme screens and histopathology.";;"McMaster University; Tokyo Women's Medical University";;;;;;;;;;16;17;;;;;;;;;;;JUL 2;2020;19;7;;;;;2689;2699;;10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00405;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00405;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000547481300016;View Full Record in Web of Science

Specific amino acids may acutely and chronically regulate insulin secretion from the pancreatic p-cells. We recently identified a metabolic signature of N-acetyl leucine (Ac-Leu) that strongly predicts diabetes development in mice hair. The Ac-Leu appears to be a potential biomarker candidate related to diabetes. However, the determination of Ac-Leu in human hair has not been reported. We measured the Ac-Leu, and its structure is similar to N-acetyl isoleucine (Ac-Ile) in human hair by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). The developed method was applied to the determination of Ac-Leu and Ac-Ile in the hair of healthy volunteers (HV) and DP. Methods: Ac-Leu, Ac-Ile and N-acetyl norleucine (Ac-Nle, IS) were extracted from human hair samples by a micropulverized extraction procedure, then separated on a C18 column by isocratic elution of acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid in water:0.1% formic acid (14:86, vol./vol.). MRM using the fragmentation transitions of m/z 174.1 -> 86.1 in the positive ESI mode was performed to quantify the N-acetyl leucine, N-acetyl isoleucine and IS. Results: Ac-Leu, Ac-Ile and Ac-Nle in the human hair samples were completely separated by isocratic elution of a 5.0 mm duration wash program using a reversed-phase column, and sensitively detected by LC-MS/MS in the ESI MRM mode. The amounts of Ac-Leu and Ac-Ile in the hairs of HV and DP were determined. When comparing the concentrations between DP and those from HV, a statistically significant correlation was observed for the AcLeu (p < 0.001) and Ac-Ile (p < 0.01). Conclusions: The proposed method is useful for the determination of Ac-Leu and Ac-Ile in the hairs of DP and HV. Human hair may serve as a noninvasive biosample for the diagnosis of diabetes.

The identification of causal or protective biomarkers for COVID-19 severity may facilitate the development of novel therapies. Objective To identify protein biomarkers that promote or reduce COVID-19 severity and that mediate the association of cardiometabolic risk factors with COVID-19 severity. Design, Setting, and Participants This genetic association study using 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted in 2022 to investigate associations among cardiometabolic risk factors, circulating biomarkers, and COVID-19 hospitalization. Inputs for MR included genetic and proteomic data from 4147 participants with dysglycemia and cardiovascular risk factors collected through the Outcome Reduction With Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial. Genome-wide association study summary statistics were obtained from (1) 3 additional independent plasma proteome studies, (2) genetic consortia for selected cardiometabolic risk factors (including body mass index [BMI], type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and systolic blood pressure; all n >10000), and (3) the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (n=5773 hospitalized and 15497 nonhospitalized case participants with COVID-19). Data analysis was performed in July 2022. Exposures Genetically determined concentrations of 235 circulating proteins assayed with a multiplex biomarker panel from the ORIGIN trial for the initial analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures Hospitalization status of individuals from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative with a positive COVID-19 test result. Results Among 235 biomarkers tested in samples totaling 22101 individuals, MR analysis showed that higher kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) levels reduced the likelihood of COVID-19 hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] per SD increase in KIM-1 levels,0.86 [95% CI, 0.79-0.93]). A meta-analysis validated the protective association with no observed directional pleiotropy (OR per SD increase in KIM-1 levels,0.91 [95% CI, 0.88-0.95]). Of the cardiometabolic risk factors studied, only BMI was associated with KIM-1 levels (0.17 SD increase in biomarker level per 1 kg/m(2) [95% CI, 0.08-0.26]) and COVID-19 hospitalization (OR per 1-SD biomarker level, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.18-1.50]). Multivariable MR analysis also revealed that KIM-1 partially mitigated the association of BMI with COVID-19 hospitalization, reducing it by 10 percentage points (OR adjusted for KIM-1 level per 1 kg/m(2), 1.23 [95% CI, 1.06-1.43]). Conclusions and Relevance In this genetic association study, KIM-1 was identified as a potential mitigator of COVID-19 severity, possibly attenuating the increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization among individuals with high BMI.

The paradigm change from reactive to predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (3PM/PPPM) has been declared as an essential transformation of the overall healthcare approach to benefit the patient and society at large. To this end, specific biomarker panels are instrumental for a cost-effective predictive approach of individualized prevention and treatments tailored to the person. The source of biomarkers is crucial for specificity and reliability of diagnostic tests and treatment targets. Furthermore, any diagnostic approach preferentially should be noninvasive to increase availability of the biomaterial, and to decrease risks of potential complications as well as concomitant costs. These requirements are clearly fulfilled by tear fluid, which represents a precious source of biomarker panels. The well-justified principle of a sick eye in a sick body makes comprehensive tear fluid biomarker profiling highly relevant not only for diagnostics of eye pathologies but also for prediction, prognosis, and treatment monitoring of systemic diseases. One prominent example is the Sicca syndrome linked to a cascade of severe complications that include dry eye, neurologic, and oncologic diseases. In this review, protein profiles in tear fluid are highlighted and corresponding biomarkers are exemplified for several relevant pathologies, including dry eye disease, diabetic retinopathy, cancers, and neurological disorders. Corresponding analytical approaches such as sample pre-processing, differential proteomics, electrophoretic techniques, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA), microarrays, and mass spectrometry (MS) methodology are detailed. Consequently, we proposed the overall strategies based on the tear fluid biomarkers application for 3P medicine practice. In the context of 3P medicine, tear fluid analytical pathways are considered to predict disease development, to target preventive measures, and to create treatment algorithms tailored to individual patient profiles.;;"Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Central South University; University of Bonn";;;;;;;;;;73;76;;;;;;;;;;;DEC;2021;12;4;;;SI;;449;475;;10.1007/s13167-021-00265-y;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13167-021-00265-y;;DEC 2021;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000725418500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Early diagnosis of NAFLD is important, as this can help prevent irreversible damage to the liver and, ultimately, hepatocellular carcinomas. We sought to expand etiological understanding and develop a diagnostic tool for NAFLD using machine learning. Methods and findings We utilized the baseline data from IMI DIRECT, a multicenter prospective cohort study of 3,029 European-ancestry adults recently diagnosed with T2D (n= 795) or at high risk of developing the disease (n= 2,234). Multi-omics (genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) and clinical (liver enzymes and other serological biomarkers, anthropometry, measures of beta-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and lifestyle) data comprised the key input variables. The models were trained on MRI-image-derived liver fat content (<5% or >= 5%) available for 1,514 participants. We applied LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) to select features from the different layers of omics data and random forest analysis to develop the models. The prediction models included clinical and omics variables separately or in combination. A model including all omics and clinical variables yielded a cross-validated receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROCAUC) of 0.84 (95% CI 0.82, 0.86;p <0.001), which compared with a ROCAUC of 0.82 (95% CI 0.81, 0.83;p <0.001) for a model including 9 clinically accessible variables. The IMI DIRECT prediction models outperformed existing noninvasive NAFLD prediction tools. One limitation is that these analyses were performed in adults of European ancestry residing in northern Europe, and it is unknown how well these findings will translate to people of other ancestries and exposed to environmental risk factors that differ from those of the present cohort. Another key limitation of this study is that the prediction was done on a binary outcome of liver fat quantity (<5% or >= 5%) rather than a continuous one. Conclusions In this study, we developed several models with different combinations of clinical and omics data and identified biological features that appear to be associated with liver fat accumulation. In general, the clinical variables showed better prediction ability than the complex omics variables. However, the combination of omics and clinical variables yielded the highest accuracy. We have incorporated the developed clinical models into a web interface (see:) and made it available to the community.";;"Lund University; Lund University; Halmstad University; University of Geneva; University of Geneva; Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics; Sanofi-Aventis; Sanofi Germany; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; University of Exeter; University of Westminster; University of Oxford; University of Dundee; University of Exeter; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam; University of Helsinki; Helsinki University Central Hospital; Royal Institute of Technology; Technical University of Denmark; University of Copenhagen; Novo Nordisk Foundation; University of Copenhagen; Bispebjerg Hospital; Newcastle University - UK; University of Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Dundee; University of Eastern Finland; University of Oxford; Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite de Lille; CHU Lille; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health; Steno Diabetes Center; Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC); Technical University of Munich; National University of Singapore; Sanofi-Aventis; Sanofi Germany; University of Cambridge; Novo Nordisk Foundation; University of Copenhagen; Imperial College London; University of Southern Denmark; University of Eastern Finland; Kuopio University Hospital; University of Eastern Finland; University of Eastern Finland Hospital; Novo Nordisk; Utrecht University; Utrecht University Medical Center; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); University of Oxford; Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; Roche Holding; Genentech; Roche Holding USA; Eli Lilly; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

Information on tinnitus onset and frequency was collected on biennial questionnaires (2009-2017). For cases, metabolomic profiles were measured (2015-2021) in blood samples collected after the date of the participant's first report of persistent tinnitus (NHS, 1989-1999 and 2010-2012; NHS II, 1996-1999). Data analyses were performed from January 24, 2022, to January 14, 2023.Exposures In total, 466 plasma metabolites from 488 cases of persistent tinnitus and 5989 controls were profiled using 3 complementary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry approaches.Main Outcomes and Measures Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of persistent tinnitus (per 1 SD increase in metabolite values) and 95% CIs for each individual metabolite.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and tolerability profiles of a single dose of LC15-0444 in healthy male subjects. Methods: A dose-block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single-dose, Phase I study was performed in healthy Korean male subjects assigned to receive 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 600 mg of LC15-0444 capsules. Blood and urine samples were collected up to 72 hours after administration. Plasma and urine drug concentrations were determined by tandem mass spectrometry coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography. DPP IV activity was measured by continuous spectrophotometric assay. An additional food effect study was performed in the 100-mg dose group; changes in PK and PD parameters after high-fat diet were evaluated. Adverse events (AEs) were detected through investigator inquiries, spontaneous reports, and clinical evaluations such as physical examinations, vital sign measurements, 12-lead electrocardiography, clinical laboratory tests (eg, hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis), and computerized impedance cardiography. Results: Sixty Korean men (mean age, 25.3 years [range, 19-39 years]; weight, 68.3 kg [range, 53.6-84.9 kg]) were enrolled, providing 10 subjects for each dose group. After administration, LC15-0444 reached T-max at 0.5 to 5.1 hours, and was eliminated with a t(1/2) of 16.7 to 21.3 hours. The mean fraction of unchanged drug excreted in urine ranged from 0.21 to 0.34 and mean renal clearance was w15.5 to 23.6 L/h. The dose-normalized AUC exhibited dose-linearity over the range of 50 to 400 mg. All doses of LC15-0444 >= 200 mg were found to inhibit 80% of DPP IV activity for 24 hours. High-fat diet did not significantly influence the AUC of LC15-0444. LC15-0444 was generally well tolerated. None of the subjects developed any serious clinical or laboratory AEs or discontinued the study due to an AE. All AEs were mild or moderate, and no dose-related trends were observed. Fortysix AEs were reported in 18 subjects (30.0%). AEs considered to be related to the study drug were headache (6 cases), dizziness (2), nausea (1), epistaxis (1), and increased heart rate (1). All AEs resolved spontaneously. Conclusions: A single dose of LC15-0444 exhibited linear PK properties over the range of 50 to 400 mg in these healthy Korean male subjects. PK characteristics were not significantly influenced by food. In addition, doses >= 200 mg of LC15-0444 inhibited plasma DPP IV activity by >80% over a 24-hour dosing interval, and a 600-mg dose increased active glucagon-likepeptide-1. levels after a standardized meal. LC15-0444 was generally well tolerated.

Previously, we provided evidence that there is a significant insoluble fibrin amyloid microclot load in the circulation of individuals with long COVID, and that these microclots entrap a substantial number of inflammatory molecules, including those that might prevent clot breakdown. Scientifically, the most challenging aspect of this debilitating condition is that traditional pathology tests such as a serum CRP (C-reactive protein) may not show any significant abnormal inflammatory markers, albeit these tests measure only the soluble inflammatory molecules. Elevated, or abnormal soluble biomarkers such as IL-6, D-Dimer or fibrinogen indicate an increased risk for thrombosis or a host immune response in COVID-19. The absence of biomarkers in standard pathology tests, result in a significant amount of confusion for patients and clinicians, as patients are extremely sick or even bed-ridden but with no regular identifiable reason for their disease. Biomarkers that are currently available cannot detect the molecules present in the microclots we identified and are therefore unable to confirm their presence or the mechanisms that drive their formation. Methods Here we analysed the protein content of double-digested microclots of 99 long COVID patients and 29 healthy controls. The patients suffering from long COVID reported their symptoms through a questionnaire completed by themselves or their attending physician. Results Our long COVID cohort's symptoms were found to be in line with global findings, where the most prevalent symptoms were constant fatigue (74%,) cognitive impairment (71%) and depression and anxiety (30%). Our most noteworthy findings were a reduced level of plasma Kallikrein compared to our controls, an increased level of platelet factor 4 (PF4) von Willebrand factor (VWF), and a marginally increased level of alpha-2 antiplasmin (alpha-2-AP). We also found a significant presence of antibodies entrapped inside these microclots. Conclusion Our results confirm the presence of pro-inflammatory molecules that may also contribute to a failed fibrinolysis phenomenon, which could possibly explain why individuals with long COVID suffer from chronic fatigue, dyspnoea, or cognitive impairment. In addition, significant platelet hyperactivation was noted. Hyperactivation will result in the granular content of platelets being shed into the circulation, including PF4. Overall, our results provide further evidence of both a failed fibrinolytic system in long COVID/PASC and the entrapment of many proteins whose presence might otherwise go unrecorded. These findings might have significant implications for individuals with pre-existing comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.;;"Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University; University of Liverpool; Novo Nordisk Foundation; Technical University of Denmark";;;;;;;;;;73;73;;;;;;;;;;;SEP 21;2022;21;1;;;;;;;190;10.1186/s12933-022-01623-4;http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12933-022-01623-4;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000857452600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods We adopted the diagnostic criteria for T2DM recommended by ADA for humans: FSG >= 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dl) and HbA1c >= 6.5%. The serum and feces samples from three diagnosed spontaneously T2DM cynomolgus monkeys and 11 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study.

Diabetic kidney disease is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease across the world. Early identification of DKD is vitally important for the effective prevention and control of it. However, the available indicators are doubtful in the early diagnosis of DKD. This study is aimed at determining novel sensitive and specific biomarkers to distinguish DKD from their counterparts effectively based on the widely targeted metabolomics approach. Materials and Method. This case-control study involved 44 T2DM patients. Among them, 24 participants with DKD were defined as the cases and another 20 without DKD were defined as the controls. The ultraperformance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry system was applied for the assessment of the serum metabolic profiles. Comprehensive analysis of metabolomics characteristics was conducted to detect the candidate metabolic biomarkers and assess their capability and feasibility. Result. A total of 11 differential metabolites, including Hexadecanoic Acid (C16:0), Linolelaidic Acid (C18:2N6T), Linoleic Acid (C18:2N6C), Trans-4-Hydroxy-L-Proline, 6-Aminocaproic Acid, L-Dihydroorotic Acid, 6-Methylmercaptopurine, Piperidine, Azoxystrobin Acid, Lysopc 20:4, and Cuminaldehyde, were determined as the potential biomarkers for the DKD early identification, based on the multivariable generalized linear regression model and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Conclusion. Serum metabolites might act as sensitive and specific biomarkers for DKD early detection.

Although the initial stage of DACD can lead to metabolic alterations or potential pathological changes, DACD is difficult to diagnose accurately. Moreover, the details of the molecular mechanism of DACD remain somewhat elusive. To understand the pathophysiological changes that underpin the development and progression of DACD, we carried out a global analysis of metabolic alterations in response to DACD. The metabolic alterations associated with DACD were first investigated in humans, using plasma metabonomics based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis. The related pathway of each metabolite of interest was searched in database online. The network diagrams were established KEGGSOAP software package. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of metabolites. This is the first report of reliable biomarkers of DACD, which were identified using an integrated strategy. The identified biomarkers give new insights into the pathophysiological changes and molecular mechanisms of DACD. The disorders of sphingolipids metabolism, bile acids metabolism, and uric acid metabolism pathway were found in T2DM and DACD. On the other hand, differentially expressed plasma metabolites offer unique metabolic signatures for T2DM and DACD patients. These are potential biomarkers for disease monitoring and personalized medication complementary to the existing clinical modalities.;;"Dalian Medical University; Dalian Medical University; Dalian University; Dalian University; Dalian Medical University; Dalian Medical University; Dalian Medical University; Dalian Medical University";;;;;;;;;;22;25;;;;;;;;;;;MAY 14;2015;10;5;;;;;;;e0126952;10.1371/journal.pone.0126952;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126952;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000354545600091;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this research, the effect of camel whey protein (CWP) on diabetic liver injury in T2DM rats (T2DM induced by a high-fat diet) and streptozotocin along with its possible mechanism were investigated by means of transcriptome and proteomics. The results demonstrated that CWP lowered fasting blood glucose and improved abnormal blood lipid profiles in T2DM rats. CWP reduced lipid accumulation, diminished oxidative stress, and effectively improved the pathological changes in the liver of T2DM rats. Further experiments indicated that CWP intake had adjusted mitochondrial dysfunction in the livers of T2DM rats and L -O2 cells induced by high glucose (HG)/palmitic acid (PA) by inhibiting alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semi-aldehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) expression. In conclusion, CWP can ameliorate diabetic liver injury in T2DM rats by inhibiting the expression of ACMSD, promote de novo NAD+ synthesis and enhance mitochondrial function.;;"Xinjiang University; Nankai University";;;;;;;;;;0;1;;;;;;;;;;;NOV;2023;110;;;;;;;;105835;10.1016/j.jff.2023.105835;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2023.105835;;OCT 2023;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:001105845300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The changes in endogenous metabolites in the plasma of high-fat diet-induced dyslipidemia rats treated with Ge Gen Qin Lian Decoction (GGQLD) were studied to elucidate the therapeutic effects and mechanism of action of GGQLD in dyslipidemia. Based on ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS), the metabolic profiles of rat serum samples were collected. The rat model of dyslipidemia was induced by a 60% fat-fed high-fat diet. After feeding the rats with a high-fat diet for 4 weeks, dyslipidemia appeared. After 5 weeks of GGQLD (14.85g kg(-1)) administration, the metabonomics of rats' plasma samples in the normal group, model group, and administration group were analyzed. Mass profiler professional (MPP), SIMCA-P 14.1, and Graphpad prism 6.0 software were used combined with METLIN biological database and human metabolite database HMDB to screen and identify endogenous biomarkers. Metaboanalyst 4.0 software was used by combining with HMDB and KEGG databases; the enrichment and metabolic pathway of biomarkers were analyzed to explore the metabolic mechanism of dyslipidemia rats induced by high-fat diet and the intervention mechanism of Gegen Qinlian decoction. After 5 weeks of administration of GGQLD, the levels of serum TC and TG were significantly decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01), while HDL-C and LDL-C were not significantly affected. After administration, the food intake of rats in the administration group decreased gradually, and the change trend of body weight gradually slowed down. The metabonomics of rat plasma samples results showed that 23 potential biomarkers including alpha -linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, and lysophosphatidylcholine were significantly changed in positive ion mode. Studies have shown that GGQLD has a significant lipid-lowering effect on dyslipidemia rats induced by a high-fat diet, and its preventive mechanism is related to tryptophan metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, alpha -linolenic acid metabolism, arachidonic acid, and glycerophosphatidyl metabolism pathway.";;;;;;;;;;;;11;11;;;;;;;;;;;JUN 7;2021;2021;;;;;;;;;10.1155/2021/6692456;http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/6692456;;;;;;;;;;;;;WOS:000722038100007;View Full Record in Web of Science

All participants underwent standard 7-field fundus photography and spectral-domain OCT. SS-OCTA was used for retinal and choriocapillaris imaging and 3 x 3-mm2 macular CC FD% was quantified. Univariate and multivariate logistic models were used to evaluate the association between CC FD% and 2 or more steps of DR progression and DME development. The ad-ditional predictive value of CC FD% for outcome events was assessed using C statistic, net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement index (IDI).center dot RESULTS: Over 3 years, 295 of 1805 eyes (16.34%) developed DR progression, and 118 eyes (6.54%) devel-oped DME. A higher average CC FD% was correlated with DR progression (odds ratio [OR], 3.41 per SD in-crease, 95% CI: 2.65-4.39, P < .001) and DME devel-opment (OR, 1.37 per SD increase, 95% CI: 1.06-1.77, P = .016) after adjusting for confounders. In the ET -DRS regions, increased CC FD% in all fields was associ-ated with DR progression; however, increased CC FD% in the inferior field was associated with DME develop-ment. Compared with the models based on established risk factors, the addition of average CC FD% significantly improved the C statistics for DR progression (0.712 to 0.777, P < .001) and DME occurrence (0.743 to 0.773, P = .044). The estimated NRIs and IDIs (all > 0) indi-cated that the addition of CC FD% led to a significant improvement in the discriminative performance for end points.center dot CONCLUSION: CC FD% is independently associated with DR progression and DME development in the Chi-nese T2DM population and provides incremental predic-tive value beyond traditional risk factors and retinal mi-crovascular parameters. Further inclusion of CC FD% in DR prediction models helps guide population-based screening and personalized management. (Am J Oph-thalmol 2023;248: 76-86. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

An individual's phenotype represents a complex interaction between the human genome and environmental factors during an individual's lifetime. This review explores the concept that there is a dynamic, two-way interaction between nutrition and the human genome which determines gene expression, the metabolic response and an individual's health status. It addresses the relevance of new high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic technologies within human nutrition research. Common, polygenic, diet-related diseases (CVD, obesity, T2DM, etc.) reflect multiple genetic variants interacting with numerous environmental factors, each combination making a relatively small contribution to overall cellular homeostasis, whole body metabolism and health. This review highlights the value of a nutrigenomics-based systems biology approach to understanding human nutrition and identifying new biomarkers of nutrition and health. The challenge will be to develop and apply robust nutritional genomics research initiatives that are sensitive enough to take account of both human genetic heterogeneity and diverse nutrient exposure. If nutrigenomic approaches enhance our understanding of human nutrition at the molecular level, then it may be possible to apply a more targeted and effective personalized nutrition approach to attenuate the effect of risk factors associated with diet-related diseases. Indeed it could be proposed that a personalized nutrition approach may assist in improving the effectiveness of dietary guidelines/recommendations in general.
