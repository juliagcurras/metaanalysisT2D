AB  - Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), also known as adult-onset diabetes or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Protein biomarker screening plays an essential role in different diseases. Proteomic methods such as MALDI-TOF based peptide mass fingerprinting, LC-MS/MS based peptide sequencing, and multidimensional liquid phase chromatography (MDLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS) shotgun proteomics are used to identify biomarkers. Methods In this study, we used a MDLC coupled with tandem MS shotgun proteomic method to demonstrate protein quantitation results by comparing human serum samples from T2DM patients with those of healthy subjects. We utilized quantitative techniques, dimethyl labeling, MDLC by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography separated column, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem MS to identify proteins with high potential to be T2DM biomarker candidates. Results Identified candidates included vitamin D-binding protein, apolipoprotein B-100, apolipoprotein A2, apolipoprotein A1, transthyretin, Ig heavy-chain V-III region BRO, antithrombin-3, fibrinogen gamma chains, fibrinogen alpha chains, and alpha-1-antitrypsin. In addition, we also generated relative protein networks using STRING bioinformatic software. Conclusion These potential biomarker candidates might be verified by further experiments such as an ELISA assay or multiple reaction monitoring MS screening.

AB  - The identification of biomarkers to noninvasively detect prediabetes/diabetes will facilitate interventions designed to prevent or delay progression to frank diabetes and its attendant complications. The purpose of this study was to characterize the human salivary proteome in type-2 diabetes to identify potential biomarkers of diabetes. Whole saliva from control and type-2 diabetic individuals was characterized by multidimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS). Label-free quantification was used to identify differentially abundant protein biomarkers. Selected potential biomarkers were then independently validated in saliva from control, diabetic, and prediabetic subjects by Western immunoblotting and ELISA. Characterization of the salivary proteome identified a total of 487 unique proteins. Approximately 33% of these have not been previously reported in human saliva. Of these, 65 demonstrated a greater than 2-fold difference in abundance between control and type-2 diabetes samples. A majority of the differentially abundant proteins belong to pathways regulating metabolism and immune response. Independent validation of a subset of potential biomarkers utilizing immunodetection confirmed their differential expression in type-2 diabetes, and analysis of prediabetic samples demonstrated a trend of relative increase in their abundance with progression from the prediabetic to the diabetic state. This comprehensive proteomic analysis of the human salivary proteome in type-2 diabetes provides the first global view of potential mechanisms perturbed in diabetic saliva and their utility in detection and monitoring of diabetes. Further characterization of these markers in a larger cohort of subjects may provide the basis for new, noninvasive tests for diabetes screening, detection, and monitoring.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes and tooth loss are linked both epidemiologically and pathophysiologically. We applied label-free differential protein expression analysis using multidimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) to explore the proteomic profile of saliva samples collected from selected type 2 diabetic edentulous patients and non-diabetic controls. Ninety-six peptides corresponding to 52 proteins were differentially expressed between the diabetic edentulous patients and controls (p < 0.05). Some diabetes-related inflammatory biomarkers including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and serum amyloid A were detected with levels increased in diabetic samples. Other biomarkers including amylase, palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated protein (PLUNC), and serotransferrin levels were decreased in diabetic samples. In contrast with previous findings, salivary carbonic anhydrase 6 and alpha-2 macroglobulin levels, however, were decreased in this diabetic patient population. Cluster analysis and principle component analysis demonstrated a differential pattern of protein biomarker expression between diabetic and control subjects. Western blot analysis was completed to confirm the relatively lower expression level of two biomarkers, including PLUNC and amylase in the diabetic group compared to control subjects. The presence of salivary biomarkers specific for diabetes in edentulous subjects mimics those in serum, especially those related to inflammatory/lipid metabolism. While this exploratory study requires further validation with a larger population, it provides proof-of-principle for salivary proteomics for edentulous subjects with diabetes.

AB  - Insulin resistance defines the metabolic syndrome and precedes, as well is the hallmark of, type II diabetes. Adipocytes, besides being a major site for energy storage, are endocrine in nature and secrete a variety of proteins, adipocytokines (adipokines), that can modulate insulin sensitivity, inflammation, obesity, hypertension, food intake (anorexigenic and orexigenic), and general energy homeostasis. Recent data demonstrates that increased intracellular glycosylation of proteins via O-GlcNAc can induce insulin resistance and that a rodent model with genetically elevated O-GlcNAc levels in muscle and fat displays hyperleptinemia. The link between O-GlcNAc levels, insulin resistance, and adipocytokine secretion is further explored here. First, with the use of immortalized and primary rodent adipocytes, the secreted proteome of differentiated adipocytes is more fully elucidated by the identification of 97 and 203 secreted proteins, respectively. Mapping of more than 80 Winked glycosylation sites on adipocytokines from the cell lines further defines this proteome. Importantly, adipocytokines that are modulated when cells are shifted from insulin responsive to insulin resistant conditions are determined. By the use of two protocols for inducing insulin resistance, classical hyperglycemia with chronic insulin exposure and pharmacological elevation of O-GlcNAc levels, several proteins are identified that are regulated in a similar fashion under both conditions including HCNP, Quiescin Q6, Angiotensin, lipoprotein lipase, matrix metalloproteinase 2, and slit homologue 3. Detection of these potential prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers for metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes, and the resulting complications of both diseases further establishes the central role of the O-GlcNAc modification of intracellular proteins in the pathophysiology of these conditions.

AB  - Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) intricately involves disrupted lipid metabolism. Exosomes emerge as carriers of biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring. This study aims to identify lipid metabolites in serum exosomes for T2DM diagnosis.Methods Serum samples were collected from newly diagnosed T2DM patients and age and body mass index-matched healthy controls. Exosomes were isolated using exosome isolation reagent, and untargeted/targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to identify and validate altered lipid metabolites. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of candidate lipid metabolites.Results Serum exosomes were successfully isolated from both groups, with untargeted LC-MS/MS revealing distinct lipid metabolite alterations. Notably, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (22:2(13Z,16Z)/14:0) showed stable elevation in T2DM-serum exosomes. Targeted LC-MS/MS confirmed significant increase of PE (22:2(13Z,16Z)/14:0) in T2DM exosomes but not in serum. PE (22:2(13Z,16Z)/14:0) levels not only positively correlated with hemoglobin A1C levels and blood glucose levels, but also effectively distinguished T2DM patients from healthy individuals (area under the curve = 0.9141).Conclusion Our research sheds light on the importance of serum exosome lipid metabolites in diagnosing T2DM, providing valuable insights into the complex lipid metabolism of diabetes.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an increasing global public health concern, but its impact on the salivary proteome is still unclear. To evaluate the effect of glycemic levels in middle-aged and elderly individuals with T2DM on salivary proteomics, we compared the differences by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Unstimulated whole saliva samples from 8 T2DM patients with good glycemic control (G group, HbA1c <6.5%) and 16 patients with poor control (P group, HbA1c >= 6.5%) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS in the data-independent acquisition mode (Clinical register number: ChiCTR1900023582.). After functional annotation, cluster analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were carried out to screen and evaluate candidate proteins. A total of 5,721 proteins were quantified, while 40 proteins differed significantly. In the P group, proteins involved in oxidative stress-related processes were upregulated, whereas proteins related to salivary secretion were downregulated. The combination of thioredoxin domain-containing protein 17, zymogen granule protein 16B, and FAM3 metabolism regulating signaling molecule D yielded an area under the curve of 0.917 which showed a robust ability to distinguish the P and G groups. In conclusion, poorly controlled hyperglycemia may affect salivary proteins through various pathways, including oxidative stress and glandular secretion. Furthermore, the differentially expressed proteins, especially the three proteins with the best differentiation, might serve as an anchor point for the further study of hyperglycemia and oral diseases.

AB  - Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) therapy requires early diagnosis and complication avoidance. Unfortunately, current diagnostic markers do not meet these needs. Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) offers a solution for clinical diagnosis, providing reliable and precise sample quantification. This study utilized DIA-MS to investigate proteomic differential expression in the serum of recently diagnosed T2DM patients. The study conducted a comparative protein expression analysis between healthy and recently diagnosed T2DM groups (discovery cohort). A candidate protein was then validated using enzyme-linked immune assay (ELISA) on serum samples collected from T2DM patients (n=87) and healthy control (n=60) (validation cohort). A total of 1074 proteins were identified, and 90 were significantly dysregulated between the two groups, including 32 newly associated with T2DM. Among these proteins, the expression of S100 calcium-binding protein A6 (S100A6) was validated by ELISA. It showed a significant increase in T2DM samples compared to the control group. It was evaluated as a biomarker using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, consistent with the DIA-MS results. Novel proteins are reported to be involved in the development and progression of T2DM. Further studies are required to investigate the differential expression of candidate marker proteins in a larger population of T2DM patients.

AB  - Background: Growing evidence has confirmed that populations with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increasing risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Thus, convenient and effective screening strategies for CRC should be developed for the T2DM population to increase the detection rate of CRC.Methods: Twenty serum samples extracted from five healthy participants, five T2DM patients, five CRC patients and five T2DM patients with CRC (T2DM + CRC) were submitted to data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) analysis to discover unique differentially altered proteins (DAPs) for CRC in patients with T2DM. Then, the diagnostic value of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) was validated by ELISA analysis in the validated cohort.Results: Based on DIA-MS analysis, we found eight unique proteins specific to T2DM patients with CRC. Among these proteins, four proteins showed different expression between the T2DM + CRC and T2DM groups, and PZP exhibited the largest difference. Next, the diagnostic value of serum PZP was validated by ELISA analysis with an AUC of 0.713. Moreover, the combination of PZP, CA199 and CEA exhibited encouraging diagnostic value, and the AUC reached 0.916.Conclusion: Overall, our current research implied that PZP could be regarded as a newfound serum biomarker for CRC medical diagnosis in T2DM patients.

AB  - Proteins differential expression in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be due to etiological factors or pathological changes, such proteins can be utilized as biomarkers. Identification of a marker protein out of thousands became a feasible task during the proteomics era by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In this study, blood samples were obtained from 80 Bahraini subjects with and without T2DM, a subset was used for proteomic analysis by LC-MS/MS, while all samples were used for ELISA analysis of 3 proteins, TATA-box binding protein-associated factor RNA polymerase-1-C (TAF1C), ceruloplasmin (CERP) and fibronectin (FN). The former 2 proteins were selected from the T2DM-protein-panel identified by LC-MS/MS, and the latter was analyzed for validation of the setting. The main findings of the proteomic analysis are i. Identifications of 62 differentially expressed proteins in T2DM, ii. Upregulation of 71% of the identified proteins. While the ELISA analysis showed that; both TAF1C and FN were significantly increased in T2DM (P0.015 and P0.001, respectively), while CERP was not (P0.088). Logistic regression analysis: i. confirmed the above associations after correction for covariates, ii. Revealed an interaction between age and gender that affect the association of the proteins with T2DM. In conclusion, knowing that TAF1C is a prerequisite in ribosomal biogenesis, our ELISA results are suggestive of increased protein synthesis in T2DM, explaining the observed upregulation of the proteins identified by LC-MSMS. The association between T2DM and TAF1C is a novel finding that might open a new avenue in DM research.

AB  - The early diagnosis of diabetes, one of the top three chronic incurable diseases, is becoming increasingly important. Here, we investigated the applicability of an O-18-labeling technique for the development of a standard-free, label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Rather than attempting to identify quantitative differences in proteins as biomarkers, glycation of the highest abundance protein in human plasma, human serum albumin (HSA), was monitored through quantitative analysis of HSA characteristic peptides using the O-18-labeling technique. Eight glucose-sensitive peptides and one glucose-insensitive peptide were discovered. The glucose-insensitive peptide served as the internal standard, and a standard-free, label-free LC-MS/MS method was developed. This method was then used to select putative biomarkers for T2DM in a clinical trial with 389 human plasma samples. As a result, three of the eight glucose-sensitive peptides (FKDLGEENFK, LDELRDEGK, and KVPQVSTPTLVEVSR) were selected and could be used as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of T2DM.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been recognized as one of the most important and independent risk factors for hepatocellular cancer (HCC). However, there is still a lack of ideal tumor markers for HCC detection in the T2DM population. Serum lipids have been revealed as potential tumor markers for HCC. In this study, our objective was to develop a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to detect several lipids including 8,15-dihydroxy-5,9,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (8,15-DiHETE), hexadecanedioic acid (HDA), 15-keto-13,14-dihydroprostaglandin A2 (DHK-PGA2), ricinoleic acid (RCL), octadecanedioic acid (OA) and 16-hydroxy hexadecanoic acid (16OHHA) in serum and explore their diagnostic potential for T2DM-positive [T2DM(+)] HCC. A robust LC-MS/MS method was established for the measurement of 8,15-DiHETE, HDA, DHK-PGA2, RCL, OA, and 16OHHA. The methodology validation was conducted, and the results suggested the reliability of this LC-MS/MS method for targeted lipids. Several serum lipids, including 8,15-DiHETE, HDA, DHK-PGA2, and OA were increased in T2DM(+) HCC patients. A biomarker signature that incorporated HDA, DHK-PGA2, and AFP was established and showed good diagnostic potential for T2DM(+) HCC, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.87 for diagnosing T2DM(+) HCC from T2DM individuals. Additionally, the biomarker signature diagnosed small-size (AUC = 0.88) and early-stage (AUC = 0.79) tumors with high efficacy. Moreover, the biomarker signature could differentiate T2DM(+) HCC from other T2DM(+) tumors, including pancreatic, gastric and colorectal cancer (AUC = 0.88) as well. In conclusion, our study develops a novel tool for early diagnosis of T2DM(+) HCC in T2DM patients.

AB  - Background Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increased risk of suffering from various malignancies. This study aimed to identify specific biomarkers that can detect lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) in T2DM patients for the early diagnosis of LAC. Methods The clinical information of hospitalized T2DM patients diagnosed with various cancers was collected by reviewing medical records in Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University from January 1, 2015, to June 30, 2020. To discover diagnostic biomarkers for early-stage LAC in the T2DM population, 20 samples obtained from 5 healthy controls, 5 T2DM patients, 5 LAC patients and 5 T2DM patients with LAC (T2DM + LAC) were subjected to sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectrum (SWATH-MS) analysis to identify specific differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs) for LAC in patients with T2DM. Then, these results were validated by parallel reaction monitoring MS (PRM-MS) and ELISA analyses. Results Lung cancer was the most common malignant tumor in patients with T2DM, and LAC accounted for the majority of cases. Using SWATH-MS analysis, we found 13 proteins to be unique in T2DM patients with early LAC. Two serum proteins were further validated by PRM-MS analysis, namely, pregnancy-zone protein (PZP) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). Furthermore, the diagnostic values of these proteins were validated by ELISA, and PZP was validated as a novel serum biomarker for screening LAC in T2DM patients. Conclusions Our findings indicated that PZP could be used as a novel serum biomarker for the identification of LAC in T2DM patients, which will enhance auxiliary diagnosis and assist in the selection of surgical treatment at an early stage.

AB  - Protein carbonylation is a common nonenzymatic oxidative post-translational modification, which is often considered as biomarker of oxidative stress. Recent evidence links protein carbonylation also to obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), though the protein targets of carbonylation in human plasma have not been identified. In this study, we profiled carbonylated proteins in plasma samples obtained from lean individuals and obese patients with or without T2DM. The plasma samples were digested with trypsin, carbonyl groups were derivatized with O-(biotinylcarbazoylmethyl)hydroxylamine, enriched by avidin affinity chromatography, and analyzed by RPC-MS/MS. Signals of potentially modified peptides were targeted in a second LC-MS/MS analysis to retrieve the peptide sequence and the modified residues. A total of 158 unique carbonylated proteins were identified, of which 52 were detected in plasma samples of all three groups. Interestingly, 36 carbonylated proteins were detected only in obese patients with T2DM, whereas 18 were detected in both nondiabetic groups. The carbonylated proteins originated mostly from liver, plasma, platelet, and endothelium. Functionally, they were mainly involved in cell adhesion, signaling, angiogenesis, and cytoskeletal remodeling. Among the identified carbonylated proteins were several candidates, such as VEGFR-2, MMP-1, argin, MKK4, and compliment C5, already connected before to diabetes, obesity and metabolic diseases.

AB  - Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) followed by multivariate statistical analysis has been successfully applied to the plasma phospholipids metabolic profiling in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2). Principal components analysis and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were tested and compared in class separation between the DM2 and control. The application of an orthogonal signal correction filtered model highly improved the class distinction and predictive power of PLS-DA models. Additionally, unit variance scaling was also tested. With this methodology, it was possible not only to differentiate the DM2 from the control but also to discover and identify the potential biomarkers with LC/MS/MS. The proposed method shows that LC/MS combining with multivariate statistical analysis is a complement or an alternative to NMR for metabonomics applications.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been identified as an independent risk factor for hepatocellular cancer (HCC). However, there are no ideal biomarkers for the surveillance and early detection of HCC in the T2DM population at present. In this study, we aimed to explore novel metabolite biomarkers for T2DM-positive [T2DM(+)] HCC by metabolomic analysis. At first, many serum metabolites were found dysregulated in T2DM(+) HCC patients in untargeted metabolomic analyses. Targeted metabolite analyses confirmed that serum benzoic acid and citrulline were increased, and creatine was decreased in T2DM(+) HCC compared to the T2DM group. A metabolite classifier including benzoic acid, creatine, and citrulline was identified as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of T2DM(+) HCC, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.93 for discriminating T2DM(+) HCC patients from T2DM patients. In addition, the metabolite classifier detected small-size (AUC = 0.94), early-stage (AUC = 0.94), and AFP-negative (AUC = 0.96) tumors with high sensitivity and specificity. The combination of this metabolite classifier and AFP might be useful in the surveillance and early detection of HCC in the T2DM population. In conclusion, this study establishes a novel diagnostic tool for T2DM(+) HCC.

AB  - Background: This study assessed the alternations of kynurenine pathway (KP) and neopterin in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and explored possible differential metabolites. Methods: A fresh residual sera panel was collected from 80 healthy control (HC) individuals and 72 T2DM patients. Metabolites/ratios of interest including tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), kynurenic acid (KA), xanthurenic acid (XA), neopterin (NEO), KA/KYN ratio and KYN/TRP ratio were determined using a targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics approach, and the difference between groups was assessed. Supervised orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis and differential metabolite screening with fold change (FC) were performed to identify distinct biomarkers. The diagnostic performance of KP metabolites in T2DM was evaluated. Results: Significant decreases of TRP, 5HT, KA, XA, and KA/KYN and increases of KYN/TRP and NEO in T2DM compared to HC group were observed (P < 0.05). The KP metabolites panel significantly changed between T2DM and HC groups (Q(2): 0.925, P < 0.005). 5HT (FC: 0.63, P < 0.01) and NEO (FC: 3.27, P < 0.01) were proven to be distinct differential metabolites. A combined testing of fasting plasma glucose and KYN/TRP showed good value in the prediction of T2DM (AUC: 0.904, 95% CI 0.843-0.947). Conclusions: The targeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics study is a powerful tool for evaluating the status of T2DM. This study facilitated the application of KP metabolomics into future clinical practice. 5HT and NEO are promising biomarkers in T2DM. KYN/TRP was highly associated with the development of T2DM and may serve as a potential treatment target.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a disease associated with a number of metabolic disturbances, including protein metabolism. In the present study, blood samples were obtained from Bahraini subjects, including 6 patients with T2DM and 6 age- and sex-matched, non-diabetic, healthy controls. Depleted and non-depleted sera were prepared from the collected blood, and the global protein expression changes were evaluated by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Only significantly and markedly differentially-expressed proteins (P<0.05, analysis of variance; maximum fold change >= 1.5) were considered as candidate proteins for informatics analysis. Accordingly, a total of 62 proteins were identified to be differentially expressed in T2DM, compared with control subjects, and they were grouped functionally into 16 classes of proteins. The largest class was that of the immune-associated proteins. Additionally, similar to 25 of these proteins (40%) had previously been associated with DM; however, the association of the other 37 proteins with T2DM was a novel observation. The majority of the identified proteins were upregulated in T2DM. The identified proteins could be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease or serve as disease biomarkers. Further validation of the identified proteins in a large study cohort is required, in order to fully access their potential clinical usefulness.

AB  - Metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are alarming health burdens around the world, while therapies for these diseases are far from satisfying as their etiologies are not completely clear yet. T2DM, NAFLD, and MetS are all complex and multifactorial metabolic disorders based on the interactions between genetics and environment. Omics studies such as genetics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics, and metabolomics are all promising approaches in accurately characterizing these diseases. And the most effective treatments for individuals can be achieved via omics pathways, which is the theme of precision medicine. In this review, we summarized the multi-omics studies of T2DM, NAFLD, and MetS in recent years, provided a theoretical basis for their pathogenesis and the effective prevention and treatment, and highlighted the biomarkers and future strategies for precision medicine.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients are at significant risk of cardiovascular disease, however, the pathophysiology of these complications is complex and incompletely known in this population. The aim of this study was to compare the serum proteome of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus presenting or not presenting cardiovascular disease with non-diabetic subjects to find essential proteins related to these cardiovascular complications. This cross-sectional study compares the serum proteome by a combination of protein depletion with 2D-DIGE (2-dimension Difference Gel Electrophoresis) methodology. The proteins differentially expressed were identified by MALDI TOF/TOF (Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and Time-Of-Flight ion detector) or LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass-Mass Spectrometry). Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with cardiovascular disease showed higher expression of plasma retinol binding protein and glutathione peroxidase-3 compared to those without cardiovascular disease and non-diabetic controls. These results show that proteins related to the inflammatory and redox state appear to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the cardiovascular disease in the type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.

AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize the proteome of the corneal endothelial cell layer and its basement membrane (Descemet membrane) in humans with various severities of type II diabetes mellitus compared to controls, and identify differentially expressed proteins across a range of diabetic disease severities that may influence corneal endothelial cell health. Endothelium-Descemet membrane complex tissues were peeled from transplant suitable donor corneas. Protein fractions were isolated from each sample and subjected to multidimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Peptide spectra were matched to the human proteome, assigned gene ontology, and grouped into protein signaling pathways unique to each of the disease states. We identified an average of 12,472 unique proteins in each of the endothelium-Descemet membrane complex tissue samples. There were 2,409 differentially expressed protein isoforms that included previously known risk factors for type II diabetes mellitus related to metabolic processes, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that diabetes progression has many protein footprints related to metabolic processes, binding, and catalysis. The most represented pathways involved in diabetes progression included mitochondrial dysfunction, cell-cell junction structure, and protein synthesis regulation. This proteomic dataset identifies novel corneal endothelial cell and Descemet membrane protein expression in various stages of diabetic disease. These findings give insight into the mechanisms involved in diabetes progression relevant to the corneal endothelium and its basement membrane, prioritize new pathways for therapeutic targeting, and provide insight into potential biomarkers for determining the health of this tissue.

AB  - PurposeTear fluid biomarkers may offer a non-invasive strategy for detecting diabetic patients with increased risk of developing diabetic retinopathy (DR) or increased disease progression, thus helping both improving diagnostic accuracy and understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. Here, we assessed the tear fluid of nondiabetic individuals, diabetic patients with no DR, and diabetic patients with nonproliferative DR (NPDR) or with proliferative DR (PDR) to find putative biomarkers for the diagnosis and staging of DR. MethodsTear fluid samples were collected using Schirmer test strips from a cohort with 12 controls and 54 Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) patients, and then analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS)-based shotgun proteomics and bead-based multiplex assay. Tear fluid-derived small extracellular vesicles (EVs) were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, Western Blotting, and nano tracking. ResultsProteomics analysis revealed that among the 682 reliably quantified proteins in tear fluid, 42 and 26 were differentially expressed in NPDR and PDR, respectively, comparing to the control group. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD033101. By multicomparison analyses, we also found significant changes in 32 proteins. Gene ontology (GO) annotations showed that most of these proteins are associated with oxidative stress and small EVs. Indeed, we also found that tear fluid is particularly enriched in small EVs. T2D patients with NPDR have higher IL-2/-5/-18, TNF, MMP-2/-3/-9 concentrations than the controls. In the PDR group, IL-5/-18 and MMP-3/-9 concentrations were significantly higher, whereas IL-13 was lower, compared to the controls. ConclusionsOverall, the results show alterations in tear fluid proteins profile in diabetic patients with retinopathy. Promising candidate biomarkers identified need to be validated in a large sample cohort.

AB  - ObjectiveThis study aimed to compare the salivary protein profile in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) and periodontitis and their respective controls.MethodsEighty participants were included in the study. The four groups were formed by individuals with DM2 and periodontitis (DM2 + P, n = 20), DM2 without periodontitis (DM2, n = 20), periodontitis without DM2 (P, n = 20) and individuals without periodontitis and without DM2 (H, n = 20). Periodontal clinical examinations were performed and unstimulated saliva was collected. Proteomic analysis was performed by shotgun mass spectrometry. The results were obtained by searching the Homo sapiens database of the UniProt catalog.ResultsA total of 220 proteins were identified in saliva samples. In the comparison between DM2 + P and DM2 groups, 27 proteins were up-regulated [e.g. S100-A8 was 6 times up-regulated (humoral immune response pathway)]. The DM2 + P and P groups had 26 up-regulated proteins [e.g. Immunoglobulin lambda constant 7 more than 2 times up-regulated (complement activation pathway)]. The non-DM2 groups (P and H) presented 22 up-regulated proteins [e.g. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase more than 2 times up-regulated (Peptidyl-cysteine S-nitrosylation pathway)]. The groups without periodontitis (DM2 and H) showed 23 were up-regulated proteins [e.g. Hemoglobin subunit alpha that was more than 10 times up-regulated (cellular oxidant detoxification pathway)].ConclusionThe presence of DM2 and periodontitis significantly impacts the salivary proteome. Our proteomic analysis demonstrated that changes in the S100 family proteins (S100A8 and S100 A9) are highly related to the presence of DM2 and periodontitis.Clinical relevanceDiabetes Mellitus (DM) and periodontitis are highly prevalent chronic diseases that present a wide variety of signs and symptoms. They present a bidirectional relationship, where patients with DM have a higher prevalence and severity of periodontitis, and patients with periodontitis have a higher prevalence of DM, worse glycemic control, and more diabetic complications. Diagnosing periodontitis requires specific clinical examinations, which require a highly trained operator. In this study, we used high throughput proteomics in order to evaluate non-invasive biomarkers for periodontitis in type 2 DM subjects. The results can contribute to earlier, more accurate, and less costly diagnosis of periodontitis in diabetic subjects, enabling better diabetes control.

AB  - Aims/IntroductionTo identify candidate serum molecules associated with the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus, differential serum proteomic analysis was carried out on a spontaneous animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus without obesity, the Long-Evans Agouti (LEA) rat.
   Materials and MethodsWe carried out quantitative proteomic analysis using serum samples from 8- and 16-week-old LEA and control Brown Norway (BN) rats (n = 4/group). Differentially expressed proteins were validated by multiple reaction monitoring analysis using the sera collected from 8-, 16-, and 24-week-old LEA (n = 4/each group) and BN rats (n = 5/each group). Among the validated proteins, we also examined the possible relevance of the human homolog of serine protease inhibitor A3 (SERPINA3) to type 2 diabetes mellitus.
   ResultsThe use of 2-D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis analysis and the following liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring analysis showed that the serum levels of five proteins were differentially changed between LEA rats and BN rats at all three time-points examined. Among the five proteins, SERPINA3N was increased significantly in the sera of LEA rats compared with age-matched BN rats. The serum level of SERPINA3 was also found to be significantly higher in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients than in healthy control participants. Furthermore, glycated hemoglobin, fasting insulin and estimated glomerular filtration rate were independently associated with the SERPINA3 levels.
   ConclusionsThese findings suggest a possible role for SERPINA3 in the development of the early stages of type 2 diabetes mellitus, although further replication studies and functional investigations regarding their role are required.

AB  - Introduction: The onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is strongly associated with obesity and subsequent perturbations in immuno-metabolic responses. To understand the complexity of these systemic changes and better monitor the health status of people at risk, validated clinical biomarkers are needed. Omics technologies are increasingly applied to measure the interplay of genes, proteins and metabolites in biological systems, which is imperative in understanding molecular mechanisms of disease and selecting the best possible molecular biomarkers for clinical use. Areas covered: This review describes the complex onset of T2DM, the contribution of obesity and adipose tissue inflammation to the T2DM disease mechanism, and the output of current biomarker strategies. A new biomarker approach is described that combines published and new self-generated data to merge multiple -omes (i.e. genome, proteome, metabolome etc.) toward understanding of mechanism of disease on the individual level and design multiparameter biomarker panels that drive significant impacts on personalized healthcare. Expert commentary: We here propose an approach to use cross-omics analyses to contextualize published biomarker data and better understand molecular mechanisms of health and disease. This will improve the current and future innovation gaps in translation of discovered putative biomarkers to clinically applicable biomarker tests.

AB  - Similar to dementia, the risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increases with age, and T2DM also increases the risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although T2DM is primarily a peripheral disorder and AD is a central nervous system disease, both share some common features as they are chronic and complex diseases, and both show involvement of oxidative stress and inflammation in their progression. These characteristics suggest that T2DM may be associated with AD, which gave rise to a new term, type 3 diabetes (T3DM). In this study, we searched for matching peripheral proteomic biomarkers of AD and T2DM based in a systematic review of the available literature. We identified 17 common biomarkers that were differentially expressed in both patients with AD or T2DM when compared with healthy controls. These biomarkers could provide a useful workflow for screening T2DM patients at risk to develop AD.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the salivary proteins that are associated with periodontitis in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Volunteers for the study were patients from the Diabetic Unit, University of Malaya Medical Centre, whose periodontal status was determined. The diabetic volunteers were divided into two groups, i.e., patients with periodontitis and those who were periodontally healthy. Saliva samples were collected and treated with 10% TCA/acetone/20 mM DTT to precipitate the proteins, which were then separated using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel images were scanned using the GS-800 (TM) Calibrated Densitometer. The protein spots were analyzed and expressed in percentage volumes. The percentage volume of each protein spot was subjected to Mann-Whitney statistical analysis using SPSS software and false discovery rate correction. When the expression of the salivary proteins was compared between the T2DM patients with periodontitis with those who were periodontally healthy, seven proteins, including polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, plastin-2, actin related protein 3, leukocyte elastase inhibitor, carbonic anhydrases 6, immunoglobulin J and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, were found to be differentially expressed (p < 0.01304). This implies that the proteins may have the potential to be used as biomarkers for the prediction of T2DM patients who may be prone to periodontitis.

AB  - Bariatric surgery (BS) results in metabolic pathway recalibration. We have identified potential biomarkers in plasma of people achieving type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remission after BS. Longitudinal analysis was performed on plasma from 10 individuals following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n = 7) or sleeve gastrectomy (n = 3). Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) was done on samples taken at 4 months before (baseline) and 6 and 12 months after BS. Four hundred sixty-seven proteins were quantified by SWATH-MS. Principal component analysis resolved samples from distinct time points after selection of key discriminatory proteins: 25 proteins were differentially expressed between baseline and 6 months post-surgery; 39 proteins between baseline and 12 months. Eight proteins (SHBG, TF, PRG4, APOA4, LRG1, HSPA4, EPHX2 and PGLYRP) were significantly different to baseline at both 6 and 12 months post-surgery. The panel of proteins identified as consistently different included peptides related to insulin sensitivity (SHBG increase), systemic inflammation (TF and HSPA4-both decreased) and lipid metabolism (APOA4 decreased). We found significant changes in the proteome for eight proteins at 6- and 12-months post-BS, and several of these are key components in metabolic and inflammatory pathways. These may represent potential biomarkers of remission of T2DM.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder that severely affects human health, but the pathogenesis of the disease remains unknown. The high-fat/high-sucrose diets combined with streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced nonhuman primate animal model of diabetes are a valuable research source of T2DM. Here, we present a study of a STZ rhesus macaque model of T2DM that utilizes quantitative iTRAQ-based proteomic method. We compared the protein profiles in the liver of STZ-treated macaques as well as age-matched healthy controls. We identified 171 proteins differentially expressed in the STZ-treated groups, about 70 of which were documented as diabetes-related gene in previous studies. Pathway analyses indicated that the biological functions of differentially expressed proteins were related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, complements, and coagulation cascades. Expression change in tryptophan metabolism pathway was also found in this study which may be associations with diabetes. This study is the first to explore genome-wide protein expression in hepatic tissue of diabetes macaque model using HPLC-Q-TOF/MS technology. In addition to providing potential T2DM biomarkers, this quantitative proteomic study may also shed insights regarding the molecular pathogenesis of T2DM.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers of diabetic vascular dementia (DVD) and unravel the underlying mechanisms using mass spectrometry (MS).
   Methods: Label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomic analysis was applied to urine samples from four groups, including 14 patients with vascular dementia (VD), 22 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 12 patients with DVD, and 21 normal controls (NCs). Searching the MS data by Proteome Discoverer software (ThermoFisher Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA), protein abundances were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively and compared between these groups. Combining bioinformatics analysis using Gene Ontology (GO), pathway crosstalk analysis using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using STRING, and literature searching, the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of DVD can be comprehensively judged and were further quantified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve methods.
   Results: The proteomic findings showed quantitative changes in patients with DVD compared to patients with NC, T2DM, and VD groups; among 4,744 identified urine proteins, 1,222, 1,152, and 1,180 proteins displayed quantitative changes unique to DVD vs. NC, T2DM, and VD, respectively, including 481 overlapped common DEPs. Then, nine unique proteins [including HP, SERPIND, ATP5PB, VNN2, ALDH3A1, U2AF2, C6, A0A5C2GRG5 (no name), and A0A5C2FZ29 (no name)] and two composite markers (CM) (A0A5C2GRG5+U2AF2 and U2AF2+C6) were confirmed by a ROC curve method.
   Conclusion: This study provided an insight into the potential pathogenesis of DVD and elucidated a method for early detection.

AB  - ObjectivesDue to the variety of modern diet and lifestyle changes, China has become the world's largest number of people with T2DM. How to prevent and cure T2DM has become one of the urgent public health events in China. Numerous studies have demonstrated vitamin D (VitD) was independently correlated with insulin sensitivity and beta cells function. VitD deficiency occurs in about 70% to 80% of patients with T2DM. However, the reason of T2DM patients suffering from VitD deficiency is not very clear. The aim of this project is to identify biomarkers to explore potential mechanism of VitD deficiency in patients with T2DM.MethodsWe used the iTRAQ-coupled LC-MS/MS technique to screen differential expression proteins between VitD deficiency group and VitD sufficiency group in T2DM patients. Then we carried out hierarchical clustering analysis, Gene Ontology classification and enrichment analysis, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network (PPI) analysis and ELISA validation.ResultsWe identified 63 differentially expressed proteins, 17 proteins were up-regulated and 46 proteins were down-regulated (VitD sufficiency vs. VitD deficiency). We ultimately selected four proteins, Podocalyxin (PODXL), ICAM3, MMP9, ApoF for further verification. As a result, the level of MMP9 and ICAM3 was higher in VitD sufficiency group than VitD deficiency group.ConclusionsOur study provided a solid theoretical foundation for the study of biomarkers and their mechanisms in most patients with T2DM who suffer from vitamin D deficiency. In addition, MMP9 and ICAM3 may play critical roles in the process of VitD deficiency in T2DM.

AB  - Metabolic disorders in T2DM generate multiple sources of free radicals and oxidative stress that accelerate nonenzymatic degenerative protein modifications (DPMs) such as protein oxidation, disrupt redox signaling and physiological function, and remain a major risk factor for clinical diabetic vascular complications. In order to identify potential oxidative biomarkers in the blood plasma of patients with T2DM, we used LC-MS/MS-based proteomics to profile plasma samples from patients with T2DM and healthy controls. The results showed that human serum albumin (HSA) is damaged by irreversible cysteine trioxidation, which can be a potential oxidative stress biomarker for the early diagnosis of T2DM. The quantitative detection of site-specific thiol trioxidation is technically challenging; thus, we developed a sensitive and selective LC-MS/MS workflow that has been used to discover and quantify three unique thiol-trioxidized HSA peptides, ALVLIAFAQYLQQC((SO3H))PFEDHVK (m/z 1241.13), YIC((SO3H))ENQDSISSK (m/z 717.80) and RPC((SO3H))FSALEVDETYVPK (m/z 951.45), in 16 individual samples of healthy controls (n=8) and individuals with diabetes (n=8). Targeted quantitative analysis using multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry revealed impairment of the peptides with m/z 1241.13, m/z 717.80 and m/z 951.45, with significance (P<0.02, P<0.002 and P<0.03), in individuals with diabetes. The results demonstrated that a set of three HSA thiol-trioxidized peptides, which are irreversibly oxidatively damaged in HSA in the plasma of patients with T2DM, can be important indicators and potential biomarkers of oxidative stress in T2DM.

AB  - Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common lifestyle disease affecting all countries. Due to its asymptomatic onset, it is often diagnosed after irreversible vascular complications have been initiated. Therefore, specific markers characteristic for very early disease stages and suitable for early diagnostics are required. Glycation of plasma proteins, such as human serum albumin (HSA), has been often suggested as marker. However, the total glycation degree of HSA does not provide sufficient information about short-term fluctuations of blood glucose concentrations due to the large number of glycation sites. Analysis of individual modification sites might be more informative, but methods for reliable quantifications are still missing.
   Objective: The main objective of this study was to establish and qualify a method of analysis applicable to sensitive and precise quantification of glycations sites in plasma proteins.
   Methods: Plasma samples obtained from diabetic patients and non-diseased individuals were separated from low-molecular weight compounds, digested with trypsin, enriched for glycated peptides by boronic acid affinity chromatography (BAC), desalted by solid phase extraction (SPE), and separated by RP-HPLC coupled online to ESI-QqQ-MS. Quantification relied on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of multiple glycation sites identified in plasma proteins using a stable isotope dilution approach or internal standardization.
   Results: The data presented here suggests high selectivity and precision (relative standard deviations below 10%) of the overall approach appearing to be well suited for the identification of prospective biomarkers. Six glycated peptides corresponding to different glycation sites of HSA were present in plasma samples obtained from T2DM patients at significantly higher levels than in non-diabetic men matched for age. Additionally, each of the studied glycation site of HSA appeared to be affected at different degrees.
   Conclusion: The presented approach enables the sensitive and robust quantification of prospective T2D biomarkers promising for clinical diagnostics.

AB  - Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex, pandemic disease contributing towards the global burden of health issues. To date, there are no simple clinical tests for the early detection of T2DM.
   Method: To identify potential peptide biomarkers for such applications, 406 sera of T2DM patients (n = 206) and healthy controls (n = 200) are analyzed by using MALDI-TOF MS with a cross-sectional case-control design.
   Result: Six peptides (peaks m/z 1452.9, 1692.8, 1946.0, 2115.1, 2211.0 and 4053.6) are identified as candidate biomarkers for T2DM. A diagnostic model constructed with six peptides is able to discriminate T2DM patients from healthy controls, with an accuracy of 82.20%, sensitivity of 82.50%, and specificity of 77.80% in the validation set. Peptide peaks m/z 1452.9 and 1692.8 are identified as fragments of the complement C3f, while peptide peaks m/z 1946.0, 2115.1, and 2211.0 are identified as the fragments of kininogen 1 isoform 1 precursor.
   Conclusion: This study reinforces proteomic analyses as a potential technique for defining significant clinical peptide biomarkers, providing a simple and convenient diagnostic model for T2DM in clinical examination.

AB  - Tryptophan (TRP) metabolites have been identified as potent biomarkers for complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, it remains unclear whether the therapeutic effect of metformin in T2DM is related to the modulation of TRP metabolic pathway. This study aims to investigate whether metformin affects TRP metabolism in T2DM mice through the gut microbiota. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was established to determine 16 TRP metabolites in the serum, colon content, urine, and feces of T2DM mice, and the correlations between metabolites and the T2DM mice gut microbiota were performed. The method demonstrated acceptable linearity (R-2 > 0.996), with the limit of quantification ranging from 0.29 to 69.444 nmol/L for 16 analytes, and the limit of detection ranging from 0.087 to 20.833 nmol/L. In T2DM mice, metformin treatment effectively restored levels of indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), and the ILA/IPA ratio, along with several aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands in the serum, with a notable impact in the colon but not in the urine. This restoration was accompanied by a shift in the relative abundance of Dubosiella, Turicibacter, RF39, Clostridia_UCG-014, and Alistipes. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed positive correlations between Turicibacter and Alistipes with IPA and indole-3-acetic acid. Conversely, these genera displayed negative correlations with ILA and kynurenine. In addition, our study revealed the presence of endogenous indole pathway in germ-free mice, and the impact of metformin on endogenous TRP metabolism in T2DM mice cannot be disregarded. Further research is needed to investigate the regulation of TRP metabolism by metformin.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disease with multiple etiologies, involving both genetic and environmental factors. With changes associated with modern life, increasing attention has been paid to chronic psychological stressors such as work stress. Chronic psychological stress can induce or aggravate diabetes mellitus, and conversely, with the deterioration of T2DM, patients often experience different degrees of depression, anxiety, and other negative emotions. In order to clarify the role of ZiBuPiYin recipe (ZBPYR) in regulating the liver mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteome to improve T2DM with chronic psychological stress, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified among Zucker lean littermates (control group), chronic psychological stress T2DM rats (model group), and ZBPYR administration rats (ZBPYR group) through iTRAQ with LC-MS/MS. Using Mfuzz soft clustering analysis, DEPs were divided into six different clusters. Clusters 1-6 contained 5, 68, 44, 57, 28, and 32 DEPs, respectively. Given that ZBPYR can alleviate T2DM symptoms and affect exploratory behavior during T2DM with chronic psychological stress, we focused on the clusters with opposite expression trends between model:control and ZBPYR:model groups. We screened out the DEPs in clusters 1, 3, and 4, which may be good candidates for the prevention and treatment of T2DM with chronic psychological stress, and further conducted bioinformatics analyses. DEPs were mainly involved in the insulin signaling pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid metabolism, lysosome-related processes, and lipid metabolism. This may indicate the pathogenic basis of T2DM with chronic psychological stress and the potential therapeutic mechanism of ZBPYR. In addition, two key proteins, lysosome-associated protein (Lamp2) and tricarboxylic acid cycle-related protein (Suclg1), may represent novel biomarkers for T2DM with chronic psychological stress and drug targets of ZBPYR. Western blot analyses also showed similar expression patterns of these two proteins in liver MAMs of the model and ZBPYR groups.

AB  - Globally, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common metabolic disorders. T2DM physiopathology is influenced by complex interrelationships between genetic, metabolic and lifestyle factors (including diet), which differ between populations and geographic regions. In fact, excessive consumptions of high fat/high sugar foods generally increase the risk of developing T2DM, whereas habitual intakes of plant-based healthy diets usually exert a protective effect. Moreover, genomic studies have allowed the characterization of sequence DNA variants across the human genome, some of which may affect gene expression and protein functions relevant for glucose homeostasis. This comprehensive literature review covers the impact of gene-diet interactions on T2DM susceptibility and disease progression, some of which have demonstrated a value as biomarkers of personal responses to certain nutritional interventions. Also, novel genotype-based dietary strategies have been developed for improving T2DM control in comparison to general lifestyle recommendations. Furthermore, progresses in other omics areas (epigenomics, metagenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) are improving current understanding of genetic insights in T2DM clinical outcomes. Although more investigation is still needed, the analysis of the genetic make-up may help to decipher new paradigms in the pathophysiology of T2DM as well as offer further opportunities to personalize the screening, prevention, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of T2DM through precision nutrition.

AB  - Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are at increased risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study, we attempted to list the proteomic biomarkers of PCOS and T2DM that have been published in the literature so far. We identified eight common biomarkers that were differentially expressed in both women with PCOS and T2DM when compared with healthy controls. These include pyruvate kinase M1/M2, apolipoprotein A-I, albumin, peroxiredoxin 2, annexin A2, alpha-1-B-glycoprotein, flotillin-1 and haptoglobin. These biomarkers could help improve our understanding of the links between PCOS and T2DM and could be potentially used to identify subgroups of women with PCOS at increased risk of T2DM. More studies are required to further evaluate the role these biomarkers play in women with PCOS and T2DM. European Journal of Endocrinology 168 R33-R43

AB  - Aims: To seek urinary peptides as biomarkers distinguishing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients from healthy controls.
   Methods: Random urine samples obtained from 28 patients with T2DM and 29 healthy individuals were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) after purification using weak cationic-exchange magnetic beads (MB-WCX). Then the generated mass spectra of peptides were analyzed by ClinProTools2.1 bioinformatics software. Subsequently, the amino acid sequences of differently expressed peptides were identified by a nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and a Sequest search found the corresponding protein name.
   Results: Three differently expressed peptides and their mass to charge ratios (m/z) were found. Compared with healthy controls, the peak areas of the three differently expressed peptides were all reduced in T2DM, and the m/z were 1056.1 (m/z), 1963.5 (m/z), 2123.5 (m/z), respectively. The above-mentioned peptides were further identified as fragments of histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1), bifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), and clusterin precursor protein (CLU).
   Conclusions: Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1, bifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, and clusterin precursor protein may serve as potential biomarkers distinguishing type 2 diabetes mellitus patients from healthy controls. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim/Introduction: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most frequent and widespread disease in the world.Obesity is the most significant predictor of T2DM, but the exact mechanism how obesity promotes T2DM remains unknown. Finding specific biomarkers to assist in diagnosing and treating patients with obese and T2DM is critical. Materials and Methods: We collected liver tissues from obesity patients with and without T2DM for proteomic sequencing and immunohistochemistry assay. Analysis Gene Ontology(GO) enrichment, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG), and protein interaction network (PPI) were performed on the parameters and data derived from the Tandem Mass Tags(TMT)-based proteomics analysis of liver tissues. Transcriptome data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO)website and genes that are deferentially expressed in both transcriptome and proteome were selected. Results: We identified 140 deferentially expressed proteins from proteomic sequencing. Six biomarkers were deferentially expressed in both proteome and transcriptome with consistent changes in direction. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis suggested CMPK1, the expression with greatest difference, was the core protein among the six biomarkers. Immunohistochemistry validated CMPK1 was upregulated significantly in the liver tissues of T2DM patients. The correlation analysis revealed that the expression of CMPK1 was significantly associated with key molecules in T2DM-related pathways at both protein and transcriptome levels. Conclusion and Novelty: Our study showed CMPK1 was upregulated in the liver of T2DM patients and provides a possible new target for screening and diagnosing T2DM in patients with obese and a novel theoretical basis for the pathophysiological mechanism of obesity-related metabolic diseases.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disease of the brain leading to the irreversible loss of neurons and intellectual abilities. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. The prevalence of AD and T2DM is increasing at an alarming rate and has become a major public health concern worldwide. The clinico-pathological relationship between AD and T2DM has been debated for more than a decade. Recent epidemiological studies have provided direct evidence that T2DM is a strong risk factor for AD and numerous studies have demonstrated that patients with diabetes have an increased risk of developing AD as compared with healthy individuals. The underlying biological mechanisms that link the development of diabetes with AD are not fully understood and therefore are worth intensive research. The existence of proteomic links between AD and diabetes is an important topic currently under active debate. An understanding of the complex association between diabetes and AD is necessary for the development of novel drug therapies and lifestyle guidelines aimed at the treatment and/or prevention of these diseases. This review aims to summarize what is currently known about the biological and especially proteomic relationships and similarities between these two age-related devastating diseases of modern day life. This study may also aid in future for the identification of a single or a panel of potential blood-based protein biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD and T2DM with high sensitivity and specificity.

AB  - Objective: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is thought to be a risk factor for endometrial hyperplasia, but potential links between the two diseases are unknown. This study aims to evaluate the role of T2DM in the progression of endometrial hyperplasia.
   Methods: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal (N) group, endometrial hyperplasia (NH) group, T2DM (T) group, and endometrial hyperplasia with T2DM (TH) group. Proteomics analysis was performed to determine the protein profile of endometrial tissues. Proliferation, migration, and invasion of cells with/without GLANT2-knockdown were assessed. Immunohistochemical staining and ELISA were used to examine the expression of GALNT2 in endometrial tissues and serum of clinical samples.
   Results: The highest uterus index and endometrial thickness were observed in TH group, with the expression of proliferation marker PCNA increased significantly, indicating that T2DM facilitates the progress of endometrial hyperplasia. Proteomics analysis showed that there were significant differences in protein profiles among groups and differential proteins were mainly enriched in metabolic pathways. Further verification by molecular biology analysis indicated that GALNT2 is the key target for T2DM facilitating endometrial hyperplasia. The expression of GALNT2 was significantly decreased in high glucose environment. T2DM could synergize the proliferative function of GALNT2 aberration by activating EGFR/AKT/ERK pathway. The decreased expressions of GALNT2 in clinical samples were associated with worse subtypes of endometrial hyperplasia.
   Conclusion: T2DM promoted the progression of endometrial hyperplasia by regulating the GALNT2-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR and enhancing cell proliferation. GALNT2 has the potential to be a novel biomarker in the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an independent risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, identifying periphery biomarkers correlated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is of importance for early diagnosis of AD. Here, we performed platelet proteomics in T2DM patients with MCI (T2DM-MCI) and without MCI (T2DM-nMCI). Pearson analysis of the omics data with MMSE (mini-mental state examination), A beta 1-42/A beta 1-40 (beta-amyloid), and rGSK-3 beta(T/S9) (total to Serine-9-phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta) revealed that mitophagy/autophagy-, insulin signaling-, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways-related proteins were most significantly involved. Among them, only the increase of optineurin, an autophagy-related protein, was simultaneously correlated with the reduced MMSE score, and the increased A beta 1-42/A beta 1-40 and rGSK-3 beta(T/S9), and the optineurin alone could discriminate T2DM-MCI from T2DM-nMCI. Combination of the elevated platelet optineurin and rGSK-3 beta(T/S9) enhanced the MCI-discriminating efficiency with AUC of 0.927, specificity of 86.7%, sensitivity of 85.3%, and accuracy of 0.859, which is promising for predicting cognitive decline in T2DM patients.

AB  - Currently, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity are major global public health issues, and their prevalence in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are among the highest in the world. In 2019, The UAE diabetes national prevalence was 15.4%. In recent years there has been a considerable investigation of predictive biomarkers associated with these conditions. This study analysed fasting (8 h) blood samples from an obese, normoglycemic cohort and an obese, T2DM cohort of UAE nationals, employing clinical chemistry analysis, 1D H-1 NMR and mass spectroscopy (FIA-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS) techniques. The novel findings reported for the first time in a UAE population revealed significant differences in a number of metabolites in the T2DM cohort. Metabolic fingerprints identified by NMR included BCAAs, trimethylamine N-oxide, beta -hydroxybutyrate, trimethyl uric acid, and alanine. A targeted MS approach showed significant differences in lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, acylcarnitine, amino acids and sphingomyelins; Lyso.PC.a.C18.0, PC.ae.C34.2, C3.DC..C4.OH, glutamine and SM.C16.1, being the most significant metabolites. Pearson's correlation studies showed associations between these metabolites and the clinical chemistry parameters across both cohorts. This report identified differences in metabolites in response to T2DM in agreement with many published population studies. This contributes to the global search for a bank of metabolite biomarkers that can predict the advent of T2DM and give insight to its pathogenic mechanisms.

AB  - The global incidence of metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) has assumed epidemic proportions, leading to adverse health and socio-economic impacts. It is therefore of critical importance the early diagnosis of DM2 patients and the detection of those at increased risk of disease. In this respect, Precision Medicine (PM) is an emerging approach that includes practices, tests, decisions and treatments adapted to the characteristics of each patient. With regard to DM2, PM manages a wealth of "omics" data (genomic, metabolic, proteomic, environmental, clinical and paraclinical) to increase the number of clinically validated biomarkers in order to identify patients in early stage even before the prediabetic phase.
   Significance: In this paper, we discuss the epidemic dimension of metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and the urgent demand for novel biomarkers to reduce the incidence or even delay the onset of DM2. Recent research data produced by "multi-omics" technologies (genomics/epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics), suggest that many potential biomarkers might be helpful in the prediction and early diagnosis of DM2. Predictive, Preventive and Personalized Medicine (PPPM) manages and integrates these data to apply personalized, preventive, and therapeutic approaches. This is significant because there is an emerging need for establishing channels for communication and personalized consultation between systems research and precision medicine, as the medicine of the future.

AB  - In recent years, metabolomics has become a necessary tool for understanding the impact of external and pathological factors on the operation of biological systems. The first reports of metabolomics date back to the 1970s, however, the area only began to develop dynamically at the beginning of this century and has proved effective only during the present decade. The five primary tools used in this form of analysis are NMR spectrometry, HPLC, TLC-UV, GC-MS and LC-MS/MS, with MS as the most universal approach, particularly when used together with chromatographic separation and NMR. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is a rapidly growing problem with global consequences. The metabolomic approach has been extensively applied to examining T2DM, insulin resistance and obesity, not only to assess the development of the disease, but also to discover its potential biomarkers. The presented review summarizes current studies on lipidomic and proteomic profiles in the context of different types of diabetes mellitus disease (T1DM, T2DM and GDM), as determined by chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an independent risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and thus identifying who among the increasing T2DM populations may develop into AD is important for early intervention. By using TMT-labeling coupled high-throughput mass spectrometry, we conducted a comprehensive plasma proteomic analysis in none-T2DM people (Ctrl, n = 30), and the age-/sex-matched T2DM patients with mild cognitive impairment (T2DM-MCI, n = 30) or T2DM without MCI (T2DM-nMCI, n = 25). The candidate biomarkers identified by proteomics and bioinformatics analyses were verified by ELISA, and their diagnostic capabilities were evaluated with machine learning. A total of 53 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in T2DM-MCI compared with T2DM-nMCI patients. These DEPs were significantly enriched in multiple biological processes, such as amyloid neuropathies, CNS disorders, and metabolic acidosis. Among the DEPs, alpha-1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1), major viral protein (PRNP), and valosin-containing protein (VCP) showed strong correlation with AD high-risk genes APP, MAPT, APOE, PSEN1, and PSEN2. Also, the levels of PP2A cancer inhibitor (CIP2A), PRNP, corticotropin-releasing factor-binding protein (CRHBP) were significantly increased, while the level of VCP was decreased in T2DM-MCI patients compared with that of the T2DM-nMCI, and these changes were correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Further machine learning data showed that increases in PRNP, CRHBP, VCP, and rGSK-3 beta(T/S9) (ratio of total to serine-9-phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta) had the greatest power to identify mild cognitive decline in T2DM patients.

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a peptidomic profile based on LC-MS/MS and random forest (RF) algorithm to distinguish the urinary peptidomic scenario of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with different stages of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Urine from 60 T2DM patients was collected: 22 normal (stage A1), 18 moderately increased (stage A2) and 20 severely increased (stage A3) albuminuria. A total of 1080 naturally occurring peptides were detected, which resulted in the identification of a total of 100 proteins, irrespective of the patients' renal status. The classification accuracy showed that the most severe DKD (A3) presented a distinct urinary peptidomic pattern. Estimates for peptide importance assessed during RF model training included multiple fragments of collagen and alpha-1 antitrypsin, previously associated to DKD. Proteasix tool predicted 48 proteases potentially involved in the generation of the 60 most important peptides identified in the urine of DM patients, including metallopeptidases, cathepsins, and calpains. Collectively, our study lightened some biomarkers possibly involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of DKD, suggesting that peptidomics is a valuable tool for identifying the molecular mechanisms underpinning the disease and thus novel therapeutic targets.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the current study is to accomplish a relative exploration of the biological roles of differentially dysregulated genes (DRGs) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study aimed to determine the impact of these DRGs on the biological pathways and networks that are related to the associated disorders and complications in T2DM and to predict its role as prospective biomarkers.
   Methods: Datasets obtained from metabolomic and proteomic profiling were used for investigation of the differential expression of the genes. A subset of DRGs was integrated into IPA software to explore its biological pathways, related diseases, and their regulation in T2DM. Upon entry into the IPA, only 94 of the DRGs were recognizable, mapped, and matched within the database.
   Results: The study identified networks that explore the dysregulation of several functions; cell components such as degranulation of cells; molecular transport process and metabolism of cellular proteins; and inflammatory responses. Top disorders associated with DRGs in T2DM are related to organ injuries such as renal damage, connective tissue disorders, and acute inflammatory disorders. Upstream regulator analysis predicted the role of several transcription factors of interest, such as STAT3 and HIF alpha, as well as many kinases such as JAK kinases, which affects the gene expression of the dataset in T2DM. Interleukin 6 (IL6) is the top regulator of the DRGs, followed by leptin (LEP). Monitoring the dysregulation of the coupled expression of the following biomarkers (TNF, IL6, LEP, AGT, APOE, F2, SPP1, and INS) highlights that they could be used as potential prognostic biomarkers.
   Conclusion: The integration of data obtained by advanced metabolomic and proteomic technologies has made it probable to advantage in understanding the role of these biomarkers in the identification of significant biological processes, pathways, and regulators that are associated with T2DM and its comorbidities.

AB  - Aim: The Xiaoke Pill containing Chinese herb extracts and Glibenclamide, is used in therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and is effective in reducing the risk of hypoglycemia and improving diabetes symptoms compared with Glibenclamide. We describe a quantitative proteomics project to measure the T2DM serum proteome response to the Xiaoke Pill and Glibenclamide.
   Methods: Based on a recently conducted 48-week clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Glibenclamide (n = 400) and Xiaoke Pill (n = 400), after matching for age, sex, BMI, drug dose and whether hypoglycemia occurred, 32 patients were selected for the serum based proteomic analysis and divided into four groups (with/without hypoglycemia treated with Xiaoke Pill or Glibenclamide, n = 8 for each group). We screened the differential serum proteins related to treatments and the onset of hypoglycemia using the iTRAQ labeling quantitative proteomics technique. Baseline and follow-up samples were used.
   Results: The quantitative proteomics experiments demonstrated that 25 and 21 proteins differed upon treatment with the Xiaoke Pill in patients without and with hypoglycemia, respectively, while 24 and 25 proteins differed upon treatment with Glibenclamide in patients without and with hypoglycemia, respectively. The overlap of different proteins between the patients with and without hypoglycemia given the same drug treatment was much greater than between the patients given different drug treatments.
   Conclusions: We conclude that the serum proteins response to the two different anti-diabetic drug treatments may serve as a sensitive biomarker for evaluation of the therapeutic effects and continue investigations into the mechanism.

AB  - AimType-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) affects millions globally, with escalating rates. It often leads to undiagnosed complications and commonly coexists with other health conditions. This study investigates two types of prevalent comorbidities related to T2DM-the circulatory system (DCM1) and digestive system diseases (DCM2)-using clinical, genomic and proteomic datasets. The aim is to identify new biomarkers by applying existing machine learning (ML) based techniques for early detection, prognosis and diagnosis of these comorbidities.MethodsHere, we report a cross-sectional retrospective analysis from a T2DM dataset of T2DM associated concordant comorbidities (diseases with shared pathophysiology and management) from the Diastrat cohort (a T2DM cohort) recruited at the Northern Ireland Centre for Stratified Medicine (NICSM), in Northern Ireland.ResultsIn the clinical data analysis, we identified that lipidemia was shown to negatively correlate with depression in the DCM1 group while positively correlate with depression in the DCM2 group. In genomic analysis, we identified statistically significant variants rs9844730 in procollagen-lysine (PLOD2), rs73590361 in beta-1,4-N-acetyl- galactosaminyl-transferase (B4GALNT3) and rs964680 in A kinase (PRKA) anchor protein 14 (AKAP14) which appear to differentiate DCM1 and DCM2 groups. In proteomic analysis, we identified 4 statistically significant proteins: natriuretic peptides B (BNP), pro-adrenomedullin (ADM), natriuretic peptides B (NT-proBNP) and discoidin (DCBLD2) that can differentiate DCM1 and DCM2 groups and have built robust ML model using clinical, genomic, and proteomic markers (0.83 receiver operative characteristics curve area, 84% positive predictive value and 83% negative predictive value and a classification accuracy of 83%) for prediction of DCM1 and DCM2 groups.ConclusionOur study successfully identifies novel clinical, genomic, and proteomic biomarkers that differentiate between circulatory and digestive system comorbidities in Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus patients. The machine learning model we developed demonstrates strong predictive capabilities, providing a promising tool for the early detection, prognosis, and diagnosis of these T2DM-associated comorbidities. These findings have the potential to enhance personalized management strategies for patients with T2DM, ultimately improving clinical outcomes. Further research is needed to validate these biomarkers and integrate them into clinical practice.

AB  - Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major microvascular complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Monitoring the early diagnostic period and disease progression plays a crucial role in treating DKD. In this study, to comprehensively elucidate the molecular characteristics of urinary proteins and urinary exosome proteins in type 2 DKD, we performed large-scale urinary proteomics (n=144) and urinary exosome proteomics (n=44) analyses on T2DM patients with albuminuria in varying degrees. The dynamics analysis of the urinary and exosome proteomes in our study provides a valuable resource for discovering potential urinary biomarkers in patients with DKD. A series of potential biomarkers, such as SERPINA1 and transferrin (TF), were detected and validated to be used for DKD diagnosis or disease monitoring. The results of our study comprehensively elucidated the changes in the urinary proteome and revealed several potential biomarkers reflecting the progression of DKD, which provide a reference for DKD biomarker screening.

AB  - Glycosylation is involved in several biological processes, and its alterations can reflect the process of certain diseases. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has attained the status of a global pandemic; however, the difference in salivary protein glycosylation between healthy subjects and patients with T2DM has not been fully understood. In the present study, salivary specimens from patients with T2DM (n = 72) and healthy volunteers (HVs, n = 80) were enrolled and divided into discovery and validation cohorts. A method combining the lectin microarray and lectin blotting was employed to investigate and confirm the altered glycopatterns in salivary glycoproteins. Then, lectin-mediated affinity capture of glycoproteins and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS were performed to obtain the precise structural information of the altered glycans. As a result, the glycopatterns recognized by 5 lectins (LEL, VVA, Jacalin, RCA120 and DSA) showed significant alteration in the saliva of T2DM patients. Notably, the glycopattern of Gal beta-1,4GlcNAc (LacNAc) recognized by LEL exhibited a significant increase in T2DM patients compared to HVs in both discovery and validation cohorts. The MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS results indicated that there were 10 and 7 LacNAc-containing N/O-glycans (e.g. m/z 1647.586, 11 688.613 and 1562.470) that were identified only in T2DM patients. Besides, the relative abundance of 3 LacNAc-containing N-glycans and 10 LacNAc-containing O-glycans showed an increase in the glycopattern in T2DM patients. These results indicated that the glycopattern of LacNAc is increased in salivary glycoproteins from T2DM patients, and an increase in LacNAc-containing N/O-glycans may contribute to this alteration. Our findings provide useful information to understand the complex physiological changes in the T2DM patients.

AB  - Aims of the Study. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has thousand years of history, and syndrome differentiation is the foundation and essence of the TCM theory. As it has distinctive advantages in diagnosing and treating the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the purpose of this research is to distinguish T2DM patients with or without damp-heat syndrome (DHS), as well as to discover biomarkers associated with syndrome employing the metabolomics-proteomics technique. Materials and Methods. The metabolomics-proteomics of sixty patients with T2DM were acquired by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In addition, some clinical features, containing total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) together with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), were determined via clinical detection strategies. Abundant metabolites and proteins, respectively, were identified with the analysis of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results. 22 differentially abundant metabolites and 15 differentially abundant proteins were determined. The analysis of bioinformatics suggested that the differentially abundant proteins were commonly associated with the renin-angiotensin system, vitamin digestion and absorption, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and so on. Furthermore, differentially abundant metabolites were amino acids and were associated with the biosynthesis of CoA and pantothenate, together with the metabolisms of phenylalanine, beta-alanine, proline, and arginine. Combination analysis revealed that the vitamin metabolism pathway was predominantly affected. Conclusions. DHS syndrome can be separated by certain metabolic-proteomic differences, and metabolism is particularly prominent, especially in vitamin digestion and absorption. From the molecular level, we provide preliminary data for the extensive application of TCM in the study of T2DM, and at the same time benefited in a sense diagnosis and treatment of T2DM.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial condition resulting in high fasting blood glucose levels. Although its diagnosis is straightforward, there is not one set of biomarkers or drug targets that can be used for classification or personalized treatment of individuals who suffer from this condition. Instead, the application of multiplex methods incorporating a systems biology approach is essential in order to increase our understanding of this disease. This chapter reviews the state of the art in biomarker studies of human type 2 diabetes from a proteomic and metabolomic perspective. Our main focus was on biomarkers for disease prediction as these could lead to early intervention strategies for the best possible patient outcomes.

AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a complication associated with diabetes, leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Despite significant progress in understanding DN, the cellular mechanisms leading to the renal damage are incompletely defined. in this study, with the aim to identify urine biomarkers for the early renal alterations in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), we performed urinary proteomic analysis of 10 normoalburninuric patients with T2D, 12 patients with type 2 DN (T2DN), and 12 healthy subjects. Proteins were separated by 2-DE and identified with ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS. Comparing the patients proteomic profiles with those of normal subjects, we identified 11 gradually differently changed proteins. The decreased proteins were the prostatic acid phosphatase precursor, the ribonuclease and the kallikrein-3. Eight proteins were progressively increased in both patients groups: transthyretin precursor, Ig K chain C region, Ig K chain V-II region Cum, Ig K-chain VIII region SIE, carbonic anhydrase 1, plasma retinol-binding protein, beta-2-microglobulin precursor, beta-2-glycoprotein 1. The proteomic analysis allowed us to identify several increased urinary proteins, not only in T2DN but also in T2D patients in which the microalburninuria was in the normal range. These patterns of urinary proteins might represent a potential tool for a better understanding of diabetic renal damage.

AB  - Background Early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is still difficult. Screening of plasma biomarkers has great significance of optimizing diagnosis and predicting the complications of T2DM. Methods We used a special diet, Purina #5008, to induce diabetes in Zucker leptin receptor gene-deficient rats (fa/fa) to establish Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, simulating the early stage of T2DM. The differentially expressed proteins (DEP) and lipids (DEL), as potential biomarkers, were screened to compare the plasma expression levels in ZDF rats and their basic diet-fed wild-type controls (fa/+) by Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results These two groups had different plasma proteins and lipids profiles consisting of 84 DEPs and, 179 DELs identified in the positive ion mode and 178 DELs in the negative ion mode, respectively. Enrichment analysis of these different indicators showed that oxidative stress, insulin resistance and metabolic disorders of glycan and lipid played an important role in generating the difference. Some markers can be used as candidate biomarkers in prediction and treatments of T2DM, such as ceruloplasmin, apolipoprotein C-I, apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein C-IV. Conclusion These plasma differences help to optimize the diagnosis and predict the complications of T2DM, although this remains to be verified in the crowd. Trace elements related-metalloproteins, such as ceruloplasmin, and lipid metabolism and transport-related apolipoprotein C are expected to be candidate biomarkers of T2DM and should be given more attention.

AB  - Regulation of blood glucose requires precise coordination between different endocrine systems and multiple organs. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) arises from a dysregulated response to elevated glucose levels in the circulation. Globally, the prevalence of T2D has increased dramatically in all age groups. T2D in older adults is associated with higher mortality and reduced functional status, leading to higher rate of institutionalization. Despite the potential healthcare challenges associated with the presence of T2D in the elderly, the pathogenesis and phenotype of late-onset T2D is not well studied. Here we applied untargeted metabolite profiling of urine samples from people with and without late-onset T2D using ultra-performance liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to identify urinary biomarkers for late-onset T2D in the elderly. Statistical modeling of measurements and thorough validation of structural assignment using liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) have led to the identification of metabolite biomarkers associated with late-onset T2D. Lower levels of phenylalanine, acetylhistidine, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were found in urine samples of T2D subjects validated with commercial standards. Elevated levels of 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), which previously has only been implicated in animal model of diabetes, was found in urine of older people with T2D.

AB  - Background: In 2016, the UK had 4.5 million people with diabetes, predominantly Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The NHS allocates 10 pound billion (9% of its budget) to manage diabetes. Metformin is the primary treatment for T2DM, but 35% of patients don't benefit from it, leading to complications. This study aims to delve into metformin's efficacy using clinical, genomic, and proteomic data to uncover new biomarkers and build a Machine Learning predictor for early metformin response detection. Methods: Here we report analysis from a T2DM dataset of individuals prescribed metformin monotherapy from the Diastrat cohort recruited at the Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Northern Ireland. Results: In the clinical data analysis, comparing responders (those achieving HbA1c <= 48 mmol/mol) to non-responders (with HbA1c > 48 mmol/mol), we identified that creatinine levels and bodyweight were more negatively correlated with response than non-response. In genomic analysis, we identified statistically significant (p-value <0.05) variants rs6551649 (LPHN3), rs6551654 (LPHN3), rs4495065 (LPHN3) and rs7940817 (TRPC6) which appear to differentiate the responders and non-responders. In proteomic analysis, we identified 15 statistically significant (p-value <0.05, q-value <0.05) proteomic markers that differentiate controls, responders, non-responders and treatment groups, out of which the most significant were HAOX1, CCL17 and PAI that had fold change similar to 2. A machine learning model was build; the best model predicted non-responders with 83% classification accuracy. Conclusion: Further testing in prospective validation cohorts is required to determine the clinical utility of the proposed model.

AB  - Aims: In this study, we applied quantitative proteomic analysis to identify urinary proteins associated with diabetic nephropathy (DN).
   Methods: Two-dimensional image-converted analysis of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry detected the proteins differentially excreted between normoalbuminuric and macroalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n = 6 each). Urinary levels of excreted proteins were measured by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis using an independent sample set (n = 77). Urinary afamin levels were measured by ELISA in T2DM and DN patients enrolled in this cohort study (n = 203).
   Results: One-hundred-four proteins displayed significant alterations in excretion. Nine of these candidates were validated by MRM analysis. Among them, the levels of afamin, CD44 antigen, and lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2, which have not previously been implicated in DN, were significantly associated with both the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) and eGFR. We further measured afamin levels in urine collected from T2DM patients who did not yet have significant kidney disease (ACR < 300 mg/g or eGFR change rate <= 3.3%/year). The urinary afamin to creatinine ratio (Afa/Cre) was significantly higher in patients who progressed to a more severe DN stage or had early renal decline than in patients who did not.
   Conclusions: Afa/Cre was significantly increased in T2DM patients who subsequently developed DN. Afa/Cre may be useful to predict patients with T2DM at high risk of nephropathy before the development of macroalbuminuria or reduced kidney function, although further validation studies in a larger population are needed.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose due to insulin deficiency or resistance. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease leading to irreversible loss of neurons, intellectual abilities, memory and reasoning. The worldwide prevalence of diabetes and AD in elderly population is a major public health concern. Interestingly, both health issues are unraveling the puzzling links. The clinico-pathological relationship between diabetes and AD has been reported at genomic and proteomic levels. The association of virus infection in type 2 diabetes mellitus and AD has been reported in few recent studies, some have shown direct evidence of virus infection in diabetes and AD while other have shown that diabetes increases the risk of developing AD. This review aims to summarize the association of few common viruses like Hepatitis C Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus-1 which affects both these two age-related devastating diseases. We also discuss the pathological links of Influenza virus, Cytomegalovirus, West Nile virus, Enterovirus, Herpes Simplex Virus-2, Hepatitis viruses in diabetes and Influenza virus, Picornavirus and Borna disease virus in AD. Establishing such relationships and defining their common pathogenesis and patho-physiological mechanisms may lead to new concepts and paths for developing novel preventive strategies and pharmacological treatment options for diabetes and AD. This study may aid in future for the identification of a single or a panel of likely blood-based viral biomarkers for early diagnosis of diabetes and AD with high sensitivity and specificity.

AB  - Effect of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) mixtures on development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the underlying mechanism, especially at protein levels, are largely unknown. We exposed a mixture of five OCPs to zebrafish at concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.25, 2.5, and 25 mu g/L for 12 weeks. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were quantitatively identified in female zebrafish livers, and its functional study was conducted. The significantly high glucose and low insulin levels were observed only at 0.05 mu g/L, linking to the different pattern of DEPs than other concentrations. A total of 1082 proteins was quantified, of which 321 proteins formed 6 clusters in protein dynamics analysis. The enriched pathways in cluster 3 showing distinct pattern of DEPs could explain the nonlinear response at 0.05 mu g/L, indicating that OCP mixtures adversely affected proteins associated with mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. We proposed a feasible mechanism that decrease in expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase led to abnormal accumulation of aldehydes, reducing expression of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and resulting in disruption of glucose homeostasis. Our findings help to better understand the causality of T2DM by exposure to OCP mixtures and to identify biomarkers in the protein expression level.

AB  - Background: Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are characterized by underlying low-grade chronic inflammation. Metformin has been used as the first line of therapy in T2DM as it decreases hepatic glucose production and glucose intestinal absorption, enhances insulin sensitivity and weight loss, and is known to ameliorate inflammation. The mechanisms through which metformin exerts its effect remain unclear. Proteomics has emerged as a unique approach to explore the biological changes associated with diseases, including T2DM. It provides insight into the circulating biomarkers/mediators which could be utilized for disease screening, diagnosis, and prognosis. Methods: This study evaluated the proteomic changes in obese (Ob), obese diabetics (OD), and obese diabetic patients on metformin (ODM) using a 2D DIGE MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric approach. Results: Significant changes in sixteen plasma proteins (15 up and 1 down, ANOVA, p <= 0.05; fold change >= 1.5) were observed in the ODM group when compared to the Ob and OD groups. Bioinformatic network pathway analysis revealed that the majority of these altered plasma proteins are involved in distinct pathways involving acute-phase response, inflammation, and oxidative response and were centered around HNF4A, ERK, JNK, and insulin signaling pathways. Conclusions: Our study provides important information about the possible biomarkers altered by metformin treatment in obese patients with and without T2DM. These altered plasma proteins are involved in distinct pathways involving acute-phase response, inflammation, and oxidative response and were centered around HNF4A, ERK, JNK, and insulin signaling pathways. The presented proteomic profiling approach may help in identifying potential biomarkers/mediators affected by metformin treatment in T2DM and inform the understanding of metformin's mechanisms of action.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), complicated by type 2 diabetes, is associated with a high incidence of ocular surface disease, and no effective drug treatment exists. Diabetes mellitus (DM) MGD shows a notable disturbance in lipid metabolism. Er-Dong-Xiao-Ke decoction (EDXKD) has important functions in nourishing yin, clearing heat, and removing blood stasis, which are effective in the treatment of DM MGD. Aim of the study: To observe the therapeutic effect of EDXKD on DM MGD and its underlying molecular mechanism. Materials and methods: After establishing a type 2 DM (T2DM)-induced MGD rat model, different doses of EDXKD and T0070907 were administered. The chemical constituents of EDXKD were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the molecular mechanism of EDXKD in treating DM MGD was predicted using network pharmacology. Lipid metabolism in DM meibomian glands (MGs) was analyzed using LC-MS/MS, and lipid biomarkers were screened and identified. Histological changes and lipid accumulation in MGs were detected by staining, and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) expression in MG acinar cells was detected by immunofluorescence. The expression of lipid metabolism-related factors was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) or western blotting. Results: EDXKD reduced lipid accumulation in the MGs and improved the ocular surface index in DM MGD rats. The main active components of EDXKD had advantages in lipid regulation. Additionally, the PPARG signaling pathway was the key pathway of EDXKD in the treatment of DM MGD. Twelve lipid metabolites were biomarkers of EDXKD in the treatment of DM MGD, and glycerophospholipid metabolism was the main pathway of lipid regulation. Moreover, EDXKD improved lipid deposition in the acini and upregulated the expression of PPARG. Further, EDXKD regulated the PPARG-mediated UCP2/AMPK signaling network, inhibited lipid production, and promoted lipid transport. Conclusion: EDXKD is an effective treatment for MGD in patients with T2DM. EDXKD can regulate lipids by regulating the PPARG-mediated UCP2/AMPK signaling network, as it reduced lipid accumulation in the MGs of DM MGD rats, promoted lipid metabolism, and improved MG function and ocular surface indices.

AB  - Purpose Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterized by chronic hyperglycemia. So far, the pathogenesis of diabetes has not been fully elucidated. Identifying new potential molecule mechanisms and biomarkers in this process could contribute to the understanding of pathophysiology. Experimental design Proteomic changes in the liver of type 2 diabetic mice (n = 6) and normal mice (n = 6) are studied. Triplicate experiments are carried out for each sample. Results A total of 15 differentially expressed proteins (DEPS) are identified and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis indicates that DEPS mainly involved two inflammatory pathways: glutathione metabolic pathway and the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway. The core of protein-protein interaction is the tumor necrosis factor inflammatory pathway, indicating the connection between inflammation and diabetes. Ten out of fifteen gene transcript levels are consistent with proteomics by quantitative RT-PCR validation. The transcriptional levels of OAT (ornithine aminotransferase) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase1 (FBP1) were significantly increased, whereas fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) and ef-2 transcription levels decreased significantly. In addition, western blotting results showed that the expression of OAT and FBP protein increased significantly in the diabetes group, while elongation factor 2 decreased significantly and FABP do not have significant difference in the diabetes group. Conclusions and clinical relevance Taken together, the present exploratory liver proteomic analysis might be seen as an important starting point for studies targeting specific liver proteins aimed at the implementation of new biomarkers for the early detection of type 2 diabetes mellitus-related potential mechanisms, hoping to provide biomarkers and clinical therapeutic targets of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - The pseudotargeted metabolomics method integrates advantages of nontargeted and targeted analysis because it can acquire data of metabolites in the multireaction monitoring (MRM) mode of mass spectrometry (MS) without needing standards. The key is the ion-pair information collection from samples to be analyzed. It is well-known that sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical Fragment ion (SWATH) MS mode can acquire MS2 information to a maximum extent. To expediently acquire as many ion-pairs as possible with optimal collision energy (CE), an ion-pair selection approach based on SWATH MS acquisition with variable isolation windows was developed in this study. Initially, nontargeted acquisition of all metabolites information in plasma Standard Reference Material (SRM 1950) was performed by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) MS platform with three CEs. With the help of software tool, the ion-pairs of unique metabolites were gained. Then they were validated in scheduled MRM coupled with UHPLC. After removing false positive, the ion-pairs with an optimal CE was integrated. A total of 1373 unique metabolite ion-pairs were obtained at positive ion mode. And repeatability of the established pseudotargeted approach was evaluated by intraday and interday precision. The results demonstrated the method was stable, reliable, and suitable for metabolomics study. As an application example, alterations of serum metabolites in Type 2 diabetes were investigated by using the established method. This work provides a pseudotargeted ion-pair selection method based on SWATH MS acquisition with the characters of increased metabolite coverage, suitable CE, and convenient processing.

AB  - PURPOSE. An early neurodegenerative component of diabetic retinal disease (DRD) that precedes the vascular findings of clinically diagnosed diabetic retinopathy (DR) is increasingly being recognized. However, the relevant molecular mechanisms and biomarkers for early DRD are poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to uncover novel potential mediators of early diabetic retinal neuronal dysfunction through analysis of the aqueous fluid proteome in preclinical DR. METHODS. Aqueous fluid was collected from subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) but no clinical DR and from nondiabetic controls undergoing routine cataract surgery. Preoperative spectral-domain optical coherence tomography of the macula was obtained. Tandem mass tag LC-MS/MS was performed to identify proteins differentially present in diabetic and control aqueous fluid, and proteins with >50% change and P < 0.05 were considered significant. Selected results were validated with western blot of human aqueous fluid samples. RESULTS. We identified decreased levels of proteins implicated in neuronal synapse formation and increased levels of inflammatory proteins in the aqueous fluid from patients with type 2 DM but no DR compared with controls. Of the differentially present synaptic proteins that we identified and confirmed with western blot, the majority have not previously been linked with DRD. CONCLUSIONS. The proteomic profile of aqueous fluid from individuals with type 2 DM but no DR suggests that retinal neuronal dysfunction and inflammation represent very early events in the pathophysiology of DRD. These findings support the concept that diabetic retinal neurodegeneration precedes vascular pathology and reveal novel potential mediators and/or biomarkers warranting further investigation.

AB  - Lactoferrin (LF) is a protein that plays important roles in many diseases including diabetes mellitus (DM). DM is one of the most challenging health concerns of the 21st century. At least 30% of the diabetic population is undiagnosed at any one time, so effective and early diagnosis is of critical concern. Several of the body's chemicals, such as enzymes, electrolytes, and proteins, have been used as biomarkers in the diagnosis of diabetic diseases. Detection of LF is considered an important sign of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), due to its activity as an anti-inflammatory agent and in the down-regulation of pro-inflammation. LF is produced by glandular epithelial cells and neutrophils, and a decrease in its concentration is linked with the dysfunction of neutrophils in many diseases. Neutrophils are the first line of defence against pathogens that invade the human body during inflammation. Therefore, the health of neutrophils can be employed as a biomarker in the diagnosis of diseases such as diabetes. A decrease in LF concentrations in T2DM could result in increased levels of inflammatory markers that are associated with the inflammation activity. Increased understanding of the link between LF concentration and development of T2DM should improve early diagnosis and treatment outcomes.
   LF is identified through use of various techniques such as immunoassay, proteomics, and spectrometry. The aim of this review is to summarise each pathway and some of the most relevant LF biomarkers that may be used to monitor the development or progression of diabetes and its complications, and the link between levels of LF and neutrophil dysfunction in T2DM. Moreover, the objective of this review is to show the most common LF analysis that may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of T2DM and discuss to what extent this analysis method can be a tool for prognostic and diagnostic work.

AB  - Purpose To investigate the association between urinary complement proteins and renal outcome in biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy (DN). Methods Untargeted proteomic and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional analyses and targeted proteomic analysis using parallel reaction-monitoring (PRM)-mass spectrometry was performed to determine the abundance of urinary complement proteins in healthy controls, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, and patients with T2DM and biopsy-proven DN. The abundance of each urinary complement protein was individually included in Cox proportional hazards models for predicting progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Results Untargeted proteomic and functional analysis using the KEGG showed that differentially expressed urinary proteins were primarily associated with the complement and coagulation cascades. Subsequent urinary complement proteins quantification using PRM showed that urinary abundances of C3, C9, and complement factor H (CFAH) correlated negatively with annual estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline, while urinary abundances of C5, decay-accelerating factor (DAF), and CD59 correlated positively with annual rate of eGFR decline. Furthermore, higher urinary abundance of CFAH and lower urinary abundance of DAF were independently associated with greater risk of progression to ESRD. Urinary abundance of CFAH and DAF had a larger area under the curve (AUC) than that of eGFR, proteinuria, or any pathological parameter. Moreover, the model that included CFAH or DAF had a larger AUC than that with only clinical or pathological parameters. Conclusion Urinary abundance of complement proteins was significantly associated with ESRD in patients with T2DM and biopsy-proven DN, indicating that therapeutically targeting the complement pathway may alleviate progression of DN.

AB  - An early intervention using biomarkers to predict acute myocardial infarction (AMI) will effectively reduce global heart attack incidence, particularly among high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study attempted to identify potential biomarkers by detecting changes in the levels of plasma proteins in T2DM patients following onset of AMI in comparison with those without AMI. Volunteer T2DM patients without AMI (control; n=10) and T2DM patients with AMI (n=10) were recruited. Plasma samples from these patients were evaluated via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) to screen for proteins with level changes between the two groups. The abundance of spots on gel images was analyzed using Progenesis SameSpots and subjected to false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. Protein spots with statistically significant changes of at least 1.5 fold were selected for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Due to strong cardiac connections, tetranectin and titin were evaluated by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The adjusted P-values and fold changes between the two groups resulted in identification of 34 protein spots with significantly altered abundance. Upon MS analysis, 17 plasma proteins were identified: tetranectin, titin, clusterin, haptoglobin, myosin-13, zinc fnger protein 445, DNA repair protein RAD50, serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-IV, caspase-6, aminoacyl tRNA synthase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1, serotransferrin, retinol-binding protein 4, transthyretin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein A-I and serum amyloid A. Comparable patterns of changes in tetranectin and titin between the control and AMI groups were confirmed using ELISA. In summary, tetranectin and titin in plasma appeared to be closely associated with the onset of AMI among T2DM patients and can be used as potential biomarkers for prediction of a cardiac event, though this requires validation in a prospective cohort study.

AB  - Renal disease is prevalent in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. Aggressive metabolic control and lowering of systemic and/or intraglomerular blood pressure are effective interventions but not without side effects. Thus a better, early identification of patients at risk for incidence or progression to end-stage renal failure by the use of new, validated biomarkers is highly desirable. In the majority of patients, hypertension and hyperglycaemia are pathogenetically important pathways for the progression of renal disease. Nonetheless even aggressive therapy targeting these factors does not eliminate the risk of end-stage renal failure and experimental evidence suggests that many other pathways (e.g. tubulointerstitial hypoxia or inflammation etc.) also contribute. As their individual importance might vary from patient to patient, interventions which interfere are likely not to be therapeutically effective in all subjects. In this situation, an option to preserve the statistical power of clinical trials is to rely on biomarkers that reflect individual pathophysiology. In current clinical practice, albuminuria is the biomarker that has been best evaluated to guide stratified/personalized therapy but there is a clear need to expand our diagnostic abilities.

AB  - RationaleProteomics and metabolomics are widely used in the study of diabetes, but rarely in prediabetes research. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms of early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by analyzing proteomic changes at different stages of glucose metabolism. MethodsA total of 40 individuals undergoing routine physical health examinations between December 2016 and April 2017 were enrolled. Subjects were divided into four groups based on fasting blood glucose (FPG) levels: FPG < 5.6 mmol/L (group A); FPG >= 5.6 mmol/L and <6.1 mmol/L (group B); FPG >= 6.1 mmol/L and <7.0 mmol/L (group C); and FPG >= 7.0 mmol/L (group D). Each group had 10 cases. Sera from these 40 subjects were analyzed by label-free quantitative liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). LC/MS/MS with selected reaction monitoring mode was also performed for qualitative and quantitative metabolomics analysis. Differentially expressed proteins were identified. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to analyze the differentially expressed metabolites. ResultsA total of 202 differentially expressed proteins were screened and were identified as mainly secreted proteins. Comparing group A with group B, 32 proteins were up-regulated and 18 proteins were down-regulated. Comparing group A with group C, 24 proteins were up-regulated and 24 proteins were down-regulated. Comparing group A with group D, 19 proteins were up-regulated and 17 proteins were down-regulated. The fold change for up-regulated proteins was >1.2, p < 0.05, while the fold change for down-regulated proteins was <-1.2, p < 0.05. PLS-DA and OPLS-DA revealed 113 differentially expressed metabolites. Correlation analysis of differentially expressed metabolites of group A versus group B revealed that among the down-regulated differential proteins, transforming growth factor beta-induced protein ig-h3 correlated negatively with metabolite L-saccharin, while among the up-regulated differential proteins, apolipoprotein C-IV correlated negatively with metabolite 3-methyloxindole. Among all differentially expressed proteins, 19 proteins were associated with early initiation of chronic inflammation, including CD14 and CSF-1R, which were newly identified in the early onset of T2DM. ConclusionsMany proteins are differentially expressed between prediabetes and after T2DM diagnosis, although the specific mechanism remains unclear. The expression level of CD14 was significantly up-regulated and that of CSF-1R was significantly down-regulated when FPG was >= 5.6 mmol/L, suggesting that CD14 and CSF-1R may be important markers for early-onset T2DM and may serve as new targets for T2DM treatment.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a chronic multisystem disease with a high global prevalence. The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist liraglutide is known to lower glucose levels and reduce weight. However, the mechanisms underlying the benefits of liraglutide treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remain unclear. Twelve male patients with T2DM (pre and post liraglutide treatment) and HbA1c between 8% and 11% were recruited. In the present study, a two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI TOF) mass spectrometric approach combined with bioinformatics and network pathway analysis was used to explore the urine proteomic profile. The mean age of the patients was 52.4 +/- 7.5 years. After treatment with liraglutide, a statistically significant change (p < 0.006) was observed in HbA1c with no significant changes in body weight or markers of dyslipidemia. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis identified significant changes (>= 1.5-fold change, ANOVA, p <= 0.05) in 32 proteins (4 down- and 28 upregulated) in liraglutide post treatment compared to the pre-treatment state. Albumin, serotransferrin, metallothionein-2 (MT-2), and keratins K1 and K10 were found to be upregulated after liraglutide treatment. The patients showed significant improvement in glycemic control after the 12-week treatment with liraglutide. The renoprotective effect of liraglutide may be linked to the increased urinary abundance of MT-2 and the decreased abundance of zinc alpha 2-glycoprotein (ZAG) and Alpha-1 antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT). More studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind the renoprotective effects of liraglutide.

AB  - AIM: To establish and compare serum proteomic of diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients in various phases and discuss pathogenesis of DR so as to find out possible serum specific molecular markers for early diagnosis of DR.
   METHODS: Thirty-two subjects were divided into four groups: one group of eight type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients without apparent DR (No-DR, NDR), one group of eight T2DM patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), one group of eight T2DM patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy(PDR) and one group of eight healthy volunteer participants. Two dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) was applied to establish differential protein expression profiles in four groups. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS) was applied to identify mass spectrometry of differential proteins and analyze follow-up bioinformatics.
   RESULTS: 2D-DIGE maps of serum protein were satisfactory obtained from NDR, NPDR, PDR and normal control groups. Twenty-six different proteins spots were screened(the volume ratio was > 1.5 based on DeCyder software analysis). Twenty-four of them were verified and two of them were not. Fifteen proteins were verified. Most of them were high-abundant proteins in serum. The four relatively low-abundant ones were beta 2-glycoprotein I (beta (2)-GPI), alpha2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG), alpha1-acid glycoprotein (alpha(1)-AGP) and apolipoprotein A-1 (apo A-1). beta (2)-GPI expression was gradually increased in the development of DR but unrelated to the severity of DR. The volume ratio of beta (2)-GPI is 1.54, 2.43, and 2.84 in NDR, NPDR and PDR group respectively compared with normal control group.
   CONCLUSION: Serum proteomic analysis of 2D-DIGE combined with MALDI-TOF-TOF MS is feasible to be applied in the study of DR. 13 2-GPI probably takes part in the process of DR occurrence and development and it could be a candidate biomarker on DR diagnosis in early phase.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common diseases of endocrine and metabolic disorders, whose mechanism is still largely unknown. Fortunately, various "omics" tools have been employed to better understand the progression pathologies of T2DM and its complications. More specifically, proteomics, metabolomics and metagenomics have played crucial roles in advancing deeper understanding of the physiological processes and regulatory mechanisms of T2DM, such as regulation of signaling pathways perturbed by glucose levels, intestinal microorganism, and inflammation and so on. By analyzing the dynamic change and modification of proteins, proteomics has become an important tool in biology and medicine. Metabolomic analysis can amplify and quantify metabolites in living organisms to reveal the relative relationship between metabolites and physiological and pathological changes. There are also increasing evidences that the human microbiome, specifically the gastrointestinal microbiome have a potential role in the etiology and pathological outcomes of T2DM and its complications. This article summarized and discussed the recent applications of these "omics" tools in finding biomarkers for T2DM and its complications. We also reviewed employing multiple "omics" to further advance our understanding of this pathology. This review will benefit deeper understanding in new therapeutic and/or diagnostic biological target for the discovery of T2DM and its complications.

AB  - Aim/hypothesis: The aim of our study was to characterize the human salivary proteome and determine the changes in protein expression in two different stages of diabetic retinopathy with type-2 diabetes mellitus: (1) with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and (2) with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Type-2 diabetes mellitus without diabetic retinopathy (XDR) was designated as control.
   Method: In this study, 45 saliva samples were collected (15 samples from XDR control group, 15 samples from NPDR disease group and 15 samples from PDR disease group). Salivary proteins were extracted, reduced, alkylated, trypsin digested and labeled with an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) before being analyzed by an Orbitrap fusion tribrid mass spectrometer. Protein annotation, fold change calculation and statistical analysis were interrogated by Proteome Discoverer. Biological pathway analysis was performed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD003723-PX003725.
   Results: A total of 315 proteins were identified from the salivary proteome and 119 proteins were found to be differentially expressed. The differentially expressed proteins from the NPDR disease group and the PDR disease group were assigned to respective canonical pathways indicating increased Liver X receptor/Retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) activation, Farnesoid X receptor/Retinoid X receptor (FXR/RXR) activation, acute phase response signaling, sucrose degradation V and regulation of actin-based motility by Rho in the PDR disease group compared to the NPDR disease group.
   Conclusions/Interpretation: Progression from non-proliferative to proliferative retinopathy in type-2 diabetic patients is a complex multi-mechanism and systemic process. Furthermore, saliva was shown to be a feasible alternative sample source for diabetic retinopathy biomarkers.

AB  - The escalating prevalence of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) underscores the urgent need for improved early detection techniques and effective treatment strategies. In this context, our study presents a proteomic analysis of post-exercise skeletal muscle biopsies from individuals across a spectrum of glucose metabolism states: normal, prediabetes, and T2D. This enabled the identification of significant protein relationships indicative of each specific glycemic condition. Our investigation primarily leveraged the machine learning approach, employing the white-box algorithm relative evolutionary hierarchical analysis (REHA), to explore the impact of regulated, mixed mode exercise on skeletal muscle proteome in subjects with diverse glycemic status. This method aimed to advance the diagnosis of IR and T2D and elucidate the molecular pathways involved in its development and the response to exercise. Additionally, we used proteomics-specific statistical analysis to provide a comparative perspective, highlighting the nuanced differences identified by REHA. Validation of the REHA model with a comparable external dataset further demonstrated its efficacy in distinguishing between diverse proteomic profiles. Key metrics such as accuracy and the area under the ROC curve confirmed REHA's capability to uncover novel molecular pathways and significant protein interactions, offering fresh insights into the effects of exercise on IR and T2D pathophysiology of skeletal muscle. The visualizations not only underscored significant proteins and their interactions but also showcased decision trees that effectively differentiate between various glycemic states, thereby enhancing our understanding of the biomolecular landscape of T2D.

AB  - Purpose Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus. Microalbuminuria has been established as a risk factor for the development of diabetic renal disease. Recently, microalbuminuria has been reported to have limitations in determining disease risk and predicting DN Therefore, identification of more specific biomarkers for prediction of DN is needed.
   Experimental design. When kidney damage is initiated, glycoprotein leakage into the blood may occur, thus altering the glycoproteome profile of the blood. Here, we have used a combined approach of glycoprotein enrichment of plasma with a proteomic analysis to discover potential DN biomarkers. We isolated glycoproteins from plasma provided by six type 2 diabetes control (DC) and six type 2 DN patients using multi-lectin affinity chromatography. Captured glycoproteins were resolved by 1-D PAGE and tryptic digests of isolated proteins were analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
   Results: From the comparative and semi-quantitative proteome analysis, we identified 13 up- and 14 down-regulated glycoproteins in DN plasma. Among the up-regulated glycoproteins, the levels of lumican, vasorin and retinol binding protein-4 were verified by Western blot analysis of individual plasma samples.
   Conclusion and clinical relevance. Collectively, our findings show that biomarker discovery has considerable potential for predicting diabetic nephropathy in diabetic patients.

AB  - In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression may occur without detectable changes in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate. A new urinary peptide classifier (CKD273) has exhibited greater ability to detect CKD progression, however, its cost-effectiveness remains unknown. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of screening for CKD progression with the CKD273 classifier, as compared to UAE, in diabetic patients.
   A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to estimate costs and health outcomes [including overall survival and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] from a health system perspective for adopting a new annual screening strategy based on the CKD273 classifier as compared to annual UAE-based screening in a hypothetical cohort of T2DM patients. High-risk patients were defined as T2DM patients with at least one concomitant risk factor (i.e. patients with background genetic risk for developing the disease, obesity, hypertension and/or smoking history) for developing diabetic nephropathy secondary to cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related complications. Low-risk T2DM patients, were defined as those not having any of the aforementioned concomitant risk factors.
   Over the projected course of a patient's lifetime, in all T2DM patients annual screening with the CKD273 classifier was more costly, but also more effective, than annual screening with UAE. The incremental costs incurred with screening based on the CKD273 classifier were a,notsign3,053 per patient, while patients gained 0.13 QALYs. Hence, in all patients, annual screening with the CKD273 classifier was cost effective [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) a,notsign23,903/QALY gained], notably below current government thresholds for funding such health care interventions. For patients at high risk of developing diabetic nephropathy secondary to CVD-related complications, screening based on the CKD273 classifier was cost-saving (i.e. dominant, being both more effective and less expensive than UAE-based screening). Finally, in low-risk patients, CKD273 classifier-based screening was not cost effective (ICER a,notsign73,140/QALY) given current government willingness-to-pay thresholds.
   In diabetic patients, annual CKD273 classifier-based screening is more costly but also more effective in QALYs gained as compared to UAE. From a health provider perspective, the observed benefits are greatest when such screening is implemented in patients at high risk for diabetes-associated renal or cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).

AB  - Recent advances in genomics, metabolomics and proteomics have made it possible to interrogate disease pathophysiology and drug response on a systems level. The analysis and interpretation of the complex data obtained using these techniques is potentially fertile but equally challenging. We conducted a small clinical trial to explore the application of metabolomics data in candidate biomarker discovery. Specifically, serum and urine samples from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were profiled on metabolomics platforms before and after 8 weeks of treatment with one of three commonly used oral antidiabetic agents, the sulfonyurea glyburide, the biguanide metformin, or the thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone. Multivariate classification techniques were used to detect serum or urine analytes, obtained at baseline (pre-treatment) that could predict a significant treatment response after 8 weeks. Using this approach, we identified three analytes, measured at baseline, that were associated with response to a thiazolidinedione after 8 weeks of treatment. Although larger and longer-term studies are required to validate any of the candidate biomarkers, pharmacometabolomic profiling, in combination with multivariate classification, is worthy of further exploration as an adjunct to clinical decision making regarding treatment selection and for patient stratification within clinical trials.

AB  - Background: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed via the nonenzymatic glycation of sugars with amino acids. Two AGEs, Ne-(1-carboxymethyl)-L-Lysine (CML) and pentosidine, have been observed to be elevated in subjects suffering from a multitude of chronic disease states, and accumulation of these compounds may be related to the pathophysiology of disease progression and aging.
   Methods: We describe here the development and validation of a specific and reproducible LC-MS/MS method to quantify CML and pentosidine in human serum with lower limits of quantitation of 75 ng/mL and 5 ng/mL, respectively. The analyte calibration curve exhibited excellent linearity at a range of 0-10 900 ng/mL for CML and 0800 ng/mL for pentosidine. High-low linearity of 5 serum pairs was assessed, with a mean recovery of 103% (range 94-116%) for CML, and 104% (range 97-116%) for pentosidine.
   Results: Serum concentrations of CML and pentosidine were quantified in 30 control and 30 subjects with chronic renal insufficiency. A significant increase in both analytes was observed in renal failure compared to control subjects (2.1-fold and 8.4-fold, respectively; P<0.001 for both). In a separate cohort of 49 control versus 95 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), serum CML but not serum pentosidine, was significantly elevated in the T2DM patients, and CML was also correlated with glycemic control, as assessed by hemoglobin A1c (r = 0.34, P<0.001).
   Conclusions: These mass spectroscopy-based assays for serum CML and pentosidine should be useful in accurately evaluating circulating levels of these key AGEs in various disease states.

AB  - Hyperglycemia is widely recognized to be a potent stimulator of monocyte activity, which is a crucial event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We analyzed the monocyte proteome for potential markers that would enhance the ability to screen for early inflammatory status in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), using proteomic technologies. Monocytic cells (THP-1) were primed with high glucose (HG), their protein profiles were analyzed using 2DE and the downregulated differentially expressed spots were identified using MALDI TOF/MS. We selected five proteins that were secretory in function with the help of bioinformatic programs. A predominantly downregulated protein identified as cyclophilin A (sequence coverage 98%) was further validated by immunoblotting experiments. The cellular mRNA levels of cyclophilin A in various HG-primed cells were studied using qRT-PCR assays and it was observed to decrease in a dose-dependent manner. LC-ESI-MS was used to identify this protein in the conditioned media of HG-primed cells and confirmed by Western blotting as well as ELISA. Cyclophilin A was also detected in the plasma of patients with diabetes. We conclude that cyclophilin A is secreted by monocytes in response to HG. Given the paracrine and autocrine actions of cyclophilin A, the secreted immunophilin could be significant for progression of atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes. Our study also provides evidence that analysis of monocyte secretome is a viable strategy for identifying candidate plasma markers in diabetes.

AB  - Background. Measurement of urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) has recently become more popular as a means of assessing oxidative stress in the human body. The aim of this study is to compare the levels of urine 8-OHdG in patients with type 2 diabetes with and without nephropathy and to evaluate its role as a biochemical marker for distinguishing these patients from healthy and patients without complications. Methods. For this purpose, 52 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (32 with nephropathy (DMN), 20 without nephropathy (DM)) and 20 healthy control subjects (C) were included in this study. The urine concentrations of 8-OHdG were measured by modified LC-MS/MS method and compared with the first morning voiding urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) and HbA1c values of the same patients. Results. The concentrations of urine 8-OHdG in DMN and DM patients were higher than those of the control subjects (3.47 +/- 0.94, 2.92 +/- 1.73, 2.1 +/- 0.93 nmol/mol creatinine, respectively). But there was no statistical difference between DMN and DM (p = 0.115). There is significant correlation between urinary 8-OHdG and UACR (r = 0.501, p <= 0.001). According to ROC analysis, the AUC value of HbA1c was higher than the value of the AUC of 8-OHdG (0.882 and 0.771, respectively). Conclusions. This study shows that the urine 8-OHdG levels increase in diabetic patients. However, urinary 8-OHdG is not a useful clinical marker, compared with UACR, to predict the development of diabetic nephropathy in diabetic patients.

AB  - The pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is complex owing to molecular heterogeneity in the afflicted population. Current diagnostic methods rely on blood glucose measurements, which are noninformative with respect to progression of the disease to other associated pathologies. Thus, predicting the risk and development of T2DM-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease, remains a major challenge. We have used a combination of quantitative methods for characterization of circulating serum biomarkers of T2DM using a cohort of nondiabetic control subjects (n = 76) and patients diagnosed with T2DM (n = 106). In this case control study, the samples were randomly divided as training and validation data sets. In the first step, iTRAQ (isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantification) based protein expression profiling was performed for identification of proteins displaying a significant differential expression in the two study groups. Five of these protein markers were selected for validation using multiple reaction-monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) and further confirmed with Western blot and QPCR analysis. Functional pathway analysis identified perturbations in lipid and small molecule metabolism as well as pathways that lead to disruption of glucose homeostasis and blood coagulation. These putative biomarkers may be clinically useful for subset stratification of T2DM patients as well as for the development of novel therapeutics targeting the specific pathology.

AB  - Background: The aim of the study was to optimize protocols for finding and identifying serum proteins that are differentially expressed in persons with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) compared to individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
   Serum from persons with NGT and persons with T2DM was profiled using ProteinChip arrays and time-of-flight mass spectra were generated by surface enhanced laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS).
   Results: Mass spectra from NGT- and T2DM-groups were compared. Fifteen proteins ranging from 5 to 79 kDa were differentially expressed (p < 0.05). Five of these proteins showed decreased and ten showed increased serum levels in individuals with T2DM. To be able to identify the proteins, the complexity of the sample was reduced by fractionation approaches. Subsequently, the purified fractions containing biomarkers were separated by one- dimensional SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in two identical lanes. Protein bands of the first lane were excised and subjected to passive elution to recapture the biomarkers on ProteinChip arrays. The corresponding bands of the second lane were subjected to peptide-mass fingerprinting (PMF). Using this approach four of the differentially expressed proteins were identified as apolipoprotein C3 (9.4 kDa), transthyretin (13.9 kDa), albumin (66 kDa) and transferrin (79 kDa). Whereas apolipoprotein C3 and transthyretin were up-regulated, albumin and transferrin were downregulated in T2DM.
   Conclusion: Protocols for protein profiling by SELDI- TOF MS and protein identification by fractionation, SDS- PAGE and PMF were optimized for serum from humans with T2DM. With these protocols differentially expressed proteins were discovered and identified when serum from NGT-and T2DM-individuals was analyzed.

AB  - The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasing globally, creating essential demands for T2DM animal models for the study of disease pathogenesis, prevention, and therapy. A non-human primate model such as cynomolgus monkeys can develop T2DM spontaneously in an age-dependent way similar to humans. In this study, a data-independent acquisition-based quantitative proteomics strategy was employed to investigate the serum proteomic profiles of spontaneously diabetic cynomolgus monkeys compared with healthy controls. The results revealed significant differences in protein abundances. A total of 95 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were quantitatively identified in the current study, among which 31 and 64 proteins were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that carbohydrate digestion and absorption was the top enriched pathway by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Protein- protein interaction network analysis demonstrated that MST1 was identified as the most connected protein in the network and could be considered as the hub protein. MST1 was significantly and inversely associated with FSG and HbA1c. Furthermore, recent lines of evidence also indicate that MST1 acts as a crucial regulator in regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis to maintain metabolic homeostasis while simultaneously suppressing the inflammatory processes. In conclusion, our study provides novel insights into serum proteome changes in spontaneously diabetic cynomolgus monkeys and points out that the dysregulation of several DEPs may play an important role in the pathogenesis of T2DM.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), a major TB risk factor, are both accompanied by marked alterations in metabolic processes. Dissecting the specific metabolic changes induced by disease through metabolomics has shown potential to improve our understanding of relevant pathophysiological mechanisms of disease, which could lead to improved treatment. Targeted tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to compare amine and acylcarnitine levels in plasma samples of patients with TB or TB-DM from Indonesia at time of diagnosis and during antibiotic treatment. Partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) showed good separation of patient groups. Amine levels were strongly altered in both disease groups compared to healthy controls, including low concentrations of citrulline and ornithine. Several amino acid ratios discriminated TB from controls (phenylalanine/histidine; citrulline/arginine; kynurenine/tryptophan), possibly reflecting changes in indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Choline, glycine, serine, threonine and homoserine levels were lower in TB-DM compared to TB, and, in contrast to other analytes, did not normalize to healthy control levels during antibiotic treatment. Our results not only provide important validation of previous studies but also identify novel biomarkers, and significantly enhance our understanding of metabolic changes in human TB and TB-DM.

AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN), as the one of most common complications of diabetes, is generally diagnosed based on a longstanding duration, albuminuria, and decreased kidney function. Some patients with the comorbidities of diabetes and other primary renal diseases have similar clinical features to DN, which is defined as non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD). It is necessary to distinguish between DN and NDRD, considering they differ in their pathological characteristics, treatment regimes, and prognosis. Renal biopsy provides a gold standard; however, it is difficult for this to be conducted in all patients. Therefore, it is necessary to discover non-invasive biomarkers that can distinguish between DN and NDRD. In this research, the urinary exosomes were isolated from the midstream morning urine based on ultracentrifugation combined with 0.22 mu m membrane filtration. Data-independent acquisition-based quantitative proteomics were used to define the proteome profile of urinary exosomes from DN (n = 12) and NDRD (n = 15) patients diagnosed with renal biopsy and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients without renal damage (n = 9), as well as healthy people (n = 12). In each sample, 3372 +/- 722.1 proteins were identified on average. We isolated 371 urinary exosome proteins that were significantly and differentially expressed between DN and NDRD patients, and bioinformatic analysis revealed them to be mainly enriched in the immune and metabolic pathways. The use of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression further identified phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase domain containing 1 (PHYHD1) as the differential diagnostic biomarker, the efficacy of which was verified with another cohort including eight DN patients, five NDRD patients, seven T2DM patients, and nine healthy people. Additionally, a concentration above 1.203 mu g/L was established for DN based on the ELISA method. Furthermore, of the 19 significantly different expressed urinary exosome proteins selected by using the protein-protein interaction network and LASSO logistic regression, 13 of them were significantly related to clinical indicators that could reflect the level of renal function and hyperglycemic management.

AB  - Background: Surface-enhanced laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDITOF/MS), a laboratory-friendly technique, is used to identify biomarkers for cancer. The aim of the present study was to explore the application of SELDI proteomic patterns in serum for distinguishing between cases of pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy controls.
   Methods: Sera from 12 healthy controls, 24 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 126 with pancreatic cancer, including 84 with diabetes, and 61 with chronic pancreatitis, 32 of which were diabetics, were analyzed using SELDI-TOF/MS. Spectra (IMAC-30) were clustered and classified using Biomarker Wizard and Biomarker Pattern software.
   Results: Two decision tree classification algorithms, one with and one without CA 19-9, were constructed. In the absence of CA 19-9, the splitting protein peaks were: m/z 1526, 1211, and 3519; when CA 19-9 was used in the analysis, it replaced the m/z 3519 splitter. The two algorithms performed equally for classifying patients. A classification tree that considered diabetic patients only was constructed; the main splitters were: 1211, CA 19-9, 7903, 3359, 1802. With this algorithm, 100% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 97% with chronic pancreatitis and 77% of patients with pancreatic cancer were correctly classified. SELDITOF/MS features improved the diagnostic accuracy of CA 19-9 (AUC = 0.883 for CA 19-9; AUC = 0.935 for CA 19-9 and SELDI-TOF/MS features combined).
   Conclusions: SELDI-TOF/MS allows identification of new peptides which, in addition to CA 19-9, enable the correct classification of the vast majority of patients with pancreatic cancer, which can be distinguished from patients with chronic pancreatitis or type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Though the relationship between dietary fiber and physical health has been investigated widely, the use of dietary fiber from marine plants has been investigated relatively rarely. The Saccharina japonica byproducts after the production of algin contain a large amount of insoluble polysaccharide, which will cause a waste of resources if ignored. Soluble dietary fiber (SDF)prepared from waste byproducts of Saccharina japonica by alkaline hydrolysis method for the first time had a wrinkled microscopic surface and low crystallinity, which not only significantly reduced liver index, serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine amiotransferase (ALT), and liver fat accumulation damage to the livers of obese diabetic mice, but also activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to increase liver glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. By LC-MS/MS employing a Nexera UPLC tandem QE high-resolution mass spectrometer, the 6 potential biomarker metabolites were screened, namely glycerophosphocholine (GPC), phosphocholine (PCho), pantothenic acid, glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and betaine; several pathways of these metabolites were associated with lipid metabolism, glycogen metabolism, and amino acid metabolism in the liver were observed. This study further provided a detailed insight into the mechanisms of SDF from Saccharina japonica byproducts in regulating the livers of obese mice with type 2 diabetes and laid a reliable foundation for the further development and utilization of Saccharina japonica.

AB  - Background Using untargeted metabolomics techniques, the goal of the study is to differentially screen serum and feces metabolite profiles of spontaneously diabetic and healthy cynomolgus monkeys, to explore potential serum and fecal biomarkers and analyze affected metabolic pathways. Methods We adopted the diagnostic criteria for T2DM recommended by ADA for humans: FSG >= 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dl) and HbA1c >= 6.5%. The serum and feces samples from three diagnosed spontaneously T2DM cynomolgus monkeys and 11 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. We employed LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomic methods to reveal the differential metabolite profiles of serum and feces samples between the two groups and to analyze the affected metabolic pathways in MetaboAnalyst 5.0 based on KEGG library. Results Six and 44 differential metabolites were identified in serum and feces samples, respectively, and the corresponding affected commonly metabolic pathways involved several metabolic ways, such as arginine biosynthesis, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, and histidine metabolism. Conclusion The differential potential serum and feces biomarkers obtained from the LC-MS/MS based untargeted metabolomic may help to explain the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of T2DM and offer pivotal information for the early diagnosis and treatment of DM.

AB  - Highly efficient extraction of peptides from serum is critical for finding serum biomarkers using mass spectrometry, which still remains a great challenge. Currently, a bottom-up proteomics approach has been applied to discover serum biomarkers. However, the approach was labor intensive, time and cost consuming, and cannot meet the requirements for clinical application. In this work, Fe3O4/C@MIL-100 composites were synthesized to efficiently capture peptides from microwave-assisted formic acid digests of BSA and human serum prior to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Fe3O4/C@MIL-100 composites exhibited size-selective adsorption performance, thus providing a rapid and convenient approach to enrich low-abundance peptides. Notably, the peptides' mass fingerprinting of serum digestions between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and healthy persons were distinguishable, which indicated the potential ability of this technique for T2DM diagnosis and rapid biomarker discovery.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis Type 2 diabetes mellitus is known to contribute to the development of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, identifying HFpEF in individuals with type 2 diabetes early on is often challenging due to a limited array of biomarkers. This study aims to investigate specific biomarkers associated with the progression of HFpEF in individuals with type 2 diabetes, for the purpose of enabling early detection and more effective management strategies. Methods Blood samples were collected from individuals with type 2 diabetes, both with and without HFpEF, for proteomic analysis. Plasma integrin alpha 1 (ITGA1) levels were measured and compared between the two groups. Participants were further categorised based on ITGA1 levels and underwent detailed transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and during a median follow-up period of 30 months. Multivariable linear and Cox regression analyses were conducted separately to assess the associations between plasma ITGA1 levels and changes in echocardiography indicators and re-hospitalisation risk. Additionally, proteomic data for the individuals' left ventricles, from ProteomeXchange database, were analysed to uncover mechanisms underlying the change in ITGA1 levels in HFpEF. Results Individuals with type 2 diabetes and HFpEF showed significantly higher plasma ITGA1 levels than the individuals with type 2 diabetes without HFpEF. These elevated ITGA1 levels were associated with left ventricular remodelling and impaired diastolic function. Furthermore, during a median follow-up of 30 months, multivariable analysis revealed that elevated ITGA1 levels independently correlated with deterioration of both diastolic and systolic cardiac functions. Additionally, higher baseline plasma ITGA1 levels independently predicted re-hospitalisation risk (HR 2.331 [95% CI 1.387, 3.917], p=0.001). Proteomic analysis of left ventricular myocardial tissue provided insights into the impact of increased ITGA1 levels on cardiac fibrosis-related pathways and the contribution made by these changes to the development and progression of HFpEF. Conclusions/interpretation ITGA1 serves as a biomarker for monitoring cardiac structural and functional damage, can be used to accurately diagnose the presence of HFpEF, and can be used to predict potential deterioration in cardiac structure and function as well as re-hospitalisation for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Its measurement holds promise for facilitating risk stratification and early intervention to mitigate the adverse cardiovascular effects associated with diabetes.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is caused by the failure of the pancreatic beta-cell to secrete sufficient insulin to compensate a decreased response of peripheral tissues to insulin action. The pathological events causing beta-cell dysfunctions are only poorly understood and earl), markers that would predict islet function are missing. In contrast to immunoassays, unbiased proteomic technologies provide the opportunity to screen for novel marker protein and peptides of T2DM. An important subset of the proteome. peptides and peptide hormones secreted by the pancreas are deregulated in T2DM. The mass range of peptides and small proteins (1-20 kDa) is only sufficiently targeted by peptidomics, a combination of liquid chromatographic and mass spectrometric (MS) peptide analysis. Here, we describe the application of isotope label-free quantitative peptidomics to display and quantify relevant changes in the level of pancreatic peptides and peptide hormones in a preclinical model of T2DM, the Lep(ob)/Lep(ob) mouse. The amino acid sequence of statistical relevant top candidates was determined by MS/MS fragmentation or Edman degradation. The comparison of lean versus obese mice revealed increased levels of islet-specific peptides that can be divided into the following categories 1) the major islet peptide hormones insulin, amylin and glucagon; 2) proinsulin and C-peptide and 3) novel processing products of secretogranin, glucagon and amylin. Furthermore. we found increased levels of proteins and peptides implicated in zymogen granule maturation (syncollin) and nutritional digestion. In summary, our findings demonstrate that peptidomics is a valid approach to screen for novel peptide biomarkers.

AB  - Background:Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus that leads to end-stage renal disease. Hyperglycemia triggers apoptosis and kidney damage. Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) and TAM receptor tyrosine kinases, Tyro3, Axl, and Mer, are phagocytic receptors that mediate the clearance of apoptotic cells. This study aimed to identify the role of MFG-E8 and TAM receptors in the development of DN.Methods:A total of 146 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), early stage DN, clinical DN and 48 healthy controls were employed to analyze the serum levels of MFG-E8, soluble Tyro3, Axl, Mer, and RAGE by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The serum levels of CREA, hsCRP, CysC, and beta 2-microglobulin were measured by spectrophotometric analysis using a biochemical analyzer (AU5800).Results:Our results showed that the serum levels of MFG-E8 were elevated in patients with T2DM compared with healthy controls; however, it decreased gradually in patients with DN with the severity of kidney injury, especially in the clinical DN group. Moreover, the levels of sTyro3, sAxl, and sMer were reduced in patients with T2DM and DN compared to healthy controls, particularly in patients with DN. The levels of MFG-E8, sTyro3, sAxl, and sMer were negatively correlated with UAER at 24 hours, CREA, hsCRP, CysC, beta 2-microglobulin, and RAGE, respectively. In addition, TAM receptors had significantly higher predictive and diagnostic values for early stage DN from T2DM than hsCRP, beta 2-microglobulin, and CysC, which are also predictive biomarkers of early stage DN from clinical DN.Conclusions:Decreased MFG-E8 and TAM receptor expression is associated with an increased risk of microvascular complications in patients with T2DM, which plays a critical role in the diagnosis of diabetic patients with microvascular complications, especially early stage DN, and in monitoring the development of DN.

AB  - To identify circulating factors as candidates involved in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we conducted two different quantitative proteomic analyses: (1) db/db mouse sera were compared with db/+ mouse sera obtained at 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks of age, and (2) db/db mouse sera from animals treated with liraglutide were compared with sera from animals without liraglutide treatment. Twenty proteins were differentially expressed in db/db mouse sera in the first experiment and eight proteins were differentially expressed in db/db mouse sera after liraglutide treatment in the second experiment. Soluble epidermal growth factor receptor (sEGFR) was identified as a common factor, and its protein level was significantly affected in both experiments. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed that the relatively low serum sEGFR levels in db/db mice were restored by liraglutide treatment. The serum sEGFR levels were elevated in diabetic mice with impaired insulin secretion and decreased in high-fat diet-fed mice and ob/ob mice. The serum sEGFR levels increased after the administration of a dual inhibitor of IGF-1/insulin receptor or streptozotocin. In humans with normal glucose tolerance or T2DM, the serum sEGFR levels were correlated with the fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, HbA1c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides levels. These findings suggest that sEGFR might be a biomarker for evaluating insulin resistance or a therapeutic target of liraglutide.We conducted serum proteomics using db/db mice, and identified epidermal growth factor receptor as a marker of diabetes.

AB  - Objective: The clinical research on BH4 is limited because of the difficulties on its measurement. In this study, we used our own established LC-MS/MS method to examine the plasma BH4 levels in diabetes to determine whether it could be used as a biomarker for the prediction of kidney injury in those patients. Methods: Hospitalized diabetes patients in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan to Aug 2021 were recruited. To assess the association between plasma BH4 with ACR or eGFR in diabetes, a total of 142 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) were enrolled. They were divided into three groups by albuminuria levels: normoalbuminuria (n = 68), microalbuminuria (n = 48), and macroalbuminuria (n = 26) according to ACR; or into two groups by eGFR: eGFR 0.001) and CP-2h (B = -0.257, P = 0.028) were independently associated with ACR progression. ROC curve showed that BH4 level has a predictive value on ACR (95%CI 0.686-0.841, sensitivity 69.1%, specificity 73%). Moreover, in diabetes patients with eGFR 90 ml/min, plasma BH4 level (P = 0.008) is higher than those in diabetes with eGFR<90 ml/min and BH4 was remained independently associated with eGFR after multivariable logistic regression analysis (B = -0.193, P = 0.048). Conclusion: Our established LC-MS/MS method could be used on human plasma BH4 measurements and our data suggested that BH4 level can be used as a biomarker for kidney injury in diabetes indicated by its association with ACR progression and early renal function decline.

AB  - Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a severe and common complication and affects a quarter of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Oxidative stress and inflammation related to hyperglycemia are interlinked and contribute to the occurrence of DKD. It was shown that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a novel yet already widely used therapy, may prevent the development of DKD and alter its natural progression. SGLT2 inhibitors induce systemic and glomerular hemodynamic changes, provide metabolic advantages, and reduce inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. In T2DM patients, regardless of cardiovascular diseases, SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce albuminuria, progression of DKD, and doubling of serum creatinine levels, thus lowering the need for kidney replacement therapy by over 40%. The molecular mechanisms behind these beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors extend beyond their glucose-lowering effects. The emerging studies are trying to explain these mechanisms at the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels.

AB  - Objective: Diabetic Keratopathy (DK) is one of the significant complications of type II diabetes (T2DM) with pathogenesis not yet clarified. Since hyperglycemia is able to change the protein components contained in plasma exosomes, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is considered as feasible to analyze the expression of plasma exosomal proteins in patients with T2DM and non-diabetic patients respec-tively, find critical biological markers, and explore the mechanism of DK as well as potential therapeutic targets. Method: Blood and clinical information of corneal epithelial injury in a diabetic group (the study group) and a non-diabetic group (the control group), who were patients admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology, Yangpu Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine from July 2020 to November 2020, were collected. The qEV size exclusion method was adopted to separate exosomes from plasma. The exosomes were then identified through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analyzer (NTA), and Western blot. The plasma exosomes of the study group and the control group were quantitatively analyzed by proteomics. A bioinformatics method is utilized to screen differential proteins and the expression of the differential proteins was verified by Western blot. Result: TEM indicated that the exosomes had a double-concave disc-like appearance, with a size of about 100 nm, and Western blot expressed as CD63 and TSG101. The plasma exosomes of the study group and the control group were analyzed by quantitative proteomics with a total number of 952 proteins detected of which 245 proteins existed in the ExoCarta exosomal protein database. Through adoption of P-value to screen credible differential proteins, the heat map displayed 28 differential proteins, 7 upregulated proteins, and 21 downregulated proteins; the volcano map displayed 7 upregulated proteins and 22 downregulated proteins; the PPI interaction map displayed 12 upregulated proteins and 18 downregulated proteins. Through GO enrichment analysis, it was identified that the differential protein participated in the main biological processes and was involved in regu-lating the cell's stimulation response to insulin, the insulin receptor signaling pathway, and the activity of glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase D as well as anti-oxidation. The enriched cell components include main components such as exosomes, blood particles, and cytoplasm. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the target protein FLOT2 was mainly concentrated in insulin-related signaling pathways. Western blot indicated that the expression of FLOT2 in the study group was lower compared with the control group while the expression of Exo70 was higher. Conclusion: Proteomic analysis of the study group and the control group displayed a variety of proteins in plasma exosomes. The downregulated protein FLOT2 in the study group was closely related to the occurrence, devel-opment, and complication of DK in T2DM patients. The expression status of plasma FLOT2 protein in T2DM patients is expected to be a biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring of DK.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current study aims to reconnoiter the outcome of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) on levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and pro -inflam-matory chemokine in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of individuals undergoing fixed orthodon-tic treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were divided into a diabetic and no-diabetic group according to inclusion and exclusion cri-teria. Power analysis was adopted from a pre-vious study that reported GCF chemokines in obese individuals. All teeth were measured for clinical periodontal parameters (CPP). GCF and saliva were collected 3 months after placing stainless steel archwire. GCF was investigated for pro-inflammatory cytokines all expressed in pg/mL. Quantification of chemokines was per-formed using a Magnetic bead-based multiplex assay for the Luminex (R) platform. Non-normality of data was assessed by Mann-Whitney U-test. Normality was estimated using an Independent t-test. Descriptive data were computed in the form of standard deviations and means. RESULTS: Unstimulated whole saliva flow rate (UWSFR) was significantly lower in diabet-ic patients compared to non-diabetics (p=.021). Amongst different clinical periodontal parame-ters (CPP) no difference in plaque scores (PS) and probing depth (PD) was found between di-abetic and non-diabetic participants. Two GCF chemokines i.e., Resistin (p=.031) and AGEs (p=.017) were observed to be significantly high-er in DMT2 participants compared to the non -di-abetes group. CPP and GCF biomarkers in dia-betic and non-diabetic individuals demonstrat-ed a positive correlation between AGEs and GCF resistin levels concerning bleeding on probing (BoP) in diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with DMT2 af-ter alignment with an orthodontic device exhib-ited significantly high levels of resistin and AG -Es. The proinflammatory response was noted in patients with hyperglycemia undergoing ortho-dontic treatment.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD)the leading cause of death in the United States. Yet not all subjects with T2DM are at equal risk for CVD complications; the challenge lies in identifying those at greatest risk. Therapies directed toward treating conventional risk factors have failed to significantly reduce this residual risk in T2DM patients. Thus newer targets and markers are needed for the development and testing of novel therapies. Herein we review two complementary MS-based approachesmass spectrometric immunoassay (MSIA) and MS/MS as MRMfor the analysis of plasma proteins and PTMs of relevance to T2DM and CVD. Together, these complementary approaches allow for high-throughput monitoring of many PTMs and the absolute quantification of proteins near the low picomolar range. In this review article, we discuss the clinical relevance of the high density lipoprotein (HDL) proteome and Apolipoprotein A-I PTMs to T2DM and CVD as well as provide illustrative MSIA and MRM data on HDL proteins from T2DM patients to provide examples of how these MS approaches can be applied to gain new insight regarding cardiovascular risk factors. Also discussed are the reproducibility, interpretation, and limitations of each technique with an emphasis on their capacities to facilitate the translation of new biomarkers into clinical practice.

AB  - Background: As a damage-associated molecular pattern protein, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is associated with kidney and systemic inflammation. The predictive and therapeutic value of HMGB1 as a biomarker has been confirmed in various diseases. However, its value in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the correlation between serum and urine HMGB1 levels and DKD progression. Methods: We recruited 196 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including 109 with DKD and 87 T2DM patients without DKD. Additionally, 60 healthy participants without T2DM were also recruited as controls. Serum and urine samples were collected for HMGB1 analysis. Simultaneously, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFR-1) in serum and kidney injury molecule (KIM-1) in urine samples were evaluated for comparison. Results: Serum and urine HMGB1 levels were significantly higher in patients with DKD than in patients with T2DM and healthy controls. Additionally, serum HMGB1 levels significantly and positively correlated with serum TNFR-1 (R-2 = 0.567, p<0.001) and urine KIM-1 levels (R-2 = 0.440, p<0.001), and urine HMGB1 has a similar correlation. In the population with T2DM, the risk of DKD progression increased with an increase in serum HMGB1 levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that elevated serum HMGB1 level was an independent risk factor for renal function progression in patients with DKD, and regression analysis did not change in the model corrected for multiple variables. The restricted cubic spline depicted a nonlinear relationship between serum HMGB1 and renal function progression in patients with DKD (p-nonlinear=0.007, p<0.001), and this positive effect remained consistent across subgroups. Conclusion: Serum HMGB1 was significantly correlated with DKD and disease severity. When the HMGB1 level was >= 27 ng/ml, the risk of renal progression increased sharply, indicating that serum HMGB1 can be used as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of DKD progression.

AB  - Ageing is a complex process which implies the accumulation of molecular, cellular and organ damage, leading to an increased vulnerability to disease. In Western societies, the increase in the elderly population, which is accompanied by ageing-associated pathologies such as cardiovascular and mental diseases, is becoming an increasing economic and social burden for governments. In order to prevent, treat and determine which subjects are more likely to develop these age-related diseases, predictive biomarkers are required. In this sense, some studies suggest that glycans have a potential role as disease biomarkers, as they modify the functions of proteins and take part in intra- and intercellular biological processes. As the glycome reflects the real-time status of these interactions, its characterisation can provide potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for multifactorial diseases. This review gathers the alterations in protein glycosylation profiles that are associated with ageing and age-related diseases, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and several chronic inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, the review includes the available techniques for the determination and characterisation of glycans, such as liquid chromatography, electrophoresis, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.

AB  - Background: The hepatokine fetuin-A, released by the human liver, promotes pro-inflammatory effects of perivascular fat. The involvement of inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can affect the kidney and contribute to the development of diabetic kidney disease. Therefore we examined the association of urinary fetuin-A protein fragments with renal damage in T2DM patients.
   Methods: Urinary peptides of 1491 individuals using proteome data available from the human urine proteome database were analysed. Prediction of proteases involved in urinary peptide generation was performed using the Proteasix tool.
   Results: We identified 14 different urinary protein fragments that belong to the region of the connecting peptide (amino acid 301-339) of the total fetuin-A protein. Calpains (CAPN1 and CAPN2), matrix metalloproteinase and pepsin A-3 were identified as potential proteases that were partially confirmed by previous in vitro studies. Combined fetuin-A peptides (mean of amplitudes) were significantly increased in T2DM patients with kidney disease and to a lesser extent with cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, fetuin-A peptide levels displayed a significant negative correlation with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values (r=-0.316, P<0.0001) and with the slope (%) of eGFR per year (r=-0.096, P=0.023). A multiple regression model including fetuin-A peptide and albuminuria resulted in a significantly improved correlation with eGFR (r=-0.354, P<0.0001) compared with albuminuria, indicating an added value of this novel biomarker.
   Conclusions: The urinary proteome analysis demonstrated the association of fetuin-A peptides with impaired kidney function in T2DM patients. Furthermore, fetuin-A peptides displayed early signs of kidney damage before albuminuria appeared and therefore can be used as markers for kidney disease detection.

AB  - Early detection of insulin resistance (IR) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is crucial for delaying and preventing the progression toward type 2 diabetes. We recently developed and validated a straightforward metabolite-based test for the assessment of IR and IGT in a single LC-MS/MS method. Plasma samples were diluted with isotopically-labeled internal standards and extracted by simple protein precipitation. The extracts were analyzed by LC-MS/MS for the quantitation of 2-hydroxybutyric acid (0.500-40.0 mu g/mL), 3-hydroxybutyric acid (1.00-80.0 mu g/mL), 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid (0.500-20.0 mu g/mL), 1-linoleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (2.50-100 mu g/mL),oleic acid (10.0-400 mu g/mL), pantothenic acid (0.0100-0.800 mu g/mL), and serine (2.50-100 mu g/mL). Liquid chromatography was carried out on a reversed phase column with a run time of 3.1 min and the mass spectrometer operated in negative MRM mode. Method validation was performed on three identical LC-MS/MS systems with five runs each. Sufficient linearity (R-2 > 0.99) was observed for all the analytes over the ranges. The imprecision (CVs) was found to be less than 5.5% for intra-run and less than 5.8% for inter-run for the seven analytes. The analytical recovery was determined to be between 96.3 and 103% for the seven analytes. This fast and robust method has subsequently been used for patient sample analysis for the assessment of IR and IGT. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data-dependent liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry is challenged by the large concentration range of proteins in plasma and related fluids. We adapted the SCoPE method from single-cell proteomics to pericardial fluid, where a myocardial tissue carrier was used to aid protein quantification. The carrier proteome and patient samples were labeled with distinct isobaric labels, which allowed separate quantification. Undepleted pericardial fluid from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or heart failure undergoing heart surgery was analyzed with either a traditional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method or with the carrier proteome. In total, 1398 proteins were quantified with a carrier, compared to 265 without, and a higher proportion of these proteins were of myocardial origin. The number of differentially expressed proteins also increased nearly four-fold. For patients with both heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus, pathway analysis of upregulated proteins demonstrated the enrichment of immune activation, blood coagulation, and stress pathways. Overall, our work demonstrates the applicability of a carrier for enhanced protein quantification in challenging biological matrices such as pericardial fluid, with potential applications for biomarker discovery. Mass spectrometry data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD053450.

AB  - Objective
   To monitor of type 2 diabetes more simply, conveniently and noninvasively, we are trying to identify the potential urinary peptides that associated with different stages of glucose control in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
   Methods
   Firstly, we collected urine samples from type 2 diabetic patients and normal controls. These type 2 diabetic patients were divided into two groups according to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c% (HbA1c), respectively. Magnetic beads based weak cation exchange chromatography (MB-WCX) was used to condense urinary peptides. The eluates were then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Subsequently, ClinProt was used to profile and screen the polypeptide patterns based on different methods of grouping in diabetic patients and normal controls. Finally, the amino acid sequences of differentially expressed peptides were identified by nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and the protein sources of the corresponding peptide were matched in IPI Human database.
   Results
   Proteomics analysis found two up-regulated peptide (m/z 2756.1 and m/z 3223.2) representations in diabetic subjects, and the two peptides increased with increases in the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin. Further, the parallelism between m/z 3223.2 and glycosylated hemoglobin was better than the parallelism between m/z 2756.1 and glycosylated hemoglobin. Area under the receiver operating characteristic of the two peptides was 0.722 and 0.661, respectively. The above-mentioned peptide m/z 2756.1 was further identified as fragment of fibrinogen alpha chain precursor and m/z 3223.2 was fragment of prothrombin precusor.
   Conclusion
   These results suggested the two urinary biomarkers enable monitor of type 2 diabetes patients with different stages of glucose control.

AB  - Aim: Recombinant FGF21 analogs are under wide ranging investigations as a potential therapeutic agent for Type 2 diabetes, as well as other metabolic disorders. The endogenous FGF21 is often used as a surrogate pharmacodynamic(PD) biomarker to assess drug efficacy and safety. Results & methodology: Immunocapture was performed using a monoclonal antibody which had been generated to bind to specific domain of native FGF21 as the capture reagent. After immunocapture, enzymatic digestion was performed and a native FGF21-specific tryptic peptide was monitored using LC-MS/MS by selective reaction monitoring. Conclusion: We have successfully developed and validated a bioanalytical assay which provides the specificity to differentiate the endogenous FGF21 from the recombinant therapeutic agent which has nearly identical sequence to the endogenous molecule.

AB  - Background: To identify low molecular weight urinary proteins capable of detecting diabetic nephropathy patients which may predict renal alterations at early stages and prevent it from worsening further.
   Method: Three hundred ninety (390) age-matched subjects were divided into 8 groups depending upon duration of diabetes and the severity of renal damage. Urinary proteome profile of all subjects was determined with the help of microfluidic array. Participants with similar profile were further selected to study proteome map of urinary low molecular weight proteins with the help of 2 dimensional gel electrophoresis.
   Results: Out of 390 total patients 268 patients showed a similar one dimensional proteomic pattern. Further, two-dimensional urinary proteomic pattern of these patients with molecular weight<50kDa was studied. Eight proteins with molecular weight 11, 15, 17, 23, 34, 38 and 46kDa were identified with MALDI-QTOF. These low molecular weight proteins showed gradual increase in urinary excretion along with the duration of diabetes and severity of renal damage.
   Conclusion: The study concludes that proteomic analysis might be a useful tool for detecting some novel markers capable of detecting patients susceptible to diabetic nephropathy in the early phase.

AB  - Introduction: Post-translational modifications (PTMs) have an important role in the regulation of protein function, localization, and interaction with other molecules. PTMs apply a dynamic control of proteins in both physiological and pathological conditions. The study of disease-specific PTMs allows identifying potential biomarkers and developing effective drugs. Enrichment techniques combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS)/MS analysis provide attractive results on PTM characterization. Selected reaction monitoring/multiple reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) is a powerful targeted assay for the quantitation and validation of PTMs in complex biological samples.Areas covered: The most frequent PTMs are described in terms of biological role and analytical methods commonly used to detect them. The applications of SRM/MRM for the absolute quantitation of PTMs are reported, and a specific section is focused on PTM detection in proteins that are involved in the cardiovascular system and heart diseases.Expert commentary: PTM characterization in relation to disease pathology is still in progress, but targeted proteomics by LC-MS/MS has significantly upgraded our knowledge in the last few years. Advances in enrichment strategies and software tools will facilitate the interpretation of high PTM complexity. Promising studies confirm the great potential of SRM/MRM to study PTMs in the cardiovascular field, and PTMomics could be very useful in the clinical perspective.

AB  - We aimed to simultaneously examine the associations of both essential and non-essential amino acids with both prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population. A case-control study was nested within the Singapore Chinese Health Study. Participants included 144 cases with prevalent and 160 cases with incident type 2 diabetes and 304 controls. Cases and controls were individually matched on age, sex, and date of blood collection. Baseline serum levels of 9 essential and 10 non-essential amino acids were measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We identified that five essential (isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, and valine) and five non-essential (alanine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, and tyrosine) amino acids were associated with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes; four essential (isoleucine, leucine, tryptophan, and valine) and two non-essential (glutamine and tyrosine) amino acids were associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Of these, valine and tyrosine independently led to a significant improvement in risk prediction of incident type 2 diabetes. This study demonstrates that both essential and non-essential amino acids were associated with the risk for prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes, and the findings could aid in diabetes risk assessment in this Chinese population.

AB  - With the rapid advancement of proteomics, numerous scholars have investigated the intricate relationships between plasma proteins and various diseases. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the relationship between BDH1 and type 2 diabetes using Mendelian randomization (MR) and to identify novel targets for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes through proteomics. This study primarily employed the Mendelian Randomization (MR) method, leveraging genetic data from numerous large-scale, publicly accessible genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Within this framework, we adopted a two-step, two-sample MR approach to evaluate the relationships between BDH1, plasma proteins, and type 2 diabetes. Finally, we conducted bidirectional MR analyses along with various sensitivity analyses to ensure the robustness and reliability of the study findings. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) analysis demonstrated that for each 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in BDH1, the risk of type 2 diabetes decreased by 3% (OR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95, 0.99). Concurrently, the proteomics-based MR analysis identified 37 plasma proteins associated with type 2 diabetes and 27 plasma proteins associated with BDH1. Notably, NBN, ARG1, and CCL11 were found to mediate the protective effect of BDH1 on type 2 diabetes. Our research findings uncovered the potential protective effect of BDH1 on type 2 diabetes and identified several plasma proteins associated with the disease. These results open new avenues for enhanced exploration of the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT Metformin, a biguanide glucose lowering agent, is commonly used to manage type 2 diabetes. The molecular mechanisms of metformin have not been fully identified, but turnover of biomarkers such as glucose and signalling pathways or translocation of glucose transporters are closely related to the glucose-lowering effects of metformin. The PK/PD of metformin have been investigated in healthy humans and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and modelling has been performed using an indirect response model. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS The purpose of this investigation was to develop a population PK/PD model for metformin using a signal transduction model in healthy humans and predict the PK/PD profile in patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim was to compare a previous model (a biophase model) with the signal transduction model, and use a more appropriate model to follow the actions of metformin. Additionally, our developed model was appropriate to predict the time course of plasma metformin and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes. To our knowledge, this is the first published population PK/PD analysis using the signal transduction model for metformin. AIMS To develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) model for metformin (500 mg) using the signal transduction model in healthy humans and to predict the PK/PD profile in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS Following the oral administration of 500 mg metformin to healthy humans, plasma concentrations of metformin were measured using LC-MS/MS. A sequential modelling approach using NONMEM VI was used to facilitate data analysis. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to predict the antihyperglycaemic effect in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS Forty-two healthy humans were included in the study. Population mean estimates (relative standard error, RSE) of apparent clearance, apparent volume of distribution and the absorption rate constant were 52.6 l h-1 (4.18%), 113 l (56.6%) and 0.41 h-1, respectively. Covariate analyses revealed that creatinine clearance (CLCR) significantly influenced metformin: CL/F= 52.6 x (CLcr/106.5)0.782. The signal transduction model was applied to describe the antihyperglycaemic effect of metformin. The population means for efficacy, potency, transit time and the Hill coefficient were estimated to be 19.8 (3.17%), 3.68 mu g ml-1 (3.89%), 0.5 h (2.89%) and 0.547 (9.05%), respectively. The developed model was used to predict the antihyperglycaemic effect in patients with type 2 diabetes. The predicted plasma glucose concentration value was similar to previous values. CONCLUSIONS The population signal transduction model was developed and evaluated for metformin use in healthy volunteers. Model evaluation by non-parametric bootstrap analysis suggested that the proposed model was robust and parameter values were estimated with good precision.

AB  - Detailed insights into the biological functions of the liver and an understanding of its crosstalk with other human tissues and the gut microbiota can be used to develop novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of liver-associated diseases, including fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Biological network models, including metabolic, transcriptional regulatory, protein-protein interaction, signalling and co-expression networks, can provide a scaffold for studying the biological pathways operating in the liver in connection with disease development in a systematic manner. Here, we review studies in which biological network models were used to integrate multiomics data to advance our understanding of the pathophysiological responses of complex liver diseases. We also discuss how this mechanistic approach can contribute to the discovery of potential biomarkers and novel drug targets, which might lead to the design of targeted and improved treatment strategies. Finally, we present a roadmap for the successful integration of models of the liver and other human tissues with the gut microbiota to simulate whole-body metabolic functions in health and disease.

AB  - Diabetic vascular complications (DVC) are the main cause of death in diabetic patients. However, there is a lack of effective biomarkers or convenient methods for early diagnosis of DVC. In this study, the salivary glycopatterns from 130 of healthy volunteers (HV), 139 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 167 patients with DVC were case-by-case analyzed by using lectin microarrays. Subsequently, diagnostic models were developed using logistic regression and machine learning algorithms based on the data of lectin microarrays in training set. The performance of diagnostic models was evaluated in an independent blind cohort. The results of lectin microarrays indicated that the glycopatterns identified by 16 lectins (e.g. BS-I, PWM and EEL) were significantly altered in DVC patients compared with patients with T2DM, which suggested the alterations in salivary glycopatterns could reflect onset of DVC. Notably, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model exhibited better performance for distinguishing DVC (accuracy: 0.939) than other models in blind cohort. The integrated classifier, which combined three machine learning models, exhibited a higher overall accuracy (>= 0.933) than other models in blind cohort. Our study provided a cost-effective and non-invasive method for auxiliary diagnosis DVC based on the combination of salivary glycopatterns and machine learning algorithms.

AB  - Amadori peptides were enriched using boronate affinity tips and measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS). As demonstrated by electrochemical measurements, the tips show the highest binding efficiency for glucose at pH 8.2 employing ammonium chloride/ammonia buffer with ionic strength of 150 mM, exceeding taurine buffer at the same concentration. The bound constituents were released by sorbitol and formic acid. It was also demonstrated that elution with sorbitol at 1.2 M is superior to acidic media. Comparison of results was based on the numbers of detected peptides and their glycated sites. Using sorbitol for elution requires desalting prior to analysis. Therefore, three different sorbents were tested: fullerene-derivatized silica. ZipTip (C18), and C18 silica. Fullerene-derivatized silica and ZipTip showed the same performance regarding the numbers of glycated pepticles, and sites were better than C18 silica. The elaborated off-line method was compared with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) measurements, by which considerable less modified pepticles were detected. Affinity tips used under optimized conditions were tested for the analysis of human serum albumin (HSA) from sera of healthy and diabetic individuals. A peptide with a mass of 1783.9 Da could be detected only in samples of diabetic patients and, therefore, could be a very interesting biomarker candidate. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims: The appearance of low-molecular-weight (LMW) protein in the urine indicates any disruption in the structural integrity of the glomerular capillary wall; therefore, the presence of LMW protein may be a potential predictive marker for DN.Methods: The urine proteomic profiling of T2DM patients (n = 94) and control group (n = 32) was compared by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and the untargeted LMW protein was identified by Progenesis Q1 For Proteomics v4.2.Results: A total of 73 LMW proteins were identified and quantified, of which, 32 proteins were found to be altered significantly (p < 0.05). Further analysis with heat maps identified two potential proteins with the highest folding alterations in urine. V-ATPase subunit C 1 abundance was significantly inversely correlated with microalbumin and significantly decreased in urine, whereas increased IKBIP was positively correlated with microalbumin. The level of those proteins was significantly different among the control, T2DM, and DN groups, implying an association with the progression of DN.Conclusions: The present findings of our study indicate that the decreasing V-ATPase subunit C 1 together with increasing IKBIP in urine, were found to be closely associated with DN complications and signifying their value as biomarkers for predicting the risk of DN at initial diagnosis.

AB  - Purpose To investigate the association of plasma and vitreous leucine-rich-alpha 2-glycoprotein (LRG1) with diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression. Methods A total of 86 outpatients and 33 inpatients were recruited. Outpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were classified as T2DM without DR (n = 22), nonproliferative DR (NPDR) (n = 20) and proliferative DR (PDR) (n = 22) based on international clinical DR severity scales. A total of 86 plasma and 33 vitreous samples were collected and subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The diagnostic value of plasma LRG1 was tested using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results Plasma LRG1 in PDR patients (9025 +/- 1870 pg/ml) was significantly increased as compared with controls (5975 +/- 2022 pg/ml), T2DM without DR (6550 +/- 2359 pg/ml) and NPDR patients (6550 +/- 2359 pg/ml) (p < 0.0001). Vitreous LRG1 in PDR patients was elevated by approximately 4.3-fold than that in controls (562.1 +/- 273.5 ng/ml versus 130.0 +/- 102.8 ng/ml, p = 0.000). The area under the ROC curve value for plasma LRG1 was 0.786 (p < 0.0001). The maximal Youden index was 0.4372 and the optimal cut-off value of LRG1 was 7357.043 pg/ml with 81.82% sensitivity and 61.90% specificity. Conclusion Plasma and vitreous LRG1 levels were elevated in patients with PDR. Leucine-rich-alpha 2-glycoprotein (LRG1) might be a potential risk-warning marker for PDR.

AB  - Human saliva plays a pivotal role in digesting food and maintaining oral hygiene. The presence of electrolytes, mucus, glycoproteins, enzymes, antibacterial compounds, and gingival crevicular fluid in saliva ensures the optimum condition of oral cavity and general health condition. Saliva collection has been proven non-invasive, convenient, and inexpensive compared to conventional venipuncture procedure. These distinctive advantages provide a promising potential of saliva as a diagnostic fluid. Through comprehensive analysis, an array of salivary proteins and peptides may be beneficial as biomarkers in oral and systemic diseases. In this review, we discuss the utility of human salivary proteomes and tabulate the recent salivary biomarkers found in subjects with acute myocardial infarction as well as respective methods employed. In a clinical setting, since acute myocardial infarction contributes to large cases of mortality worldwide, an early intervention using these biomarkers will provide an effective solution to reduce global heart attack incidence particularly among its high-risk group of type-2 diabetes mellitus patients. The utility of salivary biomarkers will make the prediction of this cardiac event possible due to its reliability hence improve the quality of life of the patients. Current challenges in saliva collection are also addressed to improve the quality of saliva samples and produce robust biomarkers for future use in clinical applications.

AB  - Background The onset of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus often occurs early, leading to complications in young adulthood. Risk biomarkers associated with the early onset of DKD are urgently needed in youth with T2D. Methods We conducted an in-depth analysis of 6596 proteins (SomaScan 7K) in 374 baseline plasma samples from the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth study to identify multiprotein signatures associated with the onset of albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio >= 30 mg/g), a rapid decline in eGFR (annual eGFR decline >3 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and/or >= 3.3% at two consecutive visits), and hyperfiltration (>= 135 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at two consecutive visits). Elastic net Cox regression with ten-fold cross-validation was applied to the top 100 proteins (ranked by P value) to identify multiprotein signatures of time to development of DKD outcomes. Results Participants in the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth study (14 +/- 2 years, 63% female, 7 +/- 6 months diabetes duration) experienced high rates of early DKD: 43% developed albuminuria, 48% hyperfiltration, and 16% rapid eGFR decline. Increased levels of seven and three proteins were predictive of shorter time to develop albuminuria and rapid eGFR decline, respectively; 118 proteins predicted time to development of hyperfiltration. Elastic net Cox proportional hazards models identified multiprotein signatures of time to incident early DKD with concordance for models with clinical covariates and selected proteins between 0.81 and 0.96, whereas the concordance for models with clinical covariates only was between 0.56 and 0.63. Conclusions Our research sheds new light on proteomic changes early in the course of youth-onset T2D that associate with DKD. Proteomic analyses identified promising risk factors that predict DKD risk in youth with T2D and could deepen our understanding of DKD mechanisms and potential interventions.

KW  - NEPHROPATHY
AB  - Background: During the proteomic era, one of the most rapidly growing areas in biomedical research is biomarker discovery, particularly using proteomic technologies. The urinary proteome is known to be a valuable field of study and has become one of the most attractive subdisciplines in clinical proteomics for human diseases. We have described the levels of protein biomarkers specific to diabetes mellitus type 2 in the Pakistani population using proteomic technology.
   Methods: One hundred type 2 diabetes patients with 50 age-and sex-matched normal healthy controls were recruited from Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Urinary proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional liquid chromatography, using chromatofocusing in the first dimension and reverse-phase chromatography in the second, followed by mass spectrometric analysis. Levels of the proteins, which were found to vary in the diabetes type 2 patients compared to the controls, were then determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in all the samples.
   Results: Levels of transthyretin, alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor, and haptoglobin precursor decreased by 30.8%, 55.2%, and 81.45%, whereas levels of albumin, zinc alpha 2 glycoprotein, retinol binding protein 4, and E-cadherin increased by 486.5%, 29.23%, 100%, and 693%, respectively, in the diabetes patients compared to the controls.
   Conclusions: Variation in the levels of these identified protein biomarkers have been reported in other pathological states. Assessment of the levels of these biomarkers will be helpful not only in early diagnosis but also in prognosis of diabetes mellitus type 2.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a public health problem with a rising incidence worldwide. In this study, a potential new biomarker for T2D and mechanisms underlying the hypoglycemic effects of Enteromorpha prolifera oligosaccharide were investigated. Tandem mass tag labeling with LC-MS/MS was used to identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the jejunum of diabetic rats and control rats. Correlations between glycometabolic parameters and DEPs were revealed by a network analysis. The expression levels of target genes in key metabolic pathways were further evaluated to identify candidate biomarkers. Among 6810 total proteins, approximately 88 % were quantified, of which 148 DEPs with a fold change of <0.83 or>1.2 and a corrected p-value of <0.05 were identified. A KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the hypoglycaemic effects of E. prolifera oligosaccharide involved the PI3K/AKT and extracellular matrix receptor interaction signaling pathways. More importantly, Col1a1 was the most significant gene in the extracellular matrix receptor interaction pathway and was linked to hypoglycaemic activity for the first time. Thus, Col1a1 is a novel potential therapeutic target for alleviating T2D.

AB  - Microalbuminuria is considered the first clinical sign of kidney dysfunction and is associated with a poor renal and cardiovascular prognosis in type 2 diabetes. Detection of patients who are prone to develop micro- or macroalbuminuria may represent an effective strategy to start or optimise therapeutic intervention. Here we assessed the value of a urinary proteomic-based risk score (classifier) in predicting the development and progression of microalbuminuria.
   We conducted a prospective case-control study. Cases (n = 44) and controls (n = 44) were selected from the PREVEND (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease) study and from the Steno Diabetes Center (Gentofte, Denmark). Cases were defined by transition from normo- to microalbuminuria or from micro- to macroalbuminuria over a follow-up of 3 years. Controls with no transitions in albuminuria were pair-matched for age, sex and albuminuria status. A model for the progression of albuminuria was built using a proteomic classifier based on 273 urinary peptides.
   The proteomic classifier was independently associated with transition to micro- or macroalbuminuria (OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.02, 1.79], p = 0.035). The classifier predicted the development and progression of albuminuria on top of albuminuria and estimated GFR (eGFR, area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve increase of 0.03, p = 0.002; integrated discrimination index [IDI]: 0.105, p = 0.002). Fragments of collagen and alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein showed significantly different expression between cases and controls.
   Although limited by the relatively small sample size, these results suggest that analysis of a urinary biomarker set enables early renal risk assessment in patients with diabetes. Further work is required to confirm the role of urinary proteomics in the prevention of renal failure in diabetes.

AB  - The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is growing exponentially in Western countries, and the incidence of this condition is today increasing worldwide. Other than for cardiovascular complications, diabetes is particularly challenging for the kidney's health and proper function. Prolonged exposure of the kidneys to hyperglycemia in fact often results in a clinical complication called diabetic glomerulosclerosis, also known as diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy represents today the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in Western countries. When left untreated or undiagnosed, diabetic nephropathy is ultimately responsible for the need for dialysis and, in the worst cases, kidney transplantation of the affected individuals. The pathogenesis Of diabetic nephropathy has been studied extensively. A great number of metabolites, cytokines, proteins and transcription factors play a role in the accumulation of extracellular matrix and mesangial proliferation in the glomerulus; importantly, these phenotypic alterations are considered the 2 histological hallmarks of diabetic nephropathy. Additional effort is however required to understand the wide network of biochemical pathways that link diabetes to the renal damage in the long run. The integrative analysis of the proteomic and transcriptomic features of body fluids and/or bioptic samples among different categories of patients affected by diabetic nephropathy, if based on the accurate classification of the histopathological changes in the glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartment, could lead to the identification of new early biomarkers. This approach could represent an effective, noninvasive, alternative tool for early diagnosis and intervention.

AB  - The incidence of obesity and type diabetes 2 has increased dramatically resulting in an increased interest in its biomedical relevance. However, the mechanisms that trigger the development of diabetes type 2 in obese patients remain largely unknown. Scientific, clinical and pharmaceutical communities are dedicating vast resources to unravel this issue by applying different omics tools. During the last decade, the advances in proteomic approaches and the Human Proteome Organization have opened and are opening a new door that may be helpful in the identification of patients at risk and to improve current therapies. Here, we briefly review some of the advances in our understanding of type 2 diabetes that have occurred through the application of proteomics. We also review, in detail, the current improvements in proteomic methodologies and new strategies that could be employed to further advance our understanding of this pathology. By applying these new proteomic advances, novel therapeutic and/or diagnostic protein targets will be discovered in the obesity/Type 2 diabetes area.

AB  - Thrombus formation underpins the development of cardiovascular diseases, including acute coronary syndromes and ischaemic stroke. A number of well-characterised cardiovascular risk factors which contribute to the development of the majority of cardiovascular events have been identified, including dyslipidaemia, hypertension and diabetes. Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a 3- to 5-fold increased risk for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). They may have a cluster of haemostatic abnormalities, including elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and fibrinogen, which contribute to acute thrombotic events. It is clear that additional unidentified risk factors contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular events, and so the search for novel biomarkers and effectors, particularly in individuals with T2DM, remains a major challenge of cardiovascular medicine.
   Plasma and cellular proteins which contribute to thrombus formation have the potential to confer a pro-thrombotic state and represent a link between genotype, environment and disease phenotype. The comprehensive analysis of these proteins is now increasingly facilitated through the continued development of proteomic technologies which provide multifaceted approaches to the identification of novel biomarkers and/or effectors of thrombus formation and on which future anticoagulant and thrombolytic therapies may be based.
   This review provides an overview of current proteomic technologies. It focuses on the recent studies in which these technologies have been applied in the search for novel proteins that may confer increased risk of acute cardiovascular diseases and therefore that may influence disease progression and therapy.

While previous studies used antibody-based methods to quantify AGEs, data from tandem mass spectrometry coupled liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS)-based measurements are limited to patients with known diabetes. Here, we used the LC-MS/MSmethod to test the hypothesis that plasma AGE levels are higher in individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) than in those with normal fasting glucose (NFG). Secondary aims were to assess correlations of plasma AGEs with quantitative markers of glucose metabolism and biomarkers of subclinical inflammation. This study included on 60 women with NFG or IFG (n = 30 each, mean age 74 years) from the German SALIA cohort. Plasma levels of free metabolites (3-deoxyfructose, 3-deoxypentosone, 3-deoxypentulose), two hydroimidazolones, oxidised adducts (carboxymethyllysine, carboxyethyllysine, methionine sulfoxide) and Ne-fructosyllysine were measured using LC-MS/MS. Plasma concentrations of all tested AGEs did not differ between the NFG and IFG groups (all p>0.05). Associations between plasma levels of AGEs and fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR as a measure of insulin resistance were weak (r between -0.2 and 0.2, all p>0.05). The association between 3-deoxyglucosone-derived hydroimidazolone with several proinflammatory biomarkers disappeared upon adjustment for multiple testing. In conclusion, plasma AGEs assessed by LC-MS/MS were neither increased in IFG nor associated with parameters of glucosemetabolism and subclinical inflammation in our study. Thus, these data argue against strong effects of AGEs in the early stages of deterioration of glucosemetabolism.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids (AAAs) are associated with type 2 diabetes. However, repeated measurements of BCAA/AAA and their interactions with dietary interventions have not been evaluated. We investigated the associations between baseline and changes at 1 year in BCAA/AAA with type 2 diabetes in the context of a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) trial.
   Methods We included 251 participants with incident type 2 diabetes and a random sample of 694 participants (641 participants without type 2 diabetes and 53 overlapping cases) in a case-cohort study nested within the PREvencin con DIeta MEDiterranea (PREDIMED) trial. Participants were randomised to a MedDiet+extra-virgin olive oil (n = 273), a MedDiet+nuts (n = 324) or a control diet (n = 295). We used LC-MS/MS to measure plasma levels of amino acids. Type 2 diabetes was a pre-specified secondary outcome of the PREDIMED trial.
   Results Elevated plasma levels of individual BCAAs/AAAs were associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk after a median follow-up of 3.8 years: multivariable HR for the highest vs lowest quartile ranged from 1.32 for phenylalanine ([95% CI 0.90, 1.92], p for trend = 0.015) to 3.29 for leucine ([95% CI 2.03, 5.34], p for trend<0.001). Increases in BCAA score at 1 year were associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk in the control group with HR per SD = 1.61 (95% CI 1.02, 2.54), but not in the MedDiet groups (p for interaction <0.001). The MedDiet+extra-virgin olive oil significantly reduced BCAA levels after 1 year of intervention (p = 0.005 vs the control group).
   Conclusions/interpretation Our results support that higher baseline BCAAs and their increases at 1 year were associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk. A Mediterranean diet rich in extra-virgin olive oil significantly reduced the levels of BCAA and attenuated the positive association between plasma BCAA levels and type 2 diabetes incidence.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic multisystem disease. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of its significant microvascular complications, associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this article is to review the literature regarding the latest advances in the management of type 2 DM (T2DM) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We initially refer to the screening guidelines, the diagnostic tests used, the need for novel biomarkers in DN, the recent advances in high-risk patient identification, the recommended glycemic targets, and concerns regarding the accuracy of HbA1c in these patients. Then, a detailed explanation of the appropriate medical management based on evidence from recent trials is presented, analyzed, and discussed. All patients with T2DM should be screened for albuminuria at initial diagnosis and annually thereafter. Proteomics and metabolomics today represent promising diagnostic tools. Optimal glycemic control, with individualized HbA1c targets, is fundamental for reduced onset or delayed progression of DN and microvascular complications, in general. This can be enhanced by lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions when needed. Metformin represents the first pharmacological step, with, recently, a broadened indication for patients with impaired renal function. If HbA1c remains above the target in patients with established CKD, SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA are the preferred second-line agents, as introduced in all new guidelines. This change was the result of recent landmark trials that highlighted the superiority of the two aforementioned medication categories in terms of both renal and cardiovascular outcomes.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global public health issue characterized by excess weight, abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and a progressive increase in insulin resistance. Human population studies of T2D development and its effects on systemic metabolism are confounded by many factors that cannot be controlled, complicating the interpretation of results and the identification of early biomarkers. Aged, sedentary, and overweight/obese non-human primates (NHPs) are one of the best animal models to mimic spontaneous T2D development in humans. We sought to identify and distinguish a set of plasma and/or fecal metabolite biomarkers, that have earlier disease onset predictability, and that could be evaluated for their predictability in subsequent T2D studies in human cohorts. In this study, a single plasma and fecal sample was collected from each animal in a colony of 57 healthy and dysmetabolic NHPs and analyzed for metabolomics and lipidomics. The samples were comprehensively analyzed using untargeted and targeted LC/MS/MS. The changes in each animal's disease phenotype were monitored using IVGTT, HbA1c, and other clinical metrics, and correlated with their metabolic profile. The plasma and fecal lipids, as well as bile acid profiles, from Healthy, Dysmetabolic (Dys), and Diabetic (Dia) animals were compared. Following univariate and multivariate analyses, including adjustments for weight, age, and sex, several plasma lipid species were identified to be significantly different between these animal groups. Medium and long-chain plasma phosphatidylcholines (PCs) ranked highest at distinguishing Healthy from Dys animals, whereas plasma triglycerides (TG) primarily distinguished Dia from Dys animals. Random Forest (RF) analysis of fecal bile acids showed a reduction in the secondary bile acid glycoconjugate, GCDCA, in diseased animals (AUC 0.76[0.64, 0.89]). Moreover, metagenomics results revealed several bacterial species, belonging to the genera Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, and Streptococcus, to be both significantly enriched in non-healthy animals and associated with secondary bile acid levels. In summary, our results highlight the detection of several elevated circulating plasma PCs and microbial species associated with fecal secondary bile acids in NHP dysmetabolic states. The lipids and metabolites we have identified may help researchers to differentiate individual NHPs more precisely between dysmetabolic and overtly diabetic states. This could help assign animals to study groups that are more likely to respond to potential therapies where a difference in efficacy might be anticipated between early vs. advanced disease.

AB  - Glyoxal and methylglyoxal are oxoaldehydes derived from the degradation of glucose protein conjugates and from lipid peroxidation, and they are also present in the environment. This study investigated the site-specific reaction of glyoxal and methylglyoxal with the amino acid residues on human hemoglobin using a shot-gun proteomic approach with nanoflow liquid chromatography/nanospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS). In human hemoglobin incubated with glyoxal, modification on 8 different sites, including lysine residues at alpha-Lys-11, alpha-Lys-16, alpha-Lys-56, beta-Lys-17, beta-Lys-66, beta-Lys-144, and arginine residues at alpha-Arg-92 and beta-Arg-30, was observed using a data-dependent scan. In methylglyoxal-treated hemoglobin, there were specific residues, namely, alpha-Arg-92, beta-Lys-66, beta-Arg-30, and beta-Lys-144, forming carboxyethylation as well as the dehydrated product hydroimidazolone at alpha-Arg-92 and beta-Arg-30. These lysine and arginine modifications were confirmed by accurate mass measurement and the MS2 and MS' spectra. The most intensive signal of each modified peptide was used as the precursor ion to perform the product ion scan. The relative extent of modifications was semiquantified simultaneously relative to the native reference peptide by nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS under the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The extent of these modifications increased dose-dependently with increasing concentrations of glyoxal or methylglyoxal. Six out of the eight modifications induced by glyoxal and three out of the six modifications induced by methylglyoxal were detected in hemoglobin freshly isolated from human blood samples. The relative extent of modification of these post-translational modifications was quantified in poorly controlled type 2, diabetes mellitus patients (n = 20) and in nondiabetic control subjects (n = 21). The results show that the carboxymethylated peptides at alpha-Lys-16, alpha-Arg-92, beta-Lys-17, beta-Lys-66, and the peptide at alpha-Arg-92 with methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone are significantly higher in diabetic patients than in normal individuals (p value <0.05). This report identified and quantified glyoxal- and methylglyoxal-modified hemoglobin peptides in humans and revealed the association of the extent of modifications at specific sites with T2DM. Only one drop (10 mu L) of fresh blood is needed for this assay, and only an equivalent of 1 mu g of hemoglobin was analyzed by the nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS-SRM system. These results suggest the potential use of these specific post-translational modifications in hemoglobin as feasible biomarker candidates to assess protein damage induced by glyoxal and methylglyoxal.

AB  - Aims/hypothesisDiets with higher inflammatory and insulinaemic potential have been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, it remains unknown whether plasma metabolomic profiles related to proinflammatory/hyperinsulinaemic diets and to inflammatory/insulin biomarkers are associated with type 2 diabetes risk.MethodsWe analysed 6840 participants from the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study to identify the plasma metabolome related to empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP), empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH), four circulating inflammatory biomarkers and C-peptide. Dietary intakes were assessed using validated food frequency questionnaires. Plasma metabolomic profiling was conducted by LC-MS/MS. Metabolomic signatures were derived using elastic net regression. Multivariable Cox regression was used to examine associations of the metabolomic profiles with type 2 diabetes risk.ResultsWe identified 27 metabolites commonly associated with both EDIP and inflammatory biomarker z score and 21 commonly associated with both EDIH and C-peptide. Higher metabolomic dietary inflammatory potential (MDIP), reflecting higher metabolic potential of both an inflammatory dietary pattern and circulating inflammatory biomarkers, was associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk. The HR comparing highest vs lowest quartiles of MDIP was 3.26 (95% CI 2.39, 4.44). We observed a strong positive association with type 2 diabetes risk for the metabolomic signature associated with EDIP-only (HR 3.75; 95% CI 2.71, 5.17) or inflammatory biomarkers-only (HR 4.07; 95% CI 2.91, 5.69). In addition, higher metabolomic dietary index for hyperinsulinaemia (MDIH), reflecting higher metabolic potential of both an insulinaemic dietary pattern and circulating C-peptide, was associated with greater type 2 diabetes risk (HR 3.00; 95% CI 2.22, 4.06); further associations with type 2 diabetes were HR 2.79 (95% CI 2.07, 3.76) for EDIH-only signature and HR 3.89 (95% CI 2.82, 5.35) for C-peptide-only signature. The diet scores were significantly associated with risk, although adjustment for the corresponding metabolomic signature scores attenuated the associations with type 2 diabetes, these remained significant.Conclusions/interpretationThe metabolomic signatures reflecting proinflammatory or hyperinsulinaemic diets and related biomarkers were positively associated with type 2 diabetes risk, supporting that these dietary patterns may influence type 2 diabetes risk via the regulation of metabolism.

AB  - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder with systemic complications and has been a worldwide epidemic. Ophiopogon japonicus is a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat diabetes for thousands of years. From our previous work, we know that MDG-1, a water-soluble beta-D-fructan polysaccharide from O. japonicas could treat T2DM experimentally. However, MDG-1 is poorly absorbed and its mechanism of action is still unknown. Therefore, a GC TOF/MS-based metabonomic approach in combination with multivariate statistical analysis was performed to investigate the mechanism of MDG-1 in a spontaneous diabetic model. Female diabetic KKay mice (21 weeks old) were randomly divided into a diabetic group (n = 6, gavaged with distilled water) and a MDG-1-Diabetic group (n = 7, gavaged with MDG-1, 300 mg kg(-1)) and female C57BL/6 mice (21 weeks old) were set as controls (n = 6, gavaged with distilled water). After 8-weeks of treatment, feces samples were collected for GC-TOF/MS analysis. Consequently, 12 potential biomarkers were identified, including monosugars (D-tagatose, D-lyxose, D-erythrose, xylo-hexos-5-ulose, 2-deoxy-galactose), butanedioic acid, amino acids (phenylalanine, L-lysine, L-methionine, L-aspartic acid) and purine derivatives (7H-purine, 2'-deoxyinosine). We assume the monosugars and butanedioic acid were the fermentation products of MDG-1 by intestinal microbes and MDG-1 actions against diabetes might be accomplished through the absorbable monosugars and butanedioic acid via suppressing intestinal glucose absorption, enhancing liver glycogenesis, inhibiting glycogenolysis and promoting GLP-1 secretion. Besides, MDG-1 might alleviate diabetes and diabetic nephropathy by reducing 7H-purine and 2'-deoxyinosine. Further omics-driven studies including genomics, proteomics and metabonomics were considered to be carried out to provide direct evidence of gut microbiome contribution to MDG-1 actions.

AB  - Background and aims: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) refers to a cluster of clinically relevant factors that increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality. Circulating levels of several amino acids and metabolites related to one-carbon metabolism have been associated with cardiometabolic risk factors and MetS. We aimed to identify the amino acid profile that is significantly associated with MetS among an all male Mediterranean population.
   Methods and results: One hundred middle-aged men (54.6 +/- 8.9 years) participated in a cross-sectional study carried out during 2011-2012. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria were used to define MetS. Fasting plasma levels of 20 common amino acids and 15 metabolites related to amino acid and one-carbon metabolism were measured using gas chromatography (GC-MS/MS) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Principal components analysis was applied. Fifty-six participants fulfilled the IDF criteria for defining MetS. Five factors were extracted from the 35 measured metabolites. The branched-chain amino acids/aromatic amino acids (BCAA/AAA) related pattern and the glutamine/glycine/serine/asparagine (Gln/Gly/Ser/Asn) related pattern were significantly associated with MetS (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval; 6.41, 2.43-16.91, and 0.47, 0.23-0.96, respectively) after adjustment for age, current smoking status, physical activity level and medical treatment for hypertension, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus. Further adjustment for liver function markers (i.e. glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase, and g-glutamyltransferase), and plasma adiponectin levels did not significantly affect the associations.
   Conclusion: The BCAA/AAA pattern was positively associated, while the Gln/Gly/Ser/Asn pattern was inversely associated with established cardiometabolic risk factors and MetS. Plasma adiponectin levels or markers of liver function did not significantly affect these associations.

AB  - BackgroundThe growing epidemic of the inflammation-related metabolic disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, presents a challenge to improve our understanding of potential mechanisms or biomarkers to prevent or better control this age-associated disease. A gelsolin isoform is secreted into the plasma as part of the extracellular actin scavenger system which serves a protective role by digesting and removing actin filaments released from damaged cells. Recent data indicate a role for decreased plasma gelsolin (pGSN) levels as a biomarker of inflammatory conditions. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), a heterogeneous group of cell-derived membranous structures involved in intercellular signaling, have been implicated in metabolic and inflammatory diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus. We examined whether pGSN levels were associated with EV concentration and inflammatory plasma proteins in individuals with or without diabetes.MethodsWe quantified pGSN longitudinally (n = 104) in a socioeconomically diverse cohort of middle-aged African American and White study participants with and without diabetes mellitus. Plasma gelsolin levels were assayed by ELISA. EV concentration (sub-cohort n = 40) was measured using nanoparticle tracking analysis. Inflammatory plasma proteins were assayed on the SomaScan (R) v4 proteomic platform.ResultspGSN levels were lower in men than women. White individuals with diabetes had significantly lower levels of pGSN compared to White individuals without diabetes and to African American individuals either with or without diabetes. For adults living below poverty, those with diabetes had lower pGSN levels than those without diabetes. Adults living above poverty had similar pGSN levels regardless of diabetes status. No correlation between EV concentrations and pGSN levels was identified (r = - 0.03; p = 0.85). Large-scale exploratory plasma protein proteomics revealed 47 proteins that significantly differed by diabetes status, 19 of which significantly correlated with pGSN levels, including adiponectin.ConclusionsIn this cohort of racially diverse individuals with and without diabetes, we found differences in pGSN levels with diabetes status, sex, race, and poverty. We also report significant associations of pGSN with the adipokine, adiponectin, and other inflammation- and diabetes-related proteins. These data provide mechanistic insights into the relationship of pGSN and diabetes.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis It has been shown that melatonin plays a general beneficial role in type 2 diabetes in rodents but its role in humans is controversial. In the present study, we investigated the association between serum melatonin and type 2 diabetes risk in a southern Chinese population in a case-control study. We also examined the role of gut microbiota in this relationship.
   Methods Individuals with type 2 diabetes (cases) and healthy individuals (controls) (n=2034) were recruited from a cross-sectional study and were matched for age and sex in a case-control study. The levels of serum melatonin were measured and the association between serum melatonin and type 2 diabetes risk was examined using a multivariable logistic regression model. We further conducted a rigorously matched case-control study (n=120) in which gut microbial 16S rRNA was sequenced and metabolites were profiled using an untargeted LC-MS/MS approach.
   Results Higher levels of serum melatonin were significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (OR 0.82 [95% CI 0.74, 0.92]) and with lower levels of fasting glucose after adjustment for covariates (beta -0.25 [95% CI -0.38, -0.12]). Gut microbiota exhibited alteration in the individuals with type 2 diabetes, in whom lower levels of serum melatonin, lower alpha- and beta-diversity of gut microbiota (p<0.05), greater abundance of Bifidobacterium and lower abundance of Coprococcus (linear discriminant analysis [LDA] >2.0) were found. Seven genera were correlated with melatonin and type 2 diabetes-related traits; among them Bifidobacterium was positively correlated with serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IL-10, whereas Coprococcus was negatively correlated with serum IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-alpha and LPS (Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted p value [false discovery rate (FDR)] <0.05). Moreover, altered metabolites were detected in the participants with type 2 diabetes and there was a significant correlation between tryptophan (Trp) metabolites and the melatonin-correlated genera including Bifidobacterium and Coprococcus (FDR<0.05). Similarly, a significant correlation was found between Trp metabolites and inflammation factors, such as IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-alpha and LPS (FDR<0.05). Further, we showed that Trp metabolites may serve as a biomarker to predict type 2 diabetes status (AUC=0.804).
   Conclusions/interpretation A higher level of serum melatonin was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Gut microbiota-mediated melatonin signalling was involved in this association; especially, Bifidobacterium- and Coprococcus-mediated Trp metabolites may be involved in the process. These findings uncover the importance of melatonin and melatonin-related bacteria and metabolites as potential therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Intensive diabetes control has been associated with increased mortality in type 2 diabetes (T2DM); this has been suggested to be due to increased hypoglycemia. We measured hypoglycemia-induced changes in endothelial parameters, oxidative stress markers and inflammation at baseline and after a 24-hour period in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) subjects versus age-matched controls. Case-control study: 10 T2DM and 8 control subjects. Blood glucose was reduced from 5 (90 mg/dl) to hypoglycemic levels of 2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dl) for 1 hour by incremental hyperinsulinemic clamps using baseline and 24 hour samples. Measures of endothelial parameters, oxidative stress and inflammation at baseline and at 24-hours post hypoglycemia were performed: proteomic (Somalogic) analysis for inflammatory markers complemented by C-reactive protein (hsCRP) measurement, and proteomic markers and urinary isoprostanes for oxidative measures, together with endothelial function. Between baseline and 24 -hours after hypoglycemia, 15 of 140 inflammatory proteins differed in T2DM whilst only 1 of 140 differed in controls; all returned to baseline at 24-hours. However, elevated hsCRP levels were seen at 24-hours in T2DM (2.4 mg/L (1.2-5.4) vs. 3.9 mg/L (1.8-6.1), Baseline vs 24-hours, P < 0.05). In patients with T2DM, between baseline and 24-hour after hypoglycemia, only one of 15 oxidative stress proteins differed and this was not seen in controls. An increase (P = 0.016) from baseline (73.4 ng/mL) to 24 hours after hypoglycemia (91.7 ng/mL) was seen for urinary isoprostanes. Hypoglycemia resulted in inflammatory and oxidative stress markers being elevated in T2DM subjects but not controls 24-hours after the event.

AB  - We characterized the longitudinal serum protein signatures of women 6 and 10 years after having gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) to identify factors associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and prediabetes in this at-risk post-GDM population, aiming to discover potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and prevention of T2D. Our study identified 75 T2Dassociated serum proteins and 23 prediabetes-associated proteins, some of which were validated in an independent T2D cohort. Machine learning (ML) performed on the longitudinal proteomics highlighted protein signatures associated with progression to post-GDM diabetes. We also proposed prognostic biomarker candidates that were differentially regulated in healthy participants at 6 years postpartum who later progressed to having T2D. Our longitudinal study revealed T2D risk factors for post-GDM populations who are relatively young and healthy, providing insights for clinical decisions and early lifestyle interventions.

AB  - In this work, we review the main available computational methods of identifying biomarkers of complex diseases from high-throughput data. The emerging omics techniques provide powerful alternatives to measure thousands of molecules in cells in parallel manners. The generated genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and phenomic data provide comprehensive molecular and cellular information for detecting critical signals served as biomarkers by classifying disease phenotypic states. Networks are often employed to organize these profiles in the identification of biomarkers to deal with complex diseases in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy as well as mechanism deciphering from systematic perspectives. Here, we summarize some representative network-based bioinformatics methods in order to highlight the importance of computational strategies in biomarker discovery.

AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become the most frequent cause of chronic kidney disease worldwide due to the constant increase of the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in developed and developing countries. The understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of human diseases through a large-scale characterization of the protein content of a biological sample is the key feature of the proteomics approach to the study of human disease. We discuss the main results of over 10 years of tissue and urine proteomics studies applied to DN in order to understand how far we have come and how far we still have to go before obtaining a full comprehension of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of DN and identifying reliable biomarkers for accurate management of patients.

AB  - Recent advances in proteomic technologies have made high-throughput profiling of low-abundance proteins in large epidemiological cohorts increasingly feasible. We investigated whether aptamer-based proteomic profiling could identify biomarkers associated with future development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) beyond known risk factors. We identified dozens of markers with highly significant associations with future T2DM across 2 large longitudinal cohorts (n = 2839) followed for up to 16 years. We leveraged proteomic, metabolomic, genetic, and clinical data from humans to nominate 1 specific candidate to test for potential causal relationships in model systems. Our studies identified functional effects of aminoacylase 1 (ACY1), a top protein association with future T2DM risk, on amino acid metabolism and insulin homeostasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a loss-of-function variant associated with circulating levels of the biomarker WAP, Kazal, immunoglobulin, Kunitz, and NTR domain-containing protein 2 (WFIKKN2) was, in turn, associated with fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and HOMA-IR measurements in humans. In addition to identifying potentially novel disease markers and pathways in T2DM, we provide publicly available data to be leveraged for insights about gene function and disease pathogenesis in the context of human metabolism.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is one of the most important health issues around the world and a major risk factor for both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases. The etiology of MetS is determined by the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Effective prevention and treatment of MetS notably decreases the risk of its complications such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. According to recent genome-wide association studies, multiple genes are involved in the incidence and development of MetS. The presence of particular genes which are responsible for obesity and lipid metabolism, affecting insulin sensitivity and blood pressure, as well as genes associated with inflammation, can increase the risk of MetS. These molecular markers, together with clinical data and findings from proteomic, metabolomic, pharmacokinetic, and other methods, would clarify the etiology and pathophysiology of MetS and facilitate the development of personalized approaches to the management of MetS. The application of personalized medicinebased on susceptibility identified genomes would help physicians recommend healthier lifestyles and prescribe medications to improve various aspects of health in patients with MetS. In recent years, personalized medicine by genetic testing has helped physicians determine genetic predisposition to MetS, prevent the disease by behavioral, lifestyle-related, or therapeutic interventions, and detect, diagnose, treat, and manage the disease. Clinically, personalized medicine is providing effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of MetS by reducing the time, cost, and failure rate of pharmaceutical clinical trials. It is also eliminating trial-and-error inefficiencies that inflate health care costs and undermine patient care.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus in general and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) in particular, are very complex diseases with heterogeneous etiology. T2D results from the impaired secretion or action of the insulin with a clinical phenotype of persistent hyperglycemia in the uncontrolled subjects. The disease clinical features appear after several years of latent preclinical asymptomatic conditions. Thus, when the disease is full blown, there are limited chances to reverse the disease phenotype; however, it can be managed by controlling diet, changing life style and using medicines. Understanding pathological mechanisms whereby genetic and/or environmental factors contribute to the development of diabetes is important for the prevention and treatment of the disease. In this regard, approaches such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics are being applied to identify more specific biomarkers for T2D for its early detection, management and devising new therapies. The emphasis of the present review is to provide updates on the applications of proteomics in addressing T2D with a focus on protein based biomarker discovery. Moreover, the idea of personalized medicine and intervention is also discussed for diabetes treatment in proteomics perspective.

AB  - Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially life-threatening disease that is common in the aging population. Currently, there are no approved diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic drugs for AAA. We aimed to identify novel plasma biomarkers or potential therapeutic targets for AAA using a high-throughput protein array-based method. Proteomics expression profiles were investigated in plasma from AAA patients and healthy controls (HC) using 440-cytokine protein array analysis. Several promising biomarkers were further validated in independent cohorts using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Thirty-nine differentially expressed plasma proteins were identified between AAA and HC. Legumain (LGMN) was significantly higher in AAA patients and was validated in another large cohort. Additionally, "AAA without diabetes" (AAN) patients and "AAA complicated with type 2 diabetes mellitus" (AAM) patients had different cytokine expression patterns in their plasma, and nine plasma proteins were differentially expressed among the AAN, AAM, and HC subjects. Delta-like protein 1 (DLL1), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3 (ERBB3), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPPIV) were significantly higher in AAM than in AAN. This study identified several promising plasma biomarkers of AAA. Their role as therapeutic targets for AAA warrants further investigation.

AB  - The persistent increase in the worldwide burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and the accompanying rise of its complications, including cardiovascular disease, necessitates our understanding of the metabolic disturbances that cause diabetes mellitus. Metabolomics and proteomics, facilitated by recent advances in high-throughput technologies, have given us unprecedented insight into circulating biomarkers of T2D even over a decade before overt disease. These markers may be effective tools for diabetes mellitus screening, diagnosis, and prognosis. As participants of metabolic pathways, metabolite and protein markers may also highlight pathways involved in T2D development. The integration of metabolomics and proteomics with genomics in multiomics strategies provides an analytical method that can begin to decipher causal associations. These methods are not without their limitations; however, with careful study design and sample handling, these methods represent powerful scientific tools that can be leveraged for the study of T2D. In this article, we aim to give a timely overview of circulating metabolomics and proteomics findings with T2D observed in large human population studies to provide the reader with a snapshot into these emerging fields of research.

AB  - Aims Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common and severe complication to type 2 diabetes. The pathogenesis of DPN is not fully known, but several pathways and gene polymorphisms contributing to DPN are described. DPN can be studied using nerve biopsies, but studies on the proteome of the nerve itself, and its surrounding tissue as a whole, are lacking. Studies on the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) have proposed PIN a useful indicator of DPN. Methods A quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis was made of peripheral nerves from age- and gender-matched living human male tissue donors; nine type 2 diabetes subjects, with decreased sural nerve action potentials indicating DPN, and six controls without type 2 diabetes, with normal electrophysiology results. Results A total of 2617 proteins were identified. Linear regression was used to discover which proteins were differentially expressed between type 2 diabetes and controls. Only soft signals were found. Therefore, clustering of the 500 most variable proteins was made to find clusters of similar proteins in type 2 diabetes subjects and healthy controls. Conclusions This feasibility study shows, for the first time, that the use of quantitative mass spectrometry enables quantification of proteins from nerve biopsies from subjects with and without type 2 diabetes, which may aid in finding biomarkers of importance to DPN development.

AB  - Very low calorie diets (VLCD) with and without exercise programs lead to major metabolic improvements in obese type 2 diabetes patients. The mechanisms underlying these improvements have so far not been elucidated fully. To further investigate the mechanisms of a VLCD with or without exercise and to uncover possible biomarkers associated with these interventions, blood samples were collected from 27 obese type 2 diabetes patients before and after a 16-week VLCD (Modifast,450 kcal/day). Thirteen of these patients followed an exercise program in addition to the VCLD. Plasma was obtained from 27 lean and 27 obese controls as well. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry (MS) and targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and a large scale isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) approach. After the 16-week VLCD, there was a significant decrease in body weight and HbA1c in all patients, without differences between the two intervention groups. Targeted MRM analysis revealed differences in several proteins, which could be divided in diabetes-associated (fibrinogen, transthyretin), obesity-associated (complement C3), and diet-associated markers (apolipoproteins, especially apolipoprotein A-IV). To further investigate the effects of exercise, large scale iTRAQ analysis was performed. However, no proteins were found showing an exercise effect. Thus, in this study, specific proteins were found to be differentially expressed in type 2 diabetes patients versus controls and before and after a VLCD. These proteins are potential disease state and intervention specific biomarkers.

AB  - Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) by 2-4 fold, and is associated with endothelial dysfunction, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, and chronic hyperglycaemia. The aim of this investigation was to assess, by a multimarker mass spectrometry approach, the predictive role of circulating proteins as biomarkers of cardiovascular damage progression associated with diabetes mellitus.Methods The study considered 34 patients with both T2DM and CHD, 31 patients with T2DM and without CHD, and 30 patients without diabetes with a diagnosis of CHD. Plasma samples of subjects were analysed through a multiplexed targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based assay, namely Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM), allowing the simultaneous detection of peptides derived from a protein of interest. Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis was employed to identify enriched GO terms in the biological process, molecular function, or cellular component categories. Non-parametric multivariate methods were used to classify samples from patients and evaluate the relevance of the analysed proteins' panel.Results A total of 81 proteins were successfully quantified in the human plasma samples. Gene Ontology analysis assessed terms related to blood microparticles, extracellular exosomes and collagen-containing extracellular matrix. Preliminary evaluation using analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the differences in the proteomic profile among patient groups identified 13 out of the 81 proteins as significantly different. Multivariate analysis, including cluster analysis and principal component analysis, identified relevant grouping of the 13 proteins. The first main cluster comprises apolipoprotein C-III, apolipoprotein C-II, apolipoprotein A-IV, retinol-binding protein 4, lysozyme C and cystatin-C; the second one includes, albeit with sub-grouping, alpha 2 macroglobulin, afamin, kininogen 1, vitronectin, vitamin K-dependent protein S, complement factor B and mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves obtained with the 13 selected proteins using a nominal logistic regression indicated a significant overall distinction (p < 0.001) among the three groups of subjects, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) ranging 0.91-0.97, and sensitivity and specificity ranging from 85 to 100%.Conclusions Targeted mass spectrometry approach indicated 13 multiple circulating proteins as possible biomarkers of cardiovascular damage progression associated with T2DM, with excellent classification results in terms of sensitivity and specificity.

AB  - Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are the most prevalent and serious metabolic diseases affecting people worldwide. However racial and ethnic disparities seems to be a risk factor for their development. Mexico has been named as one of the largest populations with the highest prevalence of diabetes and obesity. The aim of this study was to identify novel T2D-associated proteins in Mexican patients. Blood samples were collected from 62 Mexican patients with T2D and they were grouped according to their body mass index (BMI). A panel of 10 diabetes and obesity serum markers was determined using MAGPIX. A comparative proteomics study was performed using two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) followed by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We detected 113 spots differentially accumulated, in which 64 unique proteins were identified, proteins that were involved in metabolism pathways, molecular transport, and cellular signalling. Four proteins (14-3-3, ApoH, ZAG, and OTO3) showing diabetes-related variation and also changes in relation to obesity were selected for further validation by western blotting. Our results reveal new diabetes related proteins present in the Mexican population. These could provide additional insight into the understanding of diabetes development in Mexican population and may also be useful candidate biomarkers.

AB  - Clinical risk factors explain only a fraction of the variability of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline in people with type 2 diabetes. Cross-omics technologies by virtue of a wide spectrum screening of plasma samples have the potential to identify biomarkers for the refinement of prognosis in addition to clinical variables. Here we utilized proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics panel assay measurements in baseline plasma samples from the multinational PROVALID study (PROspective cohort study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for VALIDation of biomarkers) of patients with incident or early chronic kidney disease (median follow-up 35 months, median baseline eGFR 84 mL/min/1.73 m(2), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 8.1 mg/g). In an accelerated case-control study, 258 individuals with a stable eGFR course (median eGFR change 0.1 mL/min/year) were compared to 223 individuals with a rapid eGFR decline (median eGFR decline -6.75 mL/min/year) using Bayesian multivariable logistic regression models to assess the discrimination of eGFR trajectories. The analysis included 402 candidate predictors and showed two protein markers (KIM-1, NTproBNP) to be relevant predictors of the eGFR trajectory with baseline eGFR being an important clinical covariate. The inclusion of metabolomic and lipidomic platforms did not improve discrimination substantially. Predictions using all available variables were statistically indistinguishable from predictions using only KIM-1 and baseline eGFR (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.63). Thus, the discrimination of eGFR trajectories in patients with incident or early diabetic kidney disease and maintained baseline eGFR was modest and the protein marker KIM-1 was the most important predictor.

AB  - Abdominal or visceral obesity is a well-known risk factor for metabolic diseases. However, whether abdominal obesity significantly affects plasma lipid profile during the development of type 2 diabetes has not been fully elucidated. We investigated the differences in plasma lipid concentrations in 63 participants categorized into six groups (middle-aged Korean men); Normal, Pre-diabetes (pre-DM), and Diabetes mellitus (DM) with or without abdominal obesity (AO or lean). The lipidomic profiles were determined by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sphingomyelin (SM) levels in plasma were significantly higher in the pre-DM with AO than in pre-DM with lean (p = 0.021). SM concentrations correlated positively with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (r = 0.256, p = 0.044), cholesteryl ester (CE) (r = 0.483, p < 0.0001), ceramide (r = 0.489, p < 0.0001) and plasmanyl phosphatidylcholine (PC) (r = 0.446, p < 0.0001). The present study found that pre-diabetic patients with AO were characterized by increased plasma concentrations of SM. Plasma SM levels in individuals with AO may be an early prognostic biomarker to better predict the progression toward type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

AB  - Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed upon nonenzymatic reactions of sugars or their metabolites with proteins and other cellular constituents. Many AGEs are long lived. Recent findings suggest that AGEs may predict diabetes and its complications and thus may warrant further study. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of our experimental procedures for measuring AGEs in stored blood sample and to conduct a pilot study for developing AGE biomarkers for diabetes and/or age-related changes of glucose metabolism. We conducted a reliability study of the samples and methods using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS assays for 10 AGEs (including methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone (MG-H1), glucosepane (GSP) and two oxidation measures, in stored repository blood samples from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We also analyzed data relating blood GSP levels to type 2 diabetes status in a case-control study (25 cases and 15 controls). Among the AGEs, GSP, and MG-H1 showed the highest reliability across the various measures: reliability in duplicate samples and stability with delayed processing and storage over 1-2 year period. Furthermore, plasma GSP was associated with older age (P=0.04) and type 2 diabetes status (age-adjusted P=0.0475). Our findings suggest that analysis of these AGEs may be developed as biomarkers for diabetes and/or age-related changes of glucose metabolism. (c) 2018 BioFactors, 44(3):281-288, 2018

AB  - The incidence of type 2 diabetes is increasing more rapidly in adolescents than in any other age group. We identified and compared metabolite signatures in obese children with type 2 diabetes (T2D), obese children without diabetes (OB), and healthy, age- and gender-matched normal weight controls (NW) by measuring 273 analytes in fasting plasma and 24-hour urine samples from 90 subjects by targeted LC-MS/MS. Diabetic subjects were within 2 years of diagnosis in an attempt to capture early-stage disease prior to declining renal function. We found 22 urine metabolites that were uniquely associated with T2D when compared to OB and NW groups. The metabolites most significantly elevated in T2D youth included members of the betaine pathway, nucleic acid metabolism, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and their catabolites. Notably, the metabolite pattern in OB and T2D groups differed between urine and plasma, suggesting that urinary BCAAs and their intermediates behaved as a more specific biomarker for T2D, while plasma BCAAs associated with the obese, insulin resistant state independent of diabetes status. Correlative analysis of metabolites in the T2D signature indicated that betaine metabolites, BCAAs, and aromatic amino acids were associated with hyperglycemia, but BCAA acylglycine derivatives and nucleic acid metabolites were linked to insulin resistance. Of major interest, we found that urine levels of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICA-riboside) were increased in diabetic youth, identifying urine SAICA-riboside as a potential biomarker for T2D.

AB  - Background: As one of the major complications of diabetes, cardiovascular disease might result in early death in people with diabetes. miR-126 and 210 expressions undergo alterations in cardiac disease and cause heart failure.
   Methods: Animals were divided into the 5 groups of control (Con), diabetes (Dia), diabeticcrocin (Dia-Cro), diabetic-voluntary exercise (Dia-Exe), and diabetic-crocin-voluntary exercise (Dia-Cro-Exe). Type 2 diabetes was induced by the use of a high-fat diet (4 weeks) and injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (i.p, 35 mg/kg). Animals received crocin orally (50 mg/kg), and voluntary exercise was performed alone or together for 8 weeks. QRT-PCR method was used to determine the levels of miR-210 and miR-126 in cardiac tissue.
   Results: The levels of miR-210 and miR-126 in the cardiac tissue augmented in both the crocin and voluntary exercise groups in comparison with the non-treated group (p<0.001). The use of combination therapy with exercise and crocin magnified their effects on miR-210 and miR-126 levels (p<0.001). Moreover, MiR-210 levels were lower in the crocin group compared to the exercise group (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: The results indicated that voluntary exercise combined with crocin might provide a novel therapeutic plan for cardiovascular disease through increasing miR-210 and miR-126 expression.

AB  - In the present research work, the levels of protein biomarkers specific to diabetes mellitus type 2 in the Pakistani population using proteomic technology have been identified and characterized and effect of high dose thiamine has been seen on the levels of these marker proteins. Diabetic patients and normal healthy controls were recruited from the Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Total biochemical assays and proteins were estimated by modern proteomic techniques. Some proteins were up- and downregulated in diabetic samples as compared to control and decreased after thiamine therapy, while other protein markers did not show a significant change after the thiamine therapy. The effect of high dose thiamine on the levels of these identified protein biomarkers in the human urine has also been observed. Assessment of the levels of these biomarkers will be helpful in not only early diagnosis but also prognosis of diabetes mellitus type 2.

Fluorescence difference in-gel electrophoresis was performed to determine potential differences in the global protein expression profile of muscle extracts. Besides changes in contractile proteins and metabolic enzymes, the abundance of the small stress proteins alpha B-crystallin and Hsp27 was significantly increased. The up-regulation of the low-molecular-mass heat shock protein Hsp27 was confirmed by an alternative fluorescent staining method of two-dimensional gels and immunoblotting. The observed protein alterations in the cellular stress response, distinct metabolic pathways, regulatory mechanisms and the contractile apparatus might be directly or indirectly associated with peripheral resistance to insulin signalling, making these newly identified muscle proteins potential biomarkers of type-2 diabetes. Increased levels of molecular chaperones suggest considerably enhanced cellular stress levels in diabetic muscle fibres.

AB  - Liver enzyme concentrations are measured as safety end points in clinical trials to detect drug-related hepatotoxicity, but little is known about the epidemiology of these biomarkers in subjects without hepatic dysfunction who are enrolled in drug trials. We studied alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST) in subjects randomized to placebo who completed assessments over 36 mo in a cardiovascular outcome trial [the Stabilisation of Atherosclerotic Plaque by Initiation of Darapladib Therapy ("STABILITY") trial; n = 4,264; mean age: 64.2 yr] or over 12 mo in three trials that enrolled only subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) [the DIA trials; n = 308; mean age: 62.4 yr] to investigate time-dependent relationships and the factors that might affect ALT and AST, including body mass index (BMI), T2D, and renal function. Multivariate linear mixed models examined time-dependent relationships between liver enzyme concentrations as response variables and BMI, baseline T2D status, hemoglobin A(1c) levels, and renal function, as explanatory variables. At baseline, ALT was higher in individuals who were men, <65 yr old, and obese and who had glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >60 ml.min(-1).1.73 m(-2). ALT was not significantly associated with T2D at baseline, although it was positively associated with HbA(1c). GFR had a greater impact on ALT than T2D. ALT concentrations decreased over time in subjects who lost weight but remained stable in individuals with increasing BMI. Weight change did not alter AST concentrations. We provide new insights on the influence of time, GFR, and HbA(1c) on ALT and AST concentrations and confirm the effect of sex, age, T2D, BMI, and BMI change in subjects receiving placebo in clinical trials.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Clinical trials provide high-quality data on liver enzyme concentrations from subjects randomized to placebo that can be used to investigate the epidemiology of these biomarkers. The adjusted models show the influence of sex, age, time, renal function, type 2 diabetes, HbA(1c), and body mass index on alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations and their relative importance. These factors need to be considered when assessing potential signals of hepatotoxicity in trials of new drugs and in clinical trials investigating subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are increasing worldwide. This is mainly due to an unhealthy nutrition, implying that variation in CVD risk may be due to variation in the capacity to manage a nutritional load. We examined the genomic basis of postprandial metabolism. Our main purpose was to introduce the GEMM Family Study (Genetics of Metabolic Diseases in Mexico) as a multi-center study carrying out an ongoing recruitment of healthy urban adults. Each participant received a mixed meal challenge and provided a 5-hours' time course series of blood, buffy coat specimens for DNA isolation, and adipose tissue (ADT)/skeletal muscle (SKM) biopsies at fasting and 3 h after the meal. A comprehensive profiling, including metabolomic signatures in blood and transcriptomic and proteomic profiling in SKM and ADT, was performed to describe tendencies for variation in postprandial response. Our data generation methods showed preliminary trends indicating that by characterizing the dynamic properties of biomarkers with metabolic activity and analyzing multi-OMICS data it could be possible, with this methodology and research design, to identify early trends for molecular biology systems and genes involved in the fasted and fed states.

AB  - The recent advancements in clinical proteomics enabled identification of biomarker panels for a large range of diseases. A number of CE-MS-identified biomarker panels were verified and implemented in clinical studies. Despite multiple challenges, accumulating evidence supports the value and the need for proteome-based biomarker panels. In this perspective, we provide an overview of clinical studies indicating the added value of CE-MS biomarker panels over traditional diagnostics and monitoring methods. We outline apparent advantages of applying novel proteomic biomarker panels for disease diagnosis, prognosis, staging, drug development and patient management. Facing the plethora of benefits associated with the use of CEMS biomarker panels, we envision their implementation into the medical practice in the near future.

AB  - Background: There are big differences in treatments and prognosis between diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD). However, DKD patients couldn't be diagnosed early due to lack of special biomarkers. Urine is an ideal non-invasive sample for screening DKD biomarkers. This study aims to explore DKD special biomarkers by urinary proteomics. Materials and Methods: According to the result of renal biopsy, 142 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients were divided into 2 groups: DKD (n = 83) and NDRD (n = 59). Ten patients were selected from each group to define urinary protein profiles by label-free quantitative proteomics. The candidate proteins were further verifyied by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) methods (n = 40). Proteins which perform the same trend both in PRM and proteomics were verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) with expanding the sample size (n = 82). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic biomarkers. Results: We identified 417 peptides in urinary proteins showing significant difference between DKD and NDRD. PRM verification identified C7, SERPINA4, IGHG1, SEMG2, PGLS, GGT1, CDH2, CDH1 was consistent with the proteomic results and p < 0.05. Three potential biomarkers for DKD, C7, SERPINA4, and gGT1, were verified by ELISA. The combinatied SERPINA4/Ucr and gGT1/Ucr (AUC = 0.758, p = 0.001) displayed higher diagnostic efficiency than C7/Ucr (AUC = 0.632, p = 0.048), SERPINA4/Ucr (AUC = 0.661, p = 0.032), and gGT1/Ucr (AUC = 0.661, p = 0.029) respectively. Conclusions: The combined index SERPINA4/Ucr and gGT1/Ucr can be considered as candidate biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy after adjusting by urine creatinine.

AB  - We aimed to discover novel associations between leptin and circulating proteins which could link leptin to the development of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In a discovery phase, we investigated associations between 88 plasma proteins, assessed with a proximity extension assay, and plasma leptin in a cohort of middle-aged patients with T2DM. Associations passing the significance threshold of a False discovery rate of 5% (corresponding to p<0.0017) were replicated in patients with T2DM in an independent cohort. We also investigated if proteins mediated the longitudinal association between plasma leptin and the incidence of major cardiovascular events (MACE). One protein, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP), was significantly associated with leptin in both the discovery phase [95% CI (0.06, 0.17) p=0.00002] and the replication cohort [95% CI (0.12, 0.39) p=0.0003]. Multiplicative interaction analyses in the two cohorts suggest a stronger association between A-FABP and leptin in men than in women. In longitudinal analyses, the association between leptin and MACE was slightly attenuated after adding A-FABP to the multivariate model. Our analysis identified a consistent association between leptin and A-FABP in two independent cohorts of patients with T2DM, particularly in men.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT 01049737.

AB  - PurposeRobust, affordable plasma proteomic biomarker workflows are needed for large-scale clinical studies. We evaluated aspects of sample preparation to allow liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of more than 1500 samples from the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial of adults with type 2 diabetes. MethodsUsing LC-MS with data-independent acquisition we evaluated four variables: plasma protein depletion, EDTA or citrated anti-coagulant blood collection tubes, plasma lipid depletion strategies and plasma freeze-thaw cycles. Optimised methods were applied in a pilot study of FIELD participants. ResultsLC-MS of undepleted plasma conducted over a 45 min gradient yielded 172 proteins after excluding immunoglobulin isoforms. Cibachrome-blue-based depletion yielded additional proteins but with cost and time expenses, while immunodepleting albumin and IgG provided few additional identifications. Only minor variations were associated with blood collection tube type, delipidation methods and freeze-thaw cycles. From 65 batches involving over 1500 injections, the median intra-batch quantitative differences in the top 100 proteins of the plasma external standard were less than 2%. Fenofibrate altered seven plasma proteins. Conclusions and clinical relevanceA robust plasma handling and LC-MS proteomics workflow for abundant plasma proteins has been developed for large-scale biomarker studies that balance proteomic depth with time and resource costs.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis Increased levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. However, most metabolomic studies are limited to an analysis of plasma metabolites under fasting conditions, rather than the dynamic shift in response to a metabolic challenge. Moreover, metabolomic profiles of peripheral tissues involved in glucose homeostasis are scarce and the transcriptomic regulation of genes involved in BCAA catabolismis partially unknown. This study aimed to identify differences in circulating and skeletal muscle BCAA levels in response to an OGTT in individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) or type 2 diabetes. Additionally, transcription factors involved in the regulation of the BCAA gene set were identified.
   Methods Plasma and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained from individuals with NGT or type 2 diabetes before and after an OGTT. Plasma and quadricepsmuscles were harvested fromskeletalmuscle-specific Ppargc1a knockout and transgenic mice. BCAA-related metabolites and genes were assessed by LC-MS/MS and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Small interfering RNA and adenovirus-mediated overexpression techniques were used in primary human skeletal muscle cells to study the role of PPARGC1A and ESRRA in the expression of the BCAA gene set. Radiolabelled leucine was used to analyse the impact of oestrogen-related receptor alpha (ERR alpha) knockdown on leucine oxidation.
   Results Impairments in BCAA catabolism in people with type 2 diabetes under fasting conditions were exacerbated after a glucose load. Branched-chain keto acids were reduced 37-56% after an OGTT in the NGT group, whereas no changes were detected in individuals with type 2 diabetes. These changes were concomitant with a stronger correlation with glucose homeostasis biomarkers and downregulated expression of branched-chain amino acid transaminase 2, branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex subunits and 69% of downstream BCAA-related genes in skeletal muscle. In primary human myotubes overexpressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha, encoded by PPARGC1A), 61% of the analysed BCAA genes were upregulated, while 67% were downregulated in the quadriceps of skeletalmuscle-specific Ppargc1a knockout mice. ESRRA (encoding ERR alpha) silencing completely abrogated the PGC-1 alpha-induced upregulation of BCAA-related genes in primary human myotubes.
   Conclusions/interpretation Metabolic inflexibility in type 2 diabetes impacts BCAA homeostasis and attenuates the decrease in circulating and skeletal muscle BCAA-related metabolites after a glucose challenge. Transcriptional regulation of BCAA genes in primary human myotubes via PGC-1 alpha is ERR alpha-dependent.

AB  - Background: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a leading risk factor for end-stage renal disease and is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. It is possible that novel markers portraying the pathophysiological underpinning processes may be useful. Aim: To investigate the associations between 80 circulating proteins, measured by a proximity extension assay, and prevalent DKD and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in type 2 diabetes. Methods: We randomly divided individuals with type 2 diabetes from three cohorts into a two-thirds discovery and one-third replication set (total n = 813, of whom 231 had DKD defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mg/mL/1.73 m(2) and/or urinary albumin-creatinine ratio >= 3 g/mol). Proteins associated with DKD were also assessed as predictors for incident major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in persons with DKD at baseline. Results: Four proteins were positively associated with DKD in models adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, glucose control, and diabetes medication: kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1, odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation increment, 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-2.14); growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15, OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.16-1.69); myoglobin (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.30-1.91), and matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP-10, OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.17-1.74). In patients with DKD, GDF-15 was significantly associated with increased risk of MACE after adjustments for baseline age, sex, microalbuminuria, and kidney function and (59 MACE events during 7 years follow-up, hazard ratio per standard deviation increase 1.43 [95% CI 1.03-1.98]) but not after further adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusion: Our proteomics approach confirms and extends previous associations of higher circulating levels of GDF-15 with both micro- and macrovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our data encourage additional studies evaluating the clinical utility of our findings.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that the accumulation of atypical, 1-deoxysphingolipids that lack the C1 hydroxyl group may be associated with diabetic neuropathy (DN). We hypothesized that specific plasma 1-deoxysphingolipids associate with DN severity, and that alterations in plasma serine and alanine associate with 1-deoxysphingolipid elevation in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We examined individual 1-deoxysphingolipid species using LC/ MS/MS in plasma samples from 75 individuals including lean controls (LC, n = 19), those with obesity (n = 19), obesity with T2D without DN (ob/T2D, n = 18), and obesity with T2D with DN (Ob/T2D/DN, n = 19). We ob-served a step wise increase in 1-deoxydihydroceramides across these four groups (spearman correlation coeffi-cient r = 0.41, p = 0.0002). Mean total concentrations of 1-deoxydihydroceramides, and most individual 1-deoxydihydroceramide species, were higher in ob/T2D/DN versus LC group (8.939 vs. 5.195 pmol/100 mu L for total 1-deoxydihydroceramides p = 0.005). No significant differences in 1-deoxydihydroceramides were ob-served between the ob/T2D and ob/T2D/DN groups. L-alanine was higher and L-serine lower in ob/T2D/DN ver-sus LC groups (326.2 vs. 248.0 mu M, p = 0.0086 and 70.2 vs. 89.8 mu M, p = 0.0110), consistent with a potential contribution of these changes to the observed 1-deoxysphingolipids profiles. 1-deoxydihydroceramides corre-lated inversely with leg intraepidermal nerve fiber density (CC-0.40, p = 0.003). These findings indicate that 1-deoxydihydroceramides may be important biomarkers and/or mediators of DN. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aimed to obtain information on bile acid profiles in diabetic (db/dh) mice and their wild type (wt) littermates for the understanding of pathogenesis and discovery of potential biomarkers of type 2 diabetes. Analytical methods based on protein precipitation or solid-phase extraction together with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were developed for the determination of 25 bile adds in plasma, urine and feces samples collected from db/db and wt mice. GLP-1 concentration and hepatic genes related to bile acid synthesis were also investigated. The results showed that the concentrations of individual bile adds varied notably both interindividually and temporally. However, plasma, urine and feces samples displayed discriminating bile acid profiles between the db/db and wt groups, with the plasma profile showing the best differentiation capacity. In plasma and urine, the concentration variation of taurine-conjugated bile adds was more correlated with that of other taurine-conjugated bile acids, and vice versa for the unconjugated bile acids. Transcription of hepatic gene Cyp7b1 was downregulated, and Hsd3b7 upregulated in db/db mice. In conclusion, the bile add profile, particularly that in plasma, can distinguish the two animal groups and is a promising biomarker for type 2 diabetes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neck and low back pain are common among the adult human population and impose large social and economic burdens on health care and quality of life. Spine-related disorders are also significant health concerns for canine companions with etiopathogeneses, clinical presentations, and diagnostic and therapeutic options that are very similar to their human counterparts. Historically, induced and spontaneous pathology in laboratory rodents, dogs, sheep, goats, pigs, and nonhuman primates have been used for study of human spine disorders. While each of these can serve as useful preclinical models, they all have inherent limitations. Spontaneously occurring spine disorders in dogs provide highly translatable data that overcome many of the limitations of other models and have the added benefit of contributing to veterinary healthcare as well. For this scoping review, peer-reviewed manuscripts were selected from PubMed and Google Scholar searches using keywords: "intervertebral disc," "intervertebral disc degeneration," "biomarkers," "histopathology," "canine," and "mechanism." Additional keywords such as "injury," "induced model," and "nucleus degeneration" were used to further narrow inclusion. The objectives of this review were to (a) outline similarities in key features of spine disorders between dogs and humans; (b) describe relevant canine models; and (c) highlight the applicability of these models for advancing translational research and clinical application for mechanisms of disease, diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and treatment, with a focus on intervertebral disc degeneration. Best current evidence suggests that dogs share important anatomical, physiological, histological, and molecular components of spinal disorders in humans, such that induced and spontaneous canine models can be very effective for translational research. Taken together, the peer-reviewed literature supports numerous advantages for use of canine models for study of disorders of the spine when the potential limitations and challenges are addressed.

AB  - The proteomics is known to be a valuable field of study and has become one of the most attractive sub-disciplines in clinical proteomics for human diseases. In the present research work, the levels of urinary protein biomarkers of diabetes mellitus type 2 using proteomic technology have been identified and characterized. Effect of high dose thiamine has also been observed on the levels of these marker proteins. Above 100 type 2 diabetic patients, and 50 same age and sex-matched normal healthy controls were recruited from the Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan and 40 diabetic and 20 control have completed the trial. The urine samples from control and diabetic groups before or after thiamine therapy were further analyzed and identified by 2-D liquid chromatographic system (HPLC) and mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF/TOF and microTOF analysis. All the samples belonging to the control and diabetic groups were then analyzed by ELISA and estimated the levels of some proteins which were found to vary. In the urine samples, the levels of transthyretin, AMBP, haptoglobin precursor were found to decrease while albumin, zinc a 2 glycoprotein, RBP4 and E cadherin were found to increase in the diabetic patients as compared to the controls. The level of albumin in the urine samples of diabetic patients only decreased by 34% after thiamine therapy as compared to the controls and the placebo, while other urinary protein markers did not show a significant change after the therapy. Assessment of the levels of these biomarkers will be helpful in the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Lower extremity artery disease (LEAD) is greatly harmful to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an alternative therapy to delay the development of macrovascular diseases, but the existing evidence of its efficacy, safety and mechanism of action is insufficient. We report a study protocol of a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that aims to use well-designed clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) Shen-Qi Hua-Yu formula, and to explore efficacy mechanism of the TCM granules and the biomarkers of TCM syndrome. Methods: This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled study that randomized 120 participants into 2 groups. The treatment group will receive TCM granules and conventional medicine, while the control group will receive placebo in addition to conventional medicine. Two groups will receive 12-week treatment and 48-week follow-up, with a total of 13 visits. Primary efficacy outcomes included ankle brachial index. Secondary efficacy outcomes included fasting plasma glucose, blood lipid, hemorheology indexes, advanced glycation end products, the inner diameter, peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity and mean average velocity of the anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis artery, and TCM syndrome score. The safety and endpoint outcomes will be evaluated in this trial. The study will explain the biological therapeutic mechanism of Shen-Qi Hua-Yu formula for diabetic LEAD, and try to use Isobaric tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) and Western blot to screen biomarkers of characteristic diagnosis and clinical efficiency evaluation of the TCM syndrome. Discussion: This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHM in patients with diabetic LEAD, and to interpret the therapeutic mechanism of Shen-Qi Hua-Yu formula in treatment of diabetic LEAD through proteomics technology, and to screen biomarkers with characteristics of TCM diagnosis and clinical efficacy evaluation. On the other hand, to our knowledge, this study may be the first trial of CHM formulas to observe cardiovascular outcomes through long-term follow-up for the treatment of diabetic LEAD, which is of great value.

AB  - The application of lipidomics, after genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, offered largely opportunities to illuminate the entire spectrum of lipidome based on a quantitative or semi-quantitative level in a biological system. When combined with advances in proteomics and metabolomics high-throughput platforms, lipidomics provided the opportunity for analyzing the unique roles of specific lipids in complex cellular processes. Abnormal lipid metabolism was demonstrated to be greatly implicated in many human lifestyle-related diseases. In this review, we focused on lipidomic applications in brain injury disease, cancer, metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and infectious disease to discover disease biomarkers and illustrate biochemical metabolic pathways. We also discussed the analytical techniques, future perspectives and potential problems of lipidomic applications. The application of lipidomics in disease biomarker discovery provides the opportunity for gaining novel insights into biochemical mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Discovery of protein biomarkers in different diseases is an important area of research in the field of proteomics. We have described the levels of protein biomarkers specific to diabetes mellitus type 2 in the local population of Pakistan using proteomic technology. Type 2 diabetic patients, age and sex-matched normal healthy controls were recruited from Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Plasma proteins were analysed by 2D liquid chromatographic system in which samples were initially fractionated by chromatofocusing and the selected fractions were further analysed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The proteins which showed variation between test and control samples were identified by MALDI-TOF analysis. All the samples belonging to the control and diabetic groups were then analyzed by ELISA and estimated four proteins which were found to vary. Levels of apolipoprotein A-I was found to decrease by -6.4% while apolipoprotein E, leptin and C reactive protein (CRP) were increased by +802, +842 and +872%, respectively, in the diabetic patients as compared to the controls. The discovery of these marker proteins might thus provide an adjunctive method for early detection of risk for this disease. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary: Chronic kidney disease remains a global health priority, only detected at relatively advanced stages by current markers. Identifying alternative markers for early detection is imperative. In this study, we profiled the urinary proteome in patients with albuminuria and well-preserved eGFR. We identified 80 proteins that were differentially abundant between the cases (albuminuria) and controls (normoalbuminuria). Among these, 12 proteins (SERPINA1, ALB, SERPINC1, AFM, PIGR, A1BG, COL6A1, MYG, LV39, MUC1, ICOSLG, and UMOD) had the highest discriminating abilities (area under curve > 0.8) between the cases and controls. When differentially abundant proteins were combined into an 80-protein model, the model was able to predict cases from controls with a predictive accuracy of 91.3%. The top five enriched biological pathways associated with the differentially abundant proteins included insulin growth factor functions, innate immunity, platelet degranulation, and extracellular matrix organization.
   Albuminuria may precede decreases in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and both tests are insensitive predictors of early stages of kidney disease. Our aim was to characterise the urinary proteome in black African individuals with albuminuria and well-preserved GFR from South Africa. This case-controlled study compared the urinary proteomes of 52 normoalbuminuric (urine albumin: creatinine ratio (uACR) < 3 mg/mmol) and 56 albuminuric (uACR >= 3 mg/mmol) adults of black African ethnicity. Urine proteins were precipitated, reduced, alkylated, digested, and analysed using an Evosep One LC (Evosep Biosystems, Odense, Denmark) coupled to a Sciex 5600 Triple-TOF (Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA) in data-independent acquisition mode. The data were searched on Spectronaut (TM) 15. Differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were filtered to include those with a >= 2.25-fold change and a false discovery rate <= 1%. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were used to assess the discriminating abilities of proteins of interest. Pathway analysis was performed using Enrichr software. As expected, the albuminuric group had higher uACR (7.9 vs. 0.55 mg/mmol, p < 0.001). The median eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m(2)) showed no difference between the groups (111 vs. 114, p = 0.707). We identified 80 DAPs in the albuminuria group compared to the normoalbuminuria group, of which 59 proteins were increased while 21 proteins were decreased in abundance. We found 12 urinary proteins with an AUC > 0.8 and a p < 0.001 in the multivariate analysis. Furthermore, an 80-protein model was developed that showed a high AUC > 0.907 and a predictive accuracy of 91.3% between the two groups. Pathway analysis found that the DAPs were involved in insulin growth factor (IGF) functions, innate immunity, platelet degranulation, and extracellular matrix organization. In albuminuric individuals with a well-preserved eGFR, pathways involved in preventing the release and uptake of IGF by insulin growth factor binding protein were significantly enriched. These proteins are indicative of a homeostatic imbalance in a variety of cellular processes underlying renal dysfunction and are implicated in chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis Metabolomics approaches in humans have identified around 40 plasma metabolites associated with insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes, which often coincide with those for obesity. We aimed to separate diabetes-associated from obesity-associated metabolite alterations in plasma and study the impact of metabolically important tissues on plasma metabolite concentrations.
   Methods Two obese mouse models were studied; one exclusively with obesity (ob/ob) and another with type 2 diabetes (db/db). Both models have impaired leptin signalling as a cause for obesity, but the different genetic backgrounds determine the susceptibility to diabetes. In these mice, we profiled plasma, liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue via semi-quantitative GC-MS and quantitative liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS for a wide range of metabolites.
   Results Metabolite profiling identified 24 metabolites specifically associated with diabetes but not with obesity. Among these are known markers such as 1,5-anhydro-d-sorbitol, 3-hydroxybutyrate and the recently reported marker glyoxylate. New metabolites in the diabetic model were lysine, O-phosphotyrosine and branched-chain fatty acids. We also identified 33 metabolites that were similarly altered in both models, represented by branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) as well as glycine, serine, trans-4-hydroxyproline, and various lipid species and derivatives. Correlation analyses showed stronger associations for plasma amino acids with adipose tissue metabolites in db/db mice compared with ob/ob mice, suggesting a prominent contribution of adipose tissue to changes in plasma in a diabetic state.
   Conclusions/interpretation By studying mice with metabolite signatures that resemble obesity and diabetes in humans, we have found new metabolite entities for validation in appropriate human cohorts and revealed their possible tissue of origin.

AB  - Background: Diet affects the development of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, but the underlying biological mechanisms are only partly understood. Objectives: This study aimed to identify proteomic markers of the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and their association with type 2 diabetes risk. Methods: We examined the associations between the AHEI and DASH diet quality scores and 1317 plasma proteins in African American participants of the Jackson Heart Study (JHS, n = 1878). These findings were validated in a Singapore Multi-Ethnic Cohort (n = 2395) and examined in relation to type 2 diabetes incidence (n = 539 cases). We adjusted for multiple testing by using false discovery rate-adjusted q values. Results: We identified 13 proteins consistently associated with the AHEI or DASH scores with the strongest associations for the AHEI score and epidermal growth factor receptor (beta:0.089; SE: 0.017; q < 0.001) and for the DASH score and tissue factor (beta:- 0.114; SE: 0.022; q < 0.001). Most of these proteins were related to inflammation, thrombosis, adipogenesis, and glucose metabolism. Concentrations of myeloperoxidase, epidermal growth factor receptor, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, coagulation factor Xa, contactin 4, kynureninase, neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1, and vesicular integral-membrane protein VIP36 were associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes in the Asian cohort. The diabetes odds ratio for a 2-fold higher protein abundance concentration ranged from 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.08) for neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 to 3.04 (95% CI: 2.13, 4.33) for kynureninase. Furthermore, genetic markers for myeloperoxidase and hepatocyte growth factor receptor were significantly associated with diabetes risk. Conclusions: Our study across geographically and ethnically diverse populations identified robust protein biomarkers for healthy dietary patterns. Furthermore, our findings suggest novel biological mechanisms linking dietary patterns with type 2 diabetes development.

AB  - Globally, diabetes mellitus is considered as emerging health emergency of twenty-first century. According to the International Diabetic Federation (IDF), 537 million people are currently living with diabetes and this number is projected to increase up to 783 million by 2045 (IDF Report 10th edition 2021). Individuals with type 2 diabetes remain asymptomatic for years or have already lost 50% to 70% of their pancreatic beta cells at the time of diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to discover more sensitive potential protein biomarker candidates capable of predicting progression to hyperglycemia before its onset (at pre-diabetes stage). To accomplish this, nano-liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (nano-LCMS) technique was applied to explore proteome of serum sample from people with normal glucose level (HbA1c <= 5.7%), pre-diabetes (HbA1c > 5.7% to < 6.5%), and type 2 diabetes (HbA1c >= 6.5%). Differential protein expression of 57 proteins were found between the study groups. Among these 12 proteins were found to be significantly differentially expressed. Proteins SERPINC1, APOA4, AHSG, ITIH4, A2M, VTN, HBB, JCHAIN, and IGHM were found common and with significantly higher expression in both pre-diabetes and diabetes groups as compared to the control. While proteins APOA2, CFB, and APCS were found exclusively significantly high in pre-diabetes group as compared to the diabetes group. The GO analysis resulted that these proteins are known to be performing the functions of modulator proteins, transfer/ carrier proteins, and most importantly are involved in inflammatory processes along with regulation of hydrolases and endopeptidases. The identified proteins hold potential for being early screening/diagnostic biomarker candidates of type 2 diabetes after further validation.

AB  - Diagnosis and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) will be characterized in the future by an increasing use of biomarkers-quantitative indicators of biologic or pathologic processes that vary continuously with progression of the process. "Classical" biomarkers of CKD progression include quantitative proteinuria, the percentage of sclerotic glomeruli or fractional interstitial fibrosis. New candidate biomarkers (e.g., urinary proteomic patterns) are being developed based on both mechanistic and "shotgun" approaches. Validation of potential biomarkers in prospective studies as surrogate endpoints for hard clinical outcomes is often complicated by the long lag time to the ultimate clinical outcome (e.g., end-stage renal disease). The very dense data sets that result from shotgun approaches on small numbers of patients carry a significant risk of model overfitting, leading to spurious associations. New analytic methods can help to decrease this risk. It is likely that clinical practice will come to depend increasingly on multiplex (vector) biomarkers used in conjunction with risk markers in early diagnosis as well as to guide therapy.

AB  - Obesity is a main global health issue and an outstanding cause of morbidity and mortality predisposing to type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases. Huge research efforts focused on gene expression, cellular signalling and metabolism in obesity have improved our understanding of these disorders; nevertheless, to bridge the gap between the regulation of gene expression and changes in signalling/metabolism, protein levels must be assessed. We have extensively analysed visceral adipose tissue from age-, T2DM- and gender-matched obese patients using high-throughput proteomics and systems biology methods to identify new biomarkers for the onset of T2DM in obesity, as well as to gain insight into the influence of aging and gender in these disorders. About 250 proteins showed significant abundance differences in the age, T2DM and gender comparisons. In diabetic patients, remarkable gender-specific hallmarks were discovered regarding redox status, immune response and adipose tissue accumulation. Both aging and T2DM processes were associated with mitochondrial remodelling, albeit through well-differentiated proteome changes. Systems biology analysis highlighted mitochondrial proteins that could play a key role in the age-dependent pathophysiology of T2DM. Our findings could serve as a framework for future research in Translational Medicine directed at improving the quality of life of obese patients.

AB  - Proteomic methods have found broad applications in kidney disease research and more specifically in diabetic nephropathy (DN) research. Proteomic methods such as 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis have been used to gain insight into glomerular and tubular nephropathies including DN. At the protein level, differences in high-abundant proteins in DN have been shown to reflect primarily differentially posttranslationally modified plasma proteins. Higher-sensitivity proteomic methods (eg, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) have pushed the boundaries on the known urinary proteome to include more than 1,500 proteins. These same high-sensitivity methods have been applied toward profiling urinary peptides, which has resulted in methods to diagnostically screen urine to differentiate between type-2 diabetes mellitus and type-1 diabetes mellitus urine, normal versus microalbuminuria, or by angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment. Proteomic methods are being used to show response to insulin gene therapy in an animal model or alterations in the renal cortex mitochondrial proteome with the development of the diabetic phenotype. Proteomic methods continue to aid in the discovery of new mechanisms of diabetic pathology and understanding of the etiology of diabetic complications.

AB  - Purpose: The poor performance of current tests for predicting the onset, progression and treatment response of diabetic nephropathy has engendered a search for more sensitive and specific urinary biomarkers. Our goal was to develop a new method for protein biomarker discovery in urine from these patients.
   Experimental design: We analyzed urine from normal subjects and patients with early and advanced nephropathy. Proteins were separated using a novel analysis process including immunodepletion of high-abundance proteins followed by two-stage LC fractionation of low-abundance proteins. The proteins in the fractions were sequenced using MS/MS.
   Results: Immunodepletion of selected high-abundance proteins followed by two-stage LC produced approximately 700 fractions, each less complex and more amenable to analysis than the mixture and requiring minimal processing for MS identification. Comparison of fractions between normal and diabetic nephropathy subjects revealed several low-abundance proteins that reproducibly distinguished low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from both high GFR diabetic and normal subjects, including uteroglobin, a protein previously associated with renal scarring.
   Conclusions and clinical relevance: We developed a novel method to identify low-abundance urinary proteins that enables the discovery of potential biomarkers to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with diabetic nephropathy.

AB  - Glycolipid metabolism disorder are major threats to human health and life. Genetic, environmental, psychological, cellular, and molecular factors contribute to their pathogenesis. Several studies demon-strated that neuroendocrine axis dysfunction, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, chronic inflammatory response, and gut microbiota dysbiosis are core pathological links associated with it. However, the under-lying molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of glycolipid metabolism disorder remain to be elu-cidated. Progress in high-throughput technologies has helped clarify the pathophysiology of glycolipid metabolism disorder. In the present review, we explored the ways and means by which genomics, tran-scriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and gut microbiomics could help identify novel candidate biomarkers for the clinical management of glycolipid metabolism disorder. We also discuss the limita-tions and recommended future research directions of multi-omics studies on these diseases.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Research Network of Computational and Structural Bio-technology.

AB  - Objective Early identification of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is key to prioritizing therapy and preventing permanent blindness. This study aims to propose a machine learning model for DR early diagnosis using metabolomics and clinical indicators. Methods From 2017 to 2018, 950 participants were enrolled from two affiliated hospitals of Wenzhou Medical University and Anhui Medical University. A total of 69 matched blocks including healthy volunteers, type 2 diabetes, and DR patients were obtained from a propensity score matching-based metabolomics study. UPLC-ESI-MS/MS system was utilized for serum metabolic fingerprint data. CART decision trees (DT) were used to identify the potential biomarkers. Finally, the nomogram model was developed using the multivariable conditional logistic regression models. The calibration curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, receiver operating characteristic curve, and decision curve analysis were applied to evaluate the performance of this predictive model. Results The mean age of enrolled subjects was 56.7 years with a standard deviation of 9.2, and 61.4% were males. Based on the DT model, 2-pyrrolidone completely separated healthy controls from diabetic patients, and thiamine triphosphate (ThTP) might be a principal metabolite for DR detection. The developed nomogram model (including diabetes duration, systolic blood pressure and ThTP) shows an excellent quality of classification, with AUCs (95% CI) of 0.99 (0.97-1.00) and 0.99 (0.95-1.00) in training and testing sets, respectively. Furthermore, the predictive model also has a reasonable degree of calibration. Conclusions The nomogram presents an accurate and favorable prediction for DR detection. Further research with larger study populations is needed to confirm our findings.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), encompassing myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. We hypothesized that those biomarkers indicative of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) seen in large vessel occlusion (LVO) may also be elevated in T2D and further enhanced by stress conditions; therefore, these proteins represent potentially predictive biomarkers for those T2D patients at high risk of AIS.Methods: We performed an exploratory proteomic analysis in control subjects (n = 23) versus those with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (n = 23) who underwent a hyperinsulinemic clamp study to transient severe hypoglycemia [blood glucose <2.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dl)] in a prospective case-control study. We compared these proteins described as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for AIS due to LVO: lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor-1 (LYVE1), thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP), and cadherin 1 (CDH1).Results: At baseline (BL), PPBP (p < 0.05), THBS1 (p < 0.05), and CDH1 (p < 0.01) were elevated in T2D; LYVE1 was not different between controls and T2D subjects at BL or at subsequent timepoints. PPBP and THBS1 tended to increase at hypoglycemia in both cohorts, though reached significance only in controls (p < 0.05), returning to BL levels post-hypoglycemia. CDH1 levels were higher in T2D at BL, at hypoglycemia and up to 2-h posthypoglycemia, thereafter reverting to BL levels.Conclusion: Elevated levels of PPBP, THBS1, and CDH1, circulatory proteins suggested as biomarkers of AIS due to LVO, may, in T2D patients, be prognostically indicative of a cohort of T2D patients at increased risk of ischaemic stroke. Prospective studies are needed to determine if this reflects future clinical risk.Clinical trial reg. no: NCT03102801.

AB  - Simply Summary A high-fat diet is widely recognized as a significant modifiable risk for metabolic diseases. In this study, untargeted metabolomics, combined with liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry, was used to evaluate perirenal adipose tissue metabolic changes. Our study revealed 206 differential metabolites. These metabolites were mainly associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway, the ovarian steroidogenesis pathway, and the platelet activation pathway. Our study revealed that a high-fat diet causes significant lipometabolic disorders; these metabolites may inhibit oxygen respiration by increasing adipocytes cells and density, cause mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, produce inflammation, and finally lead to insulin resistance, thereby increasing the risk of Type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and other metabolic syndromes. A high-fat diet (HFD) is widely recognized as a significant modifiable risk for insulin resistance, inflammation, Type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and other metabolic diseases. However, the biological mechanism responsible for key metabolic disorders in the PAT of rabbits subject to HFD remains unclear. Here, untargeted metabolomics (LC-MS/MS) combined with liquid chromatography (LC) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) were used to evaluate PAT metabolic changes. Histological observations showed that the adipocytes cells and density of PAT were significantly increased in HFD rabbits. Our study revealed 206 differential metabolites (21 up-regulated and 185 down-regulated); 47 differential metabolites (13 up-regulated and 34 down-regulated), comprising mainly phospholipids, fatty acids, steroid hormones and amino acids, were chosen as potential biomarkers to help explain metabolic disorders caused by HFD. These metabolites were mainly associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway, the ovarian steroidogenesis pathway, and the platelet activation pathway. Our study revealed that a HFD caused significant lipometabolic disorders. These metabolites may inhibit oxygen respiration by increasing the adipocytes cells and density, cause mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, produce inflammation, and finally lead to insulin resistance, thus increasing the risk of Type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and other metabolic syndromes.

AB  - Background: Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common medical complications of pregnancy. The untreated GDM affects both the baby and mother during gestation as well as presents the risk of subsequent type 2 diabetes in mothers and babies.
   Objective: To determine the effect of GDM on plasma proteomics as variable plasma proteins can be secreted by the cells at the pathological sites and can serve as a biomarker of the disease.
   Methods: Blood samples were taken from 400 pregnant women at early second trimester and they were followed till early third trimester or until the development of GDM. All the pregnant females were sampled again in 3rd trimester. Overall 42 pregnant females developed GDM. These females were grouped as GDM I and GDM II, before and after the development of gestational diabetes, respectively. An equivalent number of pregnant women who did not develop GDM served as control I and control II in early second and third trimester, respectively. Blood samples from all the groups were subjected to 2D gel electrophoresis.
   Results: Nineteen protein spots were differently expressed between GDM and control groups, two spots were further confirmed by LC-MS/MS as Retinol binding protein A4 and Transthyretin. These two proteins were found to be up regulated in GDM group in early second trimester as well as early 3rd trimester.
   Conclusion: Transthyretin and Retinol binding protein 4 can be used as predictive plasma biomarkers of GDM that might help in the identification of at-risk pregnancies, hence, providing the best opportunity for early treatment in order to prevent the onset or progression of the disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Owing to the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) becomes the major cause of end-stage renal disease. The current markers of diabetic nephropathy are based on albuminuria and clinical signs of retinopathy. Sensitive and specific noninvasive diagnostic tools, unbiased by the presence of comorbidities, are needed, especially to detect the early stages of diabetic complications.
   OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to analyze changes in urinary protein excretion based on the stage of DKD using quantitative proteomics.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 27 healthy controls were age-and sex-matched to 72 diabetes patients classified into 3 groups: no signs of retinopathy or nephropathy (n = 33), retinopathy but no microalbuminuria (n = 15), and diabetic nephropathy (DN) based on overt albuminuria or microalbuminuria with retinopathy (n = 24). To assess the intergroup differences, samples were partially pooled, tagged using 8-plex iTRAQ reagents, and the resulting peptide mixture was resolved by isoelectrofocusing. The obtained fractions were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Data were analyzed using the MASCOT software and dedicated in-house proteomic data analysis programs.
   RESULTS The changes in the urine proteome following DKD progression involved some known protein markers of DN and several other proteins. Decreased levels of some proteins are presumably related to impaired secretory function of other organs affected by diabetes. In particular, a diminished excretion of pancreatic amylase and deoxyribonuclease I suggested exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), coexisting with type 2 diabetes.
   CONCLUSIONS A decrease in the urinary excretion of some pancreatic enzymes suggests EPI associated with diabetes. This hypothesis is yet to be verified; nevertheless, renal and extrarenal confounders must be considered when interpreting the results of quantitative urinary proteomics.

AB  - Objectives: By exploring differences between patients with high and low coronary artery calcification score (CACS), a plasma protein biomarker might be identified as an alternative to CACS screening.
   Methods: We selected stored samples (12 per group) from a cohort study of patients with Type 2 diabetes and CACS > 1000 or < 100 Agatston units, with matching for age, BMI, blood pressure, lipids and lipoproteins and fibrinogen. Multiplex, immunobead-based assay or ELISA measured 18 cardiovascular-related protein biomarkers. SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) screened for proteins differing significantly between high and low CACS.
   Results: Only monocyte chemotactic protein-1 was higher in the high compared with the low CACS group but concentrations overlapped appreciably. On SELDI-TOF MS, several mass/charge ratio peak intensities significantly discriminated high and low CACS but these differences were not confirmed in larger samples from the cohort.
   Conclusions: Plasma protein biomarkers are unlikely to provide an effective alternative to measurement of CACS. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become the main cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide, causing significant health problems. Early diagnosis of the disease is quite inadequate. To screen urine biomarkers of DN and explore its potential mechanism, this study collected urine from 87 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (which will be classified into normal albuminuria, microalbuminuria, and macroalbuminuria groups) and 38 healthy subjects. Twelve individuals from each group were then randomly selected as the screening cohort for proteomics analysis and the rest as the validation cohort. The results showed that humoral immune response, complement activation, complement and coagulation cascades, renin-angiotensin system, and cell adhesion molecules were closely related to the progression of DN. Five overlapping proteins (KLK1, CSPG4, PLAU, SERPINA3, and ALB) were identified as potential biomarkers by machine learning methods. Among them, KLK1 and CSPG4 were positively correlated with the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), and SERPINA3 was negatively correlated with the UACR, which were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This study provides new insights into disease mechanisms and biomarkers for early diagnosis of DN.

AB  - Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an important water-soluble antioxidant associated with decreased oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. A previous targeted plasma proteomic study has indicated that ascorbic acid is associated with markers of the immune system in healthy subjects. However, the association between the levels of ascorbic acid and blood biomarkers in subjects at risk of developing T2D is still unknown. Serum ascorbic acid was measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography and serum proteins were quantified by untargeted liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry in 25 hyperinsulinemia subjects that were randomly assigned a high dairy intake diet or an adequate dairy intake diet for 6 weeks, then crossed-over after a 6-week washout period. Spearman correlation followed by gene ontology analyses were performed to identify biological pathways associated with ascorbic acid. Finally, machine learning analysis was performed to obtain a specific serum protein signature that could predict ascorbic acid levels. After adjustments for waist circumference, LDL, HDL, fasting insulin, fasting blood glucose, age, gender, and dairy intake; serum ascorbic acid correlated positively with different aspects of the immune system. Machine learning analysis indicated that a signature composed of 21 features that included 17 proteins (mainly from the immune system), age, sex, waist circumference, and LDL could predict serum ascorbic acid levels in hyperinsulinemia subjects. In conclusion, the result reveals a correlation as well as modulation between serum ascorbic acid levels and proteins that play vital roles in regulating different aspects of the immune response in individuals at risk of T2D. The development of a predictive signature for ascorbic acid will further help the assessment of ascorbic acid status in clinical settings.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abnormal glucose handling has emerged as a major clinical problem in millions of diabetic patients worldwide. Insulin resistance affects especially one of the main target organs of this hormone, the skeletal musculature, making impaired glucose metabolism in contractile fibres a major feature of type 2 diabetes. High levels of circulating free fatty acids, an increased intramyocellular lipid content, impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake, diminished mitochondrial functioning and an overall weakened metabolic flexibility are pathobiochemical hallmarks of diabetic skeletal muscles. In order to increase our cellular understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie this complex diabetes-associated skeletal muscle pathology, we initiated herein a mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of skeletal muscle preparations from the non-obese Goto-Kakizaki rat model of type 2 diabetes. Following staining of high-resolution two-dimensional gels with colloidal Coomassie Blue, 929 protein spots were detected, whereby 21 proteins showed a moderate differential expression pattern. Decreased proteins included carbonic anhydrase, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase and enolase. Increased proteins were identified as monoglyceride lipase, adenylate kinase, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, phosphoglucomutase, aldolase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase, small heat shock Hsp27/B1, actin and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. These proteomic findings suggest that the diabetic phenotype is associated with a generally perturbed protein expression pattern, affecting especially glucose, fatty acid, nucleotide and amino acid metabolism, as well as the contractile apparatus, the cellular stress response, the anti-oxidant defense system and detoxification mechanisms. The altered expression levels of distinct skeletal muscle proteins, as documented in this study, might be helpful for the future establishment of a comprehensive biomarker signature of type 2 diabetes. Reliable markers could be used for improving diagnostics, monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic evaluations.

AB  - BackgroundSaliva is a protein-rich body fluid for noninvasive discovery of biomolecules, containing both human and microbial components, associated with various chronic diseases. Type-2 diabetes (T2D) imposes a significant health and socio-economic burden. Prior research on T2D salivary microbiome utilized methods such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, 16S rRNA sequencing, and low-throughput proteomics.ResultsWe conducted ultrafast, in-depth MS-based proteomic and metaproteomic profiling of saliva from 15 newly diagnosed T2D individuals and 15 age-/BMI-matched healthy controls (HC). Using state-of-the-art proteomics, over 4500 human and bacterial proteins were identified in a single 21-min run. Bioinformatic analysis revealed host signatures of altered immune-, lipid-, and glucose-metabolism regulatory systems, increased oxidative stress, and possible precancerous changes in T2D saliva. Abundance of peptides for bacterial genera such as Neisseria and Corynebacterium were altered showing biomarker potential, offering insights into disease pathophysiology and microbial applications for T2D management.ConclusionsThis study presents a comprehensive mapping of salivary proteins and microbial communities, serving as a foundational resource for enhancing understanding of T2D pathophysiology.

AB  - Glycolysis represents one of the best-understood and most ancient metabolic pathways. In skeletal muscle fibres, energy for contraction is supplied by adenosine triphosphate via anaerobic glycolysis, the phosphocreatine shuttle and oxidative phosphorylation. In this respect, the anaerobic glycolytic pathway supports short duration performances of contractile tissues of high intensity. The catalytic elements associated with glycolysis are altered during development, muscle differentiation, physiological adaptations and many pathological mechanisms, such as muscular dystrophy, diabetes mellitus and age-related muscle weakness. Although gel electrophoresis-based proteomics is afflicted with various biological and technical problems, it is an ideal analytical tool for studying the abundant and mostly soluble enzymes that constitute the glycolytic system. This review critically examines the proteomic findings of recent large-scale studies of glycolytic enzymes and associated components in normal, transforming and degenerating muscle tissues. In the long term, proteins belonging to the glycolytic pathway may be useful as biomarkers of muscle adaptations and pathophysiological mechanisms and can be employed to improve diagnostics and in the identification of novel therapeutic targets in neuromuscular disorders.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an aging-related disorder that represents a major global public health burden. Current biochemical biomarkers, such as serum creatinine and urinary albumin, have important limitations when used to identify the earliest indication of CKD or in tracking the progression to more advanced CKD. These issues underline the importance of finding and testing new molecular biomarkers that are capable of successfully meeting this clinical need.
   The measurement of changes in nature and/or levels of proteins and metabolites in biological samples from patients provide insights into pathophysiological processes. Proteomic and metabolomic techniques provide opportunities to record dynamic chemical signatures in patients over time.
   This review article presents an overview of the recent developments in the fields of metabolomics and proteomics in relation to CKD. Among the many different proteomic biomarkers proposed, there is particular interest in the CKD273 classifier, a urinary proteome biomarker reported to predict CKD progression and with implementation potential. Other individual non-invasive peptidomic biomarkers that are potentially relevant for CKD detection include type 1 collagen, uromodulin and mucin-1. Despite the limited sample sizes and variability of the metabolomics studies, some metabolites such as trimethylamine N-oxide, kynurenine and citrulline stand out as potential biomarkers in CKD.

AB  - ObjectiveIndividuals living with obesity are differentially susceptible to cardiometabolic diseases. We hypothesized that an integrative multi-omics approach might improve identification of subgroups of individuals with obesity who have distinct cardiometabolic disease patterns.MethodsWe performed machine learning-based, integrative unsupervised clustering to identify proteomics- and metabolomics-defined subpopulations of individuals living with obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m2), leveraging data from 243 individuals in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort. Omics that contributed to the observed clusters were functionally characterized. We performed multivariate regression to assess whether the individuals in each cluster demonstrated differential patterns of cardiometabolic traits.ResultsWe identified two distinct clusters (iCluster1 and 2). iCluster2 had significantly higher average BMI values, fasting blood glucose, and inflammation. iCluster1 was associated with higher levels of total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Pathways mediating cell growth, lipogenesis, and energy expenditures were positively associated with iCluster1. Inflammatory response and insulin resistance pathways were positively associated with iCluster2.ConclusionsAlthough the two identified clusters may represent progressive obesity-related pathologic processes measured at different stages, other mechanisms in combination could also underpin the identified clusters given no significant age difference between the comparative groups. For instance, clusters may reflect differences in dietary/behavioral patterns or differential rates of metabolic damage.

AB  - Metabolic disorders are increasingly prevalent worldwide, leading to high rates of morbidity and mortality. The variety of metabolic illnesses can be addressed through personalized medicine. The goal of personalized medicine is to give doctors the ability to anticipate the best course of treatment for patients with metabolic problems. By analyzing a patient's metabolomic, proteomic, genetic profile, and clinical data, physicians can identify relevant diagnostic, and predictive biomarkers and develop treatment plans and therapy for acute and chronic metabolic diseases. To achieve this goal, real-time modeling of clinical data and multiple omics is essential to pinpoint underlying biological mechanisms, risk factors, and possibly useful data to promote early diagnosis and prevention of complex diseases. Incorporating cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning is crucial for consolidating diverse forms of data, examining multiple variables, establishing databases of clinical indicators to aid decision-making, and formulating ethical protocols to address concerns. This review article aims to explore the potential of personalized medicine utilizing omics approaches for the treatment of metabolic disorders. It focuses on the recent advancements in genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and nutrigenomics, emphasizing their role in revolutionizing personalized medicine.

AB  - over the last few decades of biomedical research, animal models of neuromuscular diseases have been widely used for determining pathological mechanisms and for testing new therapeutic strategies. With the emergence of high-throughput proteomics technology, the identification of novel protein factors involved in disease processes has been decisively improved. This review outlines the usefulness of the proteomic profiling of animal disease models for the discovery of new reliable biomarkers, for the optimization of diagnostic procedures and the development of new treatment options for skeletal muscle disorders. Since inbred animal strains show genetically much less interindividual differences as compared to human patients, considerably lower experimental repeats are capable of producing meaningful proteomic data. Thus, animal model proteomics can be conveniently employed for both studying basic mechanisms of molecular pathogenesis and the effects of drugs, genetic modifications or cell-based therapies on disease progression. Based on the results from comparative animal proteomics, a more informed decision on the design of clinical proteomics studies could be reached. Since no one animal model represents a perfect pathobiochemical replica of all of the symptoms seen in complex human disorders, the proteomic screening of novel animal models can also be employed for swift and enhanced protein biochemical phenotyping.

AB  - OBJECTIVE-Obesity is associated with endocrine abnormalities that predict the progression of insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes. Because skeletal muscle has been shown to secrete proteins that could be used as biomarkers, we characterized the secreted protein profile of muscle cells derived from extremely obese (BMI 48.8 +/- 14.8 kg/m(2); homeostasis model assessment [HOMA] 3.6 +/- 1.0) relative to lean healthy subjects (BMI 25.7 +/- 3.2 kg/m(2); HOMA 0.8 +/- 0.2).
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We hypothesized that skeletal muscle would secrete proteins that predict the severity of obesity. To test this hypothesis, we used a "bottom-up" experimental design using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in culture (SILAC) and liquid chromatography/mass spectometry/ mass spectometry (LC-MS/MS) to both identify and quantify proteins secreted from cultured myotubes derived from extremely obese compared with healthy nonobese women.
   RESULTS-Using SILAC, we discovered a 2.9-fold increase in the secretion of myostatin from extremely obese human myotubes. The increased secretion and biological activity of myostatin were validated by immunoblot (3.16 +/- 0.18, P < 0.01) and a myoblast proliferation assay using conditioned growth medium. Myostatin was subsequently shown to increase in skeletal muscle (23%, P < 0.05) and plasma (35%, P < 0.05) and to correlate (r(2) = 0.6, P < 0.05) with the severity of insulin resistance.
   CONCLUSIONS-Myostatin is a potent antianabolic regulator of muscle mass that may also play a role in energy metabolism. These findings show that increased expression of myostatin in skeletal muscle with obesity and insulin resistance results in elevated circulating myostatin. This may contribute to systemic metabolic deterioration of skeletal muscle with the progression of insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes. Diabetes 58:30-38, 2009

AB  - BackgroundDiabetes mellitus (DM), either preexisting or developing after transplantation, remains a crucial clinical problem in kidney transplantation. To obtain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PTDM development and early glomerular damage before the development of histologically visible diabetic kidney disease, we comparatively analysed the proteome of histologically normal glomeruli from patients with PTDM and normoglycaemic (NG) transplant recipients. Moreover, to assess specificities inherent in PTDM, we also comparatively evaluated glomerular proteomes from transplant recipients with preexisting type 2 DM (T2DM).MethodsProtocol biopsies were obtained from adult NG, PTDM and T2DM patients one year after kidney transplantation. Biopsies were formalin-fixed and embedded in paraffin, and glomerular cross-sections were microdissected. A total of 4 NG, 7 PTDM and 6 T2DM kidney biopsies were used for the analysis. The proteome was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Relative differences in protein abundance and significantly dysregulated pathways were analysed.ResultsProteins involved in cell adhesion, immune response, leukocyte transendothelial filtration, and cell localization and organization were less abundant in glomeruli from PTDM patients than in those from NG patients, and proteins associated with supramolecular fibre organization and protein-containing complex binding were more abundant in PTDM patients. Overall, proteins related to adherens and tight junctions and those related to the immune system, including leukocyte transendothelial migration, were more abundant in NG patients than in transplanted patients with DM, irrespective of the timing of its development. However, proteins included in cell-cell junctions and adhesion, insulin resistance, and vesicle-mediated transport were all less abundant in PTDM patients than in T2DM patients.ConclusionsThe glomerular proteome profile differentiates PTDM from NG and T2DM, suggesting specific pathogenetic mechanisms. Further studies are warranted to validate these results, potentially leading to an improved understanding of PTDM kidney transplant pathophysiology and to the identification of novel biomarkers.

AB  - A method was developed for the analysis of four ceramide species; namely C16:0, C18:0, C24:0 and C24:1 in quantitative Dried Blood Samples (qDBS) by LC-MS/MS and validated with the aim to give prominence to an interesting application of at-home blood microsampling for health monitoring. Ceramides, being key-role me-tabolites implicated in regulation of diverse cellular processes have been considered as emerging biomarkers for different disease states, such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and others. Here, Capitainer device was utilized to provide accurate and consistent volumes of samples, ideal for accurate determinations. The method requires a 10 mu L sample offering duplicate analysis by device, is quick and enables the sample collection by distance as it was proved that ceramides under study were stable at various conditions, including RT. Intra and inter-day accuracy of the determination were estimated between 87.6% -113% and 90.6% -113%, respectively, while intra-and inter-day precision were calculated from 0.2% to 9.9% %RSD and 0.1% - 8.0% %RSD, respectively. The data acquired by ten healthy individuals indicated that circulating ceramides are at higher levels in whole blood taken from the fingertip in comparison to the reported values in plasma or serum.

AB  - Context Patients with younger onset of type 2 diabetes (YT2D) have increased risk for kidney failure compared to those with late onset. However, the mechanism of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression in this high-risk group is poorly understood. Objective This work aimed to identify novel biomarkers and potential causal proteins associated with DKD progression in patients with YT2D. Methods Among YT2D (T2D onset age <40 years), 144 DKD progressors (cases) were matched for T2D onset age, sex, and ethnicity with 292 nonprogressors (controls) and divided into discovery and validation sets. DKD progression was defined as decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 3 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater or 40% decline in eGFR from baseline. A total of 1472 plasma proteins were measured through a multiplex immunoassay that uses a proximity extension assay technology. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify proteins associated with DKD progression. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to evaluate causal relationship between plasma proteins and DKD progression. Results Forty-two plasma proteins were associated with DKD progression, independent of traditional cardiorenal risk factors, baseline eGFR, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. The proteins identified were related to inflammatory and remodeling biological processes. Our findings suggest angiogenin as one of the top signals (odds ratio = 5.29; 95% CI, 2.39-11.73; P = 4.03 x 10-5). Furthermore, genetically determined plasma angiogenin level was associated with increased odds of DKD progression. Conclusion Large-scale proteomic analysis identified novel proteomic biomarkers for DKD progression in YT2D. Genetic evidence suggest a causal role of plasma angiogenin in DKD progression.

AB  - With an estimated prevalence of 463 million affected, type 2 diabetes represents a major challenge to health care systems worldwide. Analyzing the plasma proteomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes may illuminate hitherto unknown functional mechanisms underlying disease pathology. We assessed the associations between type 2 diabetes and >1,000 plasma proteins in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) F4 cohort (n = 993, 110 cases), with subsequent replication in the third wave of the Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT3) cohort (n = 940, 149 cases). We computed logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and hypertension. Additionally, we investigated associations with incident type 2 diabetes and performed two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to prioritize our results. Association analysis of prevalent type 2 diabetes revealed 24 replicated proteins, of which 8 are novel. Proteins showing association with incident type 2 diabetes were aminoacylase-1, growth hormone receptor, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2. Aminoacylase-1 was associated with both prevalent and incident type 2 diabetes. MR analysis yielded nominally significant causal effects of type 2 diabetes on cathepsin Z and rennin, both known to have roles in the pathophysiological pathways of cardiovascular disease, and of sex hormone-binding globulin on type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, our high-throughput proteomics study replicated previously reported type 2 diabetes-protein associations and identified new candidate proteins possibly involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Personalized nutrition (PN) has gained much attention as a tool for empowerment of consumers to promote changes in dietary behavior, optimizing health status and preventing diet related diseases. Generalized implementation of PN faces different obstacles, one of the most relevant being metabolic characterization of the individual. Although omics technologies allow for assessment the dynamics of metabolism with unprecedented detail, its translatability as affordable and simple PN protocols is still difficult due to the complexity of metabolic regulation and to different technical and economical constrains. In this work, we propose a conceptual framework that considers the dysregulation of a few overarching processes, namely Carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress and microbiota-derived metabolites, as the basis of the onset of several non-communicable diseases. These processes can be assessed and characterized by specific sets of proteomic, metabolomic and genetic markers that minimize operational constrains and maximize the information obtained at the individual level. Current machine learning and data analysis methodologies allow the development of algorithms to integrate omics and genetic markers. Reduction of dimensionality of variables facilitates the implementation of omics and genetic information in digital tools. This framework is exemplified by presenting the EU-Funded project PREVENTOMICS as a use case.

AB  - Purpose: Urinary peptidome changes and discrimination for potential renal glomerular and tubular damage after 6 wk of fenofibrate treatment were evaluated in 26 healthy subjects.
   Experimental design: Peptide profiling was performed in urine samples before and after treatment using high-resolution capillary electrophoresis coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
   Results: A panel of 88 fenofibrate-sensitive peptides was detected with a frequency of >= 50% before and after treatment. This was reduced to 36 peptides by repeating the comparison ten times by randomly excluding samples at each time-point. Nineteen peptides were consistent and reliable biomarkers after an additional comparison with an age and sex-matched subject control group. Levels of peptides identified as fragments of Collagen alpha-1 (I), Collagen alpha-1 (XVII), Collagen alpha-2 (VIII) or sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit gamma were reduced after fenofibrate treatment. Classification scores for renal tubular and glomerular damages determined by support vector machine based biomarker models increased after treatment but remained below pathological score cutoff values.
   Conclusions and clinical relevance: Fenofibrate treatment led to minor modifications of the urinary proteomic profile in a way that does not create safety issues affecting glomerular and tubular functions. Urinary peptide profiling proved to be appropriate to monitor drug pharmacological effects in a clinical setting.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent the most important cause of mortality in women and in men. Contrary to the long-standing notion that the effects of the major risk factors on CVD outcomes are the same in both sexes, recent evidence recognizes new, potentially independent, sex/gender-related risk factors for CVDs, and sex/gender-differences in the clinical presentation of CVDs have been demonstrated. Furthermore, some therapeutic options may not be equally effective and safe in men and women. In this context, proteomics offers an extremely useful and versatile analytical platform for biomedical researches that expand from the screening of early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to the investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying CDVs. In this review, we summarized the current applications of proteomics in the cardiovascular field, with emphasis on sex and gender-related differences in CVDs.
   Significance: Increasing evidence supports the profound effect of sex and gender on cardiovascular physio-pathology and the response to drugs. A clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphisms in CVDs would not only improve our knowledge of the etiology of these diseases, but could also inform health policy makers and guideline committees in tailoring specific interventions for the prevention, treatment and management of CVDs in both men and women.

AB  - Objective Detailed proteomic analysis in a cohort of patients with differing severity of COVID-19 disease identified biomarkers within the complement and coagulation cascades as biomarkers for disease severity has been reported; however, it is unclear if these proteins differ sufficiently from other conditions to be considered as biomarkers. Methods A prospective, parallel study in T2D (n = 23) and controls (n = 23). A hyperinsulinemic clamp was performed and normoglycemia induced in T2D [4.5 +/- 0.07 mmol/L (81 +/- 1.2 mg/dl)] for 1-h, following which blood glucose was decreased to <= 2.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dl). Proteomic analysis for the complement and coagulation cascades were measured using Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan. Results Thirty-four proteins were measured. At baseline, 4 of 18 were found to differ in T2D versus controls for platelet degranulation [Neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (p = 0.014), Thrombospondin-1 (p = 0.012), Platelet factor-4 (p = 0.007), and Kininogen-1 (p = 0.05)], whilst 3 of 16 proteins differed for complement and coagulation cascades [Coagulation factor IX (p < 0.05), Kininogen-1 (p = 0.05), and Heparin cofactor-2 (p = 0.007)]; STRING analysis demonstrated the close relationship of these proteins to one another. Induced euglycemia in T2D showed no protein changes versus baseline. At hypoglycemia, however, four proteins changed in controls from baseline [Thrombospondin-1 (p < 0.014), platelet factor-4 (p < 0.01), Platelet basic protein (p < 0.008), and Vitamin K-dependent protein-C (p < 0.00003)], and one protein changed in T2D [Vitamin K-dependent protein-C, (p < 0.0002)]. Conclusion Seven of 34 proteins suggested to be biomarkers of COVID-19 severity within the platelet degranulation and complement and coagulation cascades differed in T2D versus controls, with further changes occurring at hypoglycemia, suggesting that validation of these biomarkers is critical. It is unclear if these protein changes in T2D may predict worse COVID-19 disease for these patients.

AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease encompasses a spectrum of liver diseases, including simple steatosis, steatohepatitis. liver fibrosis and cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is currently the most dominant chronic liver disease in Western countries due to the fact that hepatic steatosis is associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome and drug-induced injury. A variety of chemicals, mainly drugs, and diets is known to cause hepatic steatosis in humans and rodents. Experimental non-alcoholic fatty liver disease models rely on the application of a diet or the administration of drugs to laboratory animals or the exposure of hepatic cell lines to these drugs. More recently, genetically modified rodents or zebrafish have been introduced as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease models. Considerable interest now lies in the discovery and development of novel non-invasive biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, with specific focus on hepatic steatosis. Experimental diagnostic biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, such as (epi)genetic parameters and '-omics'-based read-outs are still in their infancy, but show great promise. In this paper, the array of tools and models for the study of liver steatosis is discussed. Furthermore, the current state-of-art regarding experimental biomarkers such as epigenetic, genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabonomic biomarkers will be reviewed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is increasing worldwide in parallel with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Identifying diagnostic biomarkers for DN at an early stage is crucial due to the considerable societal and economic burden associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) and its risk factors. In the past, early indicators of microvascular problems, such as microalbuminuria (MA), have been used to predict the possibility of developing advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, because of the incapacity of MA to appropriately estimate DN, particularly, non-albuminuric DN, additional markers have been suggested for recognizing the early renal abnormalities and structural lesions, even before MA. This study aims to assess the existing and future biomarkers used to diagnose or predict early DN. This review provides comprehensive insight into diagnostic approaches for early detection of CKD, addressing the following areas: (i) markers of glomerular damage, (ii) markers of tubular damage, (iii) oxidative stress biomarkers, (iv) inflammatory biomarkers and (v) futuristic biomarkers such as micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs), proteomics, metabolomics and genomics and gut microbiota. Early detection of DN may lead to improvement in clinical management and quality of life, emphasizing the importance of identifying a specific and reliable predictive biomarker. Emerging serum and urinary biomarkers offer promise for early DN diagnosis, potentially reducing prevalence and preventing progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Further advancements in miRNAs, proteomics, metabolomics genomics and gut microbiota offer prospects for even earlier and more precise DN diagnosis.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent the most important cause of mortality in women and in men. Contrary to the long-standing notion that the effects of the major risk factors on CVD outcomes are the same in both sexes, recent evidence recognizes new, potentially independent, sex/gender-related risk factors for CVDs, and sex/gender-differences in the clinical presentation of CVDs have been demonstrated. Furthermore, some therapeutic options may not be equally effective and safe in men and women. In this context, proteomics offers an extremely useful and versatile analytical platform for biomedical researches that expand from the screening of early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to the investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying CDVs. In this review, we summarized the current applications of proteomics in the cardiovascular field, with emphasis on sex and gender-related differences in CVDs.
   Significance: Increasing evidence supports the profound effect of sex and gender on cardiovascular physio-pathology and the response to drugs. A clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphisms in CVDs would not only improve our knowledge of the etiology of these diseases, but could also inform health policy makers and guideline committees in tailoring specific interventions for the prevention, treatment and management of CVDs in both men and women.

AB  - Background: In the past decade, researchers have been focused on discovering protein biomarkers for diabetic kidney disease. This paper aims to search for, analyze, and synthesize current updates regarding the development of these efforts. Methods: We systematically searched the ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and PubMed databases for observational studies of protein biomarkers in patients with diabetes mellitus. We included studies published between January 2018 and April 2020, that were based on a population of patients with type-1 or type-2 diabetes mellitus aged > 18 years, with an observational design such as cross-sectional, case-control, or cohort studies. The dependent variable of the research results was in the form of protein biomarkers from urine, plasma, or serum. Results: Following the screening process, 20 research articles with available full text met the inclusion criteria. These could be categorized as glomerular biomarkers (ANGPTL4, beta-2 microglobulin, Smad1, and glypican-5); inflammatory biomarkers (MCP-1 and adiponectin); and tubular biomarkers (NGAL, VDBP, megalin, sKlotho, and KIM-1). The development of a panel of biomarkers showed more promising results than those for a single biomarker in diagnosing diabetic kidney disease. Conclusion: All the biomarkers discussed in this review showed promising results for predicting diabetic kidney disease because they correlate with albuminuria, eGFR, or both. However, of the 11 protein biomarkers, none have prognostic value beyond albuminuria and eGFR.

AB  - Background: The urinary proteomic classifier CKD273 has shown promise for prediction of progressive diabetic nephropathy (DN). Whether it is also a determinant of mortality and cardiovascular disease in patients with microalbuminuria (MA) is unknown.
   Methods: Urine samples were obtained from 155 patients with type 2 diabetes and confirmed microalbuminuria. Proteomic analysis was undertaken using capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry to determine the CKD273 classifier score. A previously defined CKD273 threshold of 0.343 for identification of DN was used to categorise the cohort in Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models with all-cause mortality as the primary endpoint. Outcomes were traced through national health registers after 6 years.
   Results: CKD273 correlated with urine albumin excretion rate (UAER) (r = 0.481, p = <0.001), age (r = 0.238, p = 0.003), coronary artery calcium (CAC) score (r = 0.236, p = 0.003), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (r = 0.190, p = 0.018) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (r = 0.265, p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis only UAER (beta = 0.402, p < 0.001) and eGFR (beta = -0.184, p = 0.039) were statistically significant determinants of CKD273. Twenty participants died during follow-up. CKD273 was a determinant of mortality (log rank [ Mantel-Cox] p = 0.004), and retained significance (p = 0.048) after adjustment for age, sex, blood pressure, NT-proBNP and CAC score in a Cox regression model.
   Conclusion: A multidimensional biomarker can provide information on outcomes associated with its primary diagnostic purpose. Here we demonstrate that the urinary proteomic classifier CKD273 is associated with mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes and MA even when adjusted for other established cardiovascular and renal biomarkers.

AB  - BackgroundThe rising prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in the Qatari population presents a significant public health challenge, highlighting the need for innovative approaches to early detection and management. While most efforts are centered on using blood samples for biomarker discovery, the use of saliva remains underexplored.MethodsUsing noninvasive saliva samples from 2974 Qatari subjects, we analyzed the microbial communities from diabetic, pre-diabetic, and non-diabetic participants based on their HbA1C levels. The salivary microbiota was assessed in all subjects by sequencing the V1-V3 regions of 16S rRNA gene. For the proteomics profiling, we randomly selected 50 gender and age-matched non-diabetic and diabetic subjects and compared their proteome with SOMAscan. Microbiota and proteome profiles were then integrated to reveal candidate biomarkers for T2D.ResultsOur results indicate that the salivary microbiota of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals differs significantly from that of non-diabetic subjects. Specifically, a significant increase in the abundance of Campylobacter, Dorea, and Bacteroidales was observed in the diabetic subjects compared to their non-diabetic controls. Metabolic pathway prediction analysis for these bacteria revealed a significant overrepresentation of genes associated with fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis, as well as aromatic amino acid metabolism in the diabetic group. Additionally, we observed distinct differences in salivary proteomic profiles between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Notably, levels of Haptoglobin, Plexin-C1, and MCL-1 were elevated, while Osteopontin (SPP1), Histone1H3A (HIST3H2A), and Histone H1.2 were reduced in diabetic individuals. Furthermore, integrated correlation analysis of salivary proteome and microbiota data demonstrated a strong positive correlation between HIST1H3A and HIST3H2A with Porphyromonas sp., all of which were decreased in the diabetic group.ConclusionThis is the first study to assess the salivary microbiota in T2D patients from a large cohort of the Qatari population. We found significant differences in the salivary microbiota of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals compared to non-diabetic controls. Our study is also the first to assess the salivary proteome using SOMAScan in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Integration of the microbiota and proteome profiles revealed a unique signature for T2D that can be used as potential T2D biomarkers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cholesterol precursors and plant sterols have considerable potential as plasma biomarkers in several disorders of sterol metabolism and intestinal sterol absorption. Oxysterols are associated with atherogenesis, neurodegeneration, and inflammation. We developed a GC-MS method for the simultaneous analysis of these species in human plasma, including 24-, 25-, 27-hydroxycholesterol; 7-ketocholesterol; lanosterol; lathosterol; 7-dehydrocholesterol; desmosterol; stigmasterol; sitosterol; and campesterol.
   METHODS: Sterols were hydrolyzed with ethanolic potassium hydroxide solution, extracted by liquid/liquid extraction with n-hexane, and derivatized with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoracetamide. Positive chemical ionization with ammonia, as reagent gas, was applied to generate high abundant precursor ions.
   RESULTS: The definition of highly sensitive precursor/product ion transitions, especially for coeluting substances, allowed fast gas chromatography run times of under 8.5 min. Using the multiple reaction monitoring mode, detection limits in the picogram per milliliter range could be achieved for most compounds. The method was validated for precision and recovery. Intraassay and interassay CVs were mostly <15% for serum and plasma samples. The recoveries of supplemented plasma samples in different concentrations were 88%-117%. The method was applied to stratification of patients with disorders in cholesterol biosynthesis and/or cholesterol absorption in hypercholesterolemia. The method revealed associations of sterol species with thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes.
   CONCLUSIONS: This method allows high-throughput sterol profiling in various diseases. (C) 2012 American Association for Clinical Chemistry

AB  - Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disease with a group of metabolic derangements and inflammatory reactants in the serum. Despite the substantial public health implications, markers of diabetes progression with abdominal obesity are still needed to facilitate early detection and treatment. In this study, we performed a proteomic approach to identify differential target proteins underlying diabetes progression in patients with abdominal obesity. Proteomic differences were investigated in the serum of controls and patients with prediabetes or diabetes with or without abdominal obesity by 2-DE combined with MALDI-TOF-MS. Proteomics data were validated by western blot analyses and major protein-protein interactions were assessed using a network analysis with String database. Among 245 matched protein spots, 36 exhibited marked differences in normal patients with abdominal obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes compared to levels in normal patients without abdominal obesity. Seven (Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, Alpha-1-antitrypsin, Apolipoprotein A-I, haptoglobin, retinol-binding protein 4, transthyretin, and zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein) of these spots exhibited significant differences between normal and prediabetes/diabetes patients. After a network analysis, functional annotation using Gene Ontology indicated that most of the identified proteins were involved in lipid transport, lipid localization, and the regulation of serum lipo-protein particle levels. Our results indicated that variation in the levels of these identified protein biomarkers has been reported in normal, prediabetes and diabetic Assessment of the levels of these biomarkers may contribute to the development of biomarkers for not only early diagnosis but also in prognosis of diabetes mellitus type 2.

AB  - Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) is defined by coexisting heart and renal dysfunctions. Malfunction of 1 organ may cause dysfunction of the other with variable causative disease that defines the type of CRS (1-5). Numerous studies showed that the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is increased in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Similarly, CKD affects a large proportion of patients with heart failure. This overlap between primary heart or primary kidney disease blurs cause-effect inferences of the initiator/target organ. The classical subdivision of CRS in 5 categories does not provide pathophysiological suggestions for targeted intervention. It seems timely to revisit the value of CRS biomarkers in a pathophysiology-centered approach. We systematically reviewed the literature in CRS, which revealed 53 clinical studies describing the use of 44 biomarkers and 4 proteomic panels. All biomarkers are involved in at least one of the CRS comorbidities. Among the pathways affected, inflammation, aberrant glucose metabolism, neurohormonal activation, and oxidative stress are well described. There is growing evidence that fibrosis may be the "cornerstone" that unifies most of the pathways leading to CRS. Formation of excess fibrous connective tissue antedates CRS in many cases. This review highlights that biomarkers reflecting fibrosis may be of substantial clinical value in the early detection, prognostication, and guiding treatment of CRS. Biomarkers detecting changes in collagen turnover in the extracellular matrix of heart and kidney appear able to depict subclinical changes in the fibrotic remodeling of tissues and constitute a promising approach toward personalized intervention in CRS.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes shows an increasing prevalence in both adults and children. Identification of biomarkers for both youth and adult-onset type 2 diabetes is crucial for development of screening tools or drug targets. In this study, using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR), we identified 22 circulating proteins causally linked to adult type 2 diabetes and 11 proteins with suggestive evidence for association with youth-onset type 2 diabetes. Among these, colocalization analysis further supported a role in type 2 diabetes for C-type mannose receptor 2 (MR odds ratio [OR] 0.85 [95% CI 0.79-0.92] per genetically predicted SD increase in protein level), MANS domain containing 4 (MR OR 0.90 [95% CI 0.88-0.92]), sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta 2 (MR OR 1.10 [95% CI 1.06-1.15]), endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase 1 beta (MR OR 1.09 [95% CI 1.05-1.14]), spermatogenesis-associated protein 20 (MR OR 1.12 [95% CI 1.06-1.18]), haptoglobin (MR OR 0.96 [95% CI 0.94-0.98]), and alpha 1-3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and alpha 1-3-galactosyltransferase (MR OR 1.04 [95% CI 1.03-1.05]). Our findings support a causal role in type 2 diabetes for a set of circulating proteins, which represent promising type 2 diabetes drug targets.

AB  - Background: Newer therapeutic agents for type 2 diabetes mellitus can improve cardiovascular outcomes, but diabetes remains underdiagnosed in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). We sought to identify proteomic markers of undetected dysglycaemia (impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes mellitus) to improve the identification of patients at highest risk for diabetes. Materials and methods: In this prospective cohort, 626 patients without known diabetes underwent oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) during admission for MI. Proximity extension assay was used to measure 81 biomarkers. Multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for risk factors, was used to evaluate the association of biomarkers with dysglycaemia. Subsequently, lasso regression was performed in a 2/3 training set to identify proteomic biomarkers with prognostic value for dysglycaemia, when added to risk factors, fasting plasma glucose, and glycated haemoglobin A1c. Determination of discriminatory ability was performed in a 1/3 test set. Results: In total, 401/626 patients (64.1%) met the criteria for dysglycaemia. Using multivariable logistic regression, cathepsin D had the strongest association with dysglycaemia. Lasso regression selected seven markers, including cathepsin D, that improved prediction of dysglycaemia (area under the receiver operator curve [AUC] 0.848 increased to 0.863). In patients with normal fasting plasma glucose, only cathepsin D was selected (AUC 0.699 increased to 0.704). Conclusions: Newly detected dysglycaemia, including manifest diabetes, is common in patients with acute MI. Cathepsin D improved the prediction of dysglycaemia, which may be helpful in the a priori risk determination of diabetes as a motivation for confirmatory OGTT.

AB  - Single-cell omics technologies that profile genes (genomic and epigenomic) and determine the abundance of mRNA (transcriptomic), protein (proteomic and secretomic), lipids (lipidomic), and extracellular matrix (matrisomic) support the dissection of adipose tissue heterogeneity at unprecedented resolution in a temporally and spatially defined manner. In particular, cell omics technologies may provide innovative biomarkers for the identification of rare specific progenitor cell subpopulations, assess transcriptional and proteomic changes affecting cell proliferation and immunomodulatory potential, and accurately define the lineage hierarchy and differentiation status of progenitor cells. Unraveling adipose tissue complexity may also provide for the precise assessment of a dysfunctional state, which has been associated with cancer, as cancer-associated adipocytes play an important role in shaping the tumor microenvironment supporting tumor progression and metastasis, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The information collected by single-cell omics has relevant implications for regenerative medicine because adipose tissue is an accessible source of multipotent cells; alternative cell-free approaches, including the use of adipose tissue stromal cell-conditioned medium, extracellular vesicles, or decellularized extracellular matrix, are clinically valid options. Subcutaneous white adipose tissue, which is generally harvested via liposuction, is highly heterogeneous because of intrinsic biological variability and extrinsic inconsistencies in the harvesting and processing procedures. The current limited understanding of adipose tissue heterogeneity impinges on the definition of quality standards appropriate for clinical translation, which requires consistency and uniformity of the administered product. We review the methods used for dissecting adipose tissue heterogeneity and provide an overview of advances in omics technology that may contribute to the exploration of heterogeneity and dynamics of adipose tissue at the single-cell level.

AB  - Hypertension (HTN) is increasing in prevalence, and albuminuria is a strong indicator of cardiovascular risk and renal damage progression. Despite blood pressure control with chronic treatment, a relevant subgroup of patients develop albuminuria. However, the biological factors responsible for albuminuria development and progression are underexplored. We aimed to identify key metabolic targets and biological pathways involved in the negative progression of cardiovascular and renal damage in hypertensives undergoing chronic treatment. A series of 1533 patients were followed for 5 years to investigate the evolution of albuminuria. Patients were classified as: (1) patients with persistent normoalbuminuria; (2) patients developing de novo albuminuria; and (3) patients with maintained albuminuria. At the end of follow-up, urine from 30 nonhypertensive subjects (control group) and a representative cohort of 118 patients was collected for metabolomic analysis. Metabolic patterns of interest were identified in a first discovery phase by nuclear magnetic resonance and further confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Metabolites corresponding to HTN or albuminuria were measured in a prospective study carried out in 35 individuals still in normoalbuminuria, to evaluate their potential as predictors of albuminuria development. Nine metabolites were significantly altered, linking beta-alanine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid cycle. The prospective study revealed a panel composed of guanidinoacetate, glutamate, and pantothenate, which was able to predict development of albuminuria. These metabolic signatures open new possibilities in hypertensive therapy and cardiovascular risk control, providing prompt and more efficient intervention, particularly in patients with worse cardiovascular prognosis.

AB  - Age is the single greatest risk factor for a wide range of diseases, and as the mean age of human populations grows steadily older, the impact of this risk factor grows as well. Laboratory studies on the basic biology of ageing have shed light on numerous genetic pathways that have strong effects on lifespan. However, we still do not know the degree to which the pathways that affect ageing in the lab also influence variation in rates of ageing and age-related disease in human populations. Similarly, despite considerable effort, we have yet to identify reliable and reproducible 'biomarkers', which are predictors of one's biological as opposed to chronological age. One challenge lies in the enormous mechanistic distance between genotype and downstream ageing phenotypes. Here, we consider the power of studying 'endophenotypes' in the context of ageing. Endophenotypes are the various molecular domains that exist at intermediate levels of organization between the genotype and phenotype. We focus our attention specifically on proteins and metabolites. Proteomic and metabolomic profiling has the potential to help identify the underlying causal mechanisms that link genotype to phenotype. We present a brief review of proteomics and metabolomics in ageing research with a focus on the potential of a systems biology and network-centric perspective in geroscience. While network analyses to study ageing utilizing proteomics and metabolomics are in their infancy, they may be the powerful model needed to discover underlying biological processes that influence natural variation in ageing, age-related disease, and longevity.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes poses a major challenge to societies worldwide. Blood-based factors like serum proteins are in contact with every organ in the body to mediate global homeostasis and may thus directly regulate complex processes such as aging and the development of common chronic diseases. We applied a data-driven proteomics approach, measuring serum levels of 4,137 proteins in 5,438 elderly Icelanders, and identified 536 proteins associated with prevalent and/or incident type 2 diabetes. We validated a subset of the observed associations in an independent case-control study of type 2 diabetes. These protein associations provide novel biological insights into the molecular mechanisms that are dysregulated prior to and following the onset of type 2 diabetes and can be detected in serum. A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis indicated that serum changes of at least 23 proteins are downstream of the disease or its genetic liability, while 15 proteins were supported as having a causal role in type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Background The overactivation of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) plays a key pathological role in the progression of cardiovascular and renal diseases by promoting pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic signaling. Recently, it has been found that finerenone, a novel nonsteroidal selective MR antagonist, can robustly improve cardiorenal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and a wide spectrum of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the mechanisms underlying the cardiorenal benefits of finerenone are poorly understood. Further, whether the clinical benefits are mediated by an improvement in vascular stiffness is not confirmed. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate the effects of finerenone on vascular stiffness as assessed using cardio ankle vascular index (CAVI) and relevant cardiorenal biomarkers in patients with T2D and CKD.Methods The Effects of Finerenone on Vascular Stiffness and Cardiorenal Biomarkers in Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease (FIVE-STAR) is an ongoing, investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial in Japan. Its target sample size is 100 subjects. Recruitment will be performed from September 2023 to July 2024. After obtaining informed consent, eligible participants with T2D and CKD (25 mL/min/1.73 m(2) & LE; estimated glomerular filtration ratio [eGFR] < 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and 30 mg/g Cr & LE; urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] < 3500 mg/g Cr) will be equally randomized to receive 24-week treatment with either finerenone (starting dose at 10 mg once daily in participants with a baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or at 20 mg once daily in those with a baseline eGFR & GE; 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) or dose-matched placebo. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in CAVI at 24 weeks. The secondary endpoints are changes from baseline in UACR at 12 and 24 weeks and relevant serum and urinary biomarkers at 24 weeks. As an exploratory endpoint, proteomic analysis using the Olink (R) Target 96 panels will be also performed.Discussion FIVE-STAR is the first trial evaluating the therapeutic impact of finerenone on vascular stiffness and relevant cardiorenal biomarkers in patients with T2D and CKD. This study will provide mechanistic insights on the clinical benefits of finerenone based on recent cardiovascular and renal outcome trials.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to identify proteins that contribute to pathophysiology and allow prediction of incident type 2 diabetes or incident prediabetes. We quantified 14 candidate proteins using targeted mass spectrometry in plasma samples of the prospective, population-based German KORA F4/FF4 study (6.5-year follow-up). 892 participants aged 42-81years were selected using a case-cohort design, including 123 persons with incident type 2 diabetes and 255 persons with incident WHO-defined prediabetes. Prospective associations between protein levels and diabetes, prediabetes as well as continuous fasting and 2h glucose, fasting insulin and insulin resistance were investigated using regression models adjusted for established risk factors. The best predictive panel of proteins on top of a non-invasive risk factor model or on top of HbA1c, age, and sex was selected. Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase (MASP) levels were positively associated with both incident type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. Adiponectin was inversely associated with incident type 2 diabetes. MASP, adiponectin, apolipoprotein A-IV, apolipoprotein C-II, C-reactive protein, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase D1 were associated with individual continuous outcomes. The combination of MASP, apolipoprotein E (apoE) and adiponectin improved diabetes prediction on top of both reference models, while prediabetes prediction was improved by MASP plus CRP on top of the HbA1c model. In conclusion, our mass spectrometric approach revealed a novel association of MASP with incident type 2 diabetes and incident prediabetes. In combination, MASP, adiponectin and apoE improved type 2 diabetes prediction beyond non-invasive risk factors or HbA1c, age and sex.

AB  - Tubular injury is one of the important determinants of progressive renal failure in diabetic nephropathy (DN), and TGF-beta 1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial disease that characterizes proteinuric renal disease. The aim of this study was to identify novel therapeutic target molecules that play a role in the tubule damage of DN. We used an LC-MS/MS-based proteomic technique and human renal proximal epithelial cells (HRPTECs). Urine samples from Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 46) were used to quantify the candidate protein. Several proteins in HRPTECs in cultured media were observed to be driven by TGF-beta 1, one of which was 33-kDa IGFBP7, which is a member of IGFBP family. TGF-beta 1 up-regulated the expressions of IGFBP7 mRNA and protein in a dose-and time-dependent fashion via Smad2 and 4, but not MAPK pathways in HRPTECs. In addition, the knockdown of IGFBP7 restored the TGF-beta 1-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In the immunohistochemical analysis, IGFBP7 was localized to the cytoplasm of tubular cells but not that of glomerular cells in diabetic kidney. Urinary IGFBP7 levels were significantly higher in the patients with macroalbuminuria and were correlated with age (r = 0.308, p = 0.037), eGFR (r = -0.376, p = 0.01), urinary beta(2)-microglobulin (r = 0.385, p = 0.008), and urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) (r = 0.502, p = 0.000). A multivariate regression analysis identified urinary NAG and age as determinants associated with urinary IGFBP7 levels. In conclusion, our data suggest that TGF-beta 1 enhances IGFBP7 via Smad2/4 pathways, and that IGFBP7 might be involved in the TGF-beta 1-induced tubular injury in DN.

AB  - (1) Background: Ceramides are a new kind of lipid biomarker and have already been demonstrated to be valuable risk predictors in coronary patients. Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are a population with a worse prognosis and higher mortality risk compared to coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. However, the value of ceramides for risk prediction in PAD patients is still vague, as addressed in the present study. (2)Methods: This observational study included 379 PAD patients. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 10 years of follow-up. A set of ceramides was measured by LC-MS/MS and combined according to the Coronary Event Risk Test (CERT) score, which categorizes patients into one of four risk groups (low risk, moderate risk, high risk, very high risk). (3) Results: Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that the overall survival of patients decreased with the increasing risk predicted by the four CERT categories, advancing from low risk to very high risk. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that each one-category increase resulted in a 35% rise in overall mortality risk (HR = 1.35 [1.16-1.58]). Multivariable adjustment, including, among others, age, LDL-cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, and statin treatment before the baseline, did not abrogate this significant association (HR = 1.22 [1.04-1.43]). Moreover, we found that the beneficial effect of statin treatment is significantly stronger in patients with a higher risk, according to CERT. (4) Conclusions: We conclude that the ceramide-based risk score CERT is a strong predictor of the 10-year mortality risk in patients with PAD.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a metabolic disorder that arises from the increasing prevalence of obesity. The pathophysiology seems to be largely attributable to the imbalance of lipid and glucose metabolism, redox signaling pathways, and gut microbiota. The increased syndromes, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease demands natural therapeutic attention for those at high risk. Vine tea, as a traditional medicinal and edible resource rich in flavonoids, especially for dihydromyricetin (DHM), exhibits promising health benefits on the intervention of MS, but the specific molecular mechanism has not been systematically elucidated. The present article aims to summarize the regulatory effects and biological targets of vine tea or DHM on MS, and analyze the underlying potential molecular mechanisms in cells, animals, and humans, mainly by regulating the redox associated signaling pathways, such as Nrf2, NF-kappa B, PI3K/IRS2/AKT, AMPK-PGC1 alpha-SIRT1, SIRT3 pathways, and the crosstalk among them, and by targeting several key biomarkers. Moreover, vine tea extract or DHM has a positive impact on the modulation of intestinal microecology by upregulating the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) and increasing the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila. Therefore, this review updated the latest important theoretical basis and molecular evidence for the development and application of vine tea in dietary functional products or drugs against MS and also imputed the future perspectives to clarify the deep mechanism among vine tea or DHM, redox associated signaling pathways, and gut microbiota.

AB  - OBJECTIVE
   The predictive value of microalbuminuria (MAU) for kidney damage is limited in type 2 diabetes (T2D). We studied whether a urine proteome specific for sight-threatening proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an indicator to predict chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) in patients with T2D.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
   A shotgun urine proteomic analysis was performed in patients with MAU and PDR (case subjects) and in patients with MAU and a duration of T2D for > 10 years but without any degree of retinopathy (control subjects). In the cohort study, 210 patients with T2D with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 80 mL/min/1.73m(2) were followed for a median of 5.3 years. Urine proteins specific for PDR were used for predicting CRI (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)).
   RESULTS
   The top two urine proteins with the highest difference in ratio of case subjects to control subjects were haptoglobin (8.7 times; P < 0.0001) and alpha-2-macroglobulin (5.7 times; P < 0.0001). In the cohort study, patients with baseline urinary haptoglobin >= 20 ng/min (haptoglobinuria) had a higher incidence of CRI than those without (hazard ratio [95% CI] 3.27 [1.41-7.58]; P = 0.006). The overall CRI rate was 3.2% for patients without haptoglobinuria or MAU, 9.5% for those with MAU, and 13.3% for those with haptoglobinuria. The highest rate for CRI (22.4%) was in patients with both MAU and haptoglobinuria (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Urine haptoglobin, which is specific for PDR, is a novel biomarker and complement to urine albumin for predicting kidney damage in patients with T2D.

AB  - Purpose Diabetic patients are more likely to experience dry eye (DE). TMT-based proteomics and WGCNA are used to identify the differentially expressed proteins in tear proteome of type 2 diabetes with DE. The aim is to provide a molecular basis for exploring possible mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of diabetic DE. Experimental design Subjects are divided into four groups (ten in each): type 2 diabetes with DE; type 2 diabetes without DE; non-diabetes with DE and normal controls. All subjects undergo DE tests. Total proteins are extracted and quantitatively labeled with TMT, then analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. WGCNA is used to identify the hub genes. Finally, differentially expressed proteins are validated by ELISA. Results A total of 1922 proteins are identified, of which 1814 contain quantitative information. Ultimately, 650 of these proteins yield quantitative values. WGCNA performed on these 650 proteins reveal four distinct hub genes of diabetic DE. Conclusions and clinical relevance DE is associated with the differential expression of tear proteins in type 2 diabetes. Inflammation, immune factors, and lipid metabolism may play a role in the development of diabetic DE. LTF, LYZ, ZAG, and DNAJC3 have the potential to be the biomarkers of DE in diabetes.

AB  - Background: As part of a clinical proteomics program focused on diabetes and its complications we are looking for new and better protein biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy. The search for new and better biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy has, with a few exceptions, previously focused on either hypothesis-driven studies or urinary based investigations. To date only two studies have investigated the proteome of blood in search for new biomarkers, and these studies were conducted in sera from patients with type 2 diabetes. This is the first reported in depth proteomic study where plasma from type 1 diabetic patients was investigated with the goal of finding improved candidate biomarkers to predict diabetic nephropathy. In order to reach lower concentration proteins in plasma a pre-fractionation step, either hexapeptide bead-based libraries or anion exchange chromatography, was performed prior to surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis.
   Results: Proteomic analysis of plasma from a cross-sectional cohort of 123 type 1 diabetic patients previously diagnosed as normoalbuminuric, microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric, gave rise to 290 peaks clusters of which 16 were selected as the most promising biomarker candidates based on statistical performance, including independent component analysis. Four of the peaks that were discovered have been identified as transthyretin, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein C1 and cystatin C. Several yet unidentified proteins discovered by this novel approach appear to have more potential as biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy.
   Conclusion: These results demonstrate the capacity of proteomic analysis of plasma, by confirming the presence of known biomarkers as well as revealing new biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy in plasma in type 1 diabetic patients.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis Multiplex proteomics could improve understanding and risk prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in type 2 diabetes. This study assessed 80 cardiovascular and inflammatory proteins for biomarker discovery and prediction of MACE in type 2 diabetes.
   Methods We combined data from six prospective epidemiological studies of 30-77-year-old individuals with type 2 diabetes in whom 80 circulating proteins were measured by proximity extension assay. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used in a discovery/replication design to identify biomarkers for incident MACE. We used gradient-boosted machine learning and lasso regularised Cox regression in a random 75% training subsample to assess whether adding proteins to risk factors included in the Swedish National Diabetes Register risk model would improve the prediction of MACE in the separate 25% test subsample.
   Results Of 1211 adults with type 2 diabetes (32% women), 211 experienced a MACE over a mean (+/- SD) of 6.4 +/- 2.3 years. We replicated associations (< 5% false discovery rate) between risk of MACE and eight proteins: matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12, IL-27 subunit alpha (IL-27a), kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23, protein S100-A12, TNF receptor (TNFR)-1, TNFR-2 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL-R)2. Addition of the 80-protein assay to established risk factors improved discrimination in the separate test sample from 0.686 (95% CI 0.682, 0.689) to 0.748 (95% CI 0.746, 0.751). A sparse model of 20 added proteins achieved a C statistic of 0.747 (95% CI 0.653, 0.842) in the test sample.
   Conclusions/interpretation We identified eight protein biomarkers, four of which are novel, for risk of MACE in community residents with type 2 diabetes, and found improved risk prediction by combining multiplex proteomics with an established risk model. Multiprotein arrays could be useful in identifying individuals with type 2 diabetes who are at highest risk of a cardiovascular event.

AB  - Blacks are more prone to salt-sensitive hypertension than Whites. This cross-sectional analysis of a multi-ethnic cohort aimed to search for proteins potentially involved in the susceptibility to salt sensitivity, hypertension, and hypertension-related complications. The study included individuals enrolled in African Prospective Study on the Early Detection and Identification of Cardiovascular Disease and Hypertension (African-PREDICT), Flemish Study of the Environment, Genes and Health Outcomes (FLEMENGHO), Prospective Cohort Study in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for Validation of Biomarkers (PROVALID)-Austria, and Urinary Proteomics Combined with Home Blood Pressure Telemonitoring for Health Care Reform Trial (UPRIGHT-HTM). Sequenced urinary peptides detectable in 70% of participants allowed the identification of parental proteins and were compared between Blacks and Whites. Of 513 urinary peptides, 300 had significantly different levels among healthy Black (n = 476) and White (n = 483) South Africans sharing the same environment. Analyses contrasting 582 Blacks versus 1731 Whites, and Sub-Saharan Blacks versus European Whites replicated the findings. COL4A1, COL4A2, FGA, PROC, MGP, MYOCD, FYXD2, and UMOD were identified as the most likely candidates underlying the racially different susceptibility to salt sensitivity, hypertension, and related complications. Enriched pathways included hemostasis, platelet activity, collagens, biology of the extracellular matrix, and protein digestion and absorption. Our study suggests that MGP and MYOCD being involved in cardiovascular function, FGA and PROC in coagulation, FYXD2 and UMOD in salt homeostasis, and COL4A1 and COL4A2 as major components of the glomerular basement membrane are among the many proteins potentially incriminated in the higher susceptibility of Blacks compared to Whites to salt sensitivity, hypertension, and its complication. Nevertheless, these eight proteins and their associated pathways deserve further exploration in molecular and human studies as potential targets for intervention to reduce the excess risk of hypertension and cardiovascular complications in Blacks versus Whites.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis The identification of people who are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes is a key part of population-level prevention strategies. Previous studies have evaluated the predictive utility of omics measurements, such as metabolites, proteins or polygenic scores, but have considered these separately. The improvement that combined omics biomarkers can provide over and above current clinical standard models is unclear. The aim of this study was to test the predictive performance of genome, proteome, metabolome and clinical biomarkers when added to established clinical prediction models for type 2 diabetes.Methods We developed sparse interpretable prediction models in a prospective, nested type 2 diabetes case-cohort study (N=1105, incident type 2 diabetes cases=375) with 10,792 person-years of follow-up, selecting from 5759 features across the genome, proteome, metabolome and clinical biomarkers using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. We compared the predictive performance of omics-derived predictors with a clinical model including the variables from the Cambridge Diabetes Risk Score and HbA(1c).Results Among single omics prediction models that did not include clinical risk factors, the top ten proteins alone achieved the highest performance (concordance index [C index]=0.82 [95% CI 0.75, 0.88]), suggesting the proteome as the most informative single omic layer in the absence of clinical information. However, the largest improvement in prediction of type 2 diabetes incidence over and above the clinical model was achieved by the top ten features across several omic layers (C index=0.87 [95% CI 0.82, 0.92], Delta C index=0.05, p=0.045). This improvement by the top ten omic features was also evident in individuals with HbA(1c) <42 mmol/mol (6.0%), the threshold for prediabetes (C index=0.84 [95% CI 0.77, 0.90], Delta C index=0.07, p=0.03), the group in whom prediction would be most useful since they are not targeted for preventative interventions by current clinical guidelines. In this subgroup, the type 2 diabetes polygenic risk score was the major contributor to the improvement in prediction, and achieved a comparable improvement in performance when added onto the clinical model alone (C index=0.83 [95% CI 0.75, 0.90], Delta C index=0.06, p=0.002). However, compared with those with prediabetes, individuals at high polygenic risk in this group had only around half the absolute risk for type 2 diabetes over a 20 year period.Conclusions/interpretation Omic approaches provided marginal improvements in prediction of incident type 2 diabetes. However, while a polygenic risk score does improve prediction in people with an HbA(1c) in the normoglycaemic range, the group in whom prediction would be most useful, even individuals with a high polygenic burden in that subgroup had a low absolute type 2 diabetes risk. This suggests a limited feasibility of implementing targeted population-based genetic screening for preventative interventions.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis This study aimed to elucidate the aetiological role of plasma proteins in glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes development.Methods We measured 233 proteins at baseline in 1653 participants from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) S4 cohort study (median follow-up time: 13.5 years). We used logistic regression in the cross-sectional analysis (n=1300), and Cox regression accounting for interval-censored data in the longitudinal analysis (n=1143). We further applied two-level growth models to investigate associations with repeatedly measured traits (fasting glucose, 2 h glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-B, HOMA-IR, HbA(1c)), and two-sample Mendelian randomisation analysis to investigate causal associations. Moreover, we built prediction models using priority-Lasso on top of Framingham-Offspring Risk Score components and evaluated the prediction accuracy through AUC.Results We identified 14, 24 and four proteins associated with prevalent prediabetes (i.e. impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose), prevalent newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and incident type 2 diabetes, respectively (28 overlapping proteins). Of these, IL-17D, IL-18 receptor 1, carbonic anhydrase-5A, IL-1 receptor type 2 (IL-1RT2) and matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein were novel candidates. IGF binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and paraoxonase 3 (PON3) were inversely associated while fibroblast growth factor 21 was positively associated with incident type 2 diabetes. LPL was longitudinally linked with change in glucose-related traits, while IGFBP2 and PON3 were linked with changes in both insulin-and glucose-related traits. Mendelian randomisation analysis suggested causal effects of LPL on type 2 diabetes and fasting insulin. The simultaneous addition of 12 priority-Lasso-selected biomarkers (IGFBP2, IL-18, IL-17D, complement component C1q receptor, V-set and immunoglobulin domain-containing protein 2, IL-1RT2, LPL, CUB domain-containing protein 1, vascular endothelial growth factor D, PON3, C-C motif chemokine 4 and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5) significantly improved the predictive performance (?AUC 0.0219; 95% CI 0.0052, 0.0624).Conclusions/interpretation We identified new candidates involved in the development of derangements in glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes and confirmed previously reported proteins. Our findings underscore the importance of proteins in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and the identified putative proteins can function as potential pharmacological targets for diabetes treatment and prevention.

AB  - ObjectiveTo explore differentially expressed miRNAs in type 2 diabetes and their potential cellular functions. MethodsWe screened plasma miRNAs by miRNA array analysis and validated them by TaqMan real-time PCR in 113 newly diagnosed, untreated type 2 diabetes cases and 113 healthy controls. Low-abundance plasma proteins encoded by miR-193b-3p target genes were explored in this study population. We further investigated the potential cellular functions of the differentially expressed miRNAs in HepG2 cells. ResultsmiR-193b-3p was differentially expressed in type 2 diabetes cases compared to healthy controls (fold change = 2.01, P = 0.006). Plasma levels of triosephosphate isomerase (TPI1, a protein involved in the glycolytic pathway) decreased in type 2 diabetes cases (fold change = 1.37, P = 0.002). The effect of miR-193b-3p on TPI1 was verified by transfection of miR-193b-3p into HepG2 cells. miR-193b-3p inhibited the expression of YWHAZ/14-3-3 zeta in the PI3K-AKT pathway, subsequently altering the expression of FOXO1 and PCK1. After transfection, cells were incubated in glucose-free medium for another 4 h. Glucose levels in medium from cells with elevated miR-193b-3p levels were significantly higher than those in medium from negative control cells (P = 0.016). In addition, elevated miR-193b-3p reduced glucose uptake by inhibiting insulin receptor (IR) and GLUT2 expression. ConclusionPlasma miR-193b-3p levels increased in type 2 diabetes cases, and TPI1 levels decreased in both plasma and HepG2 cells with increased miR-193b-3p levels, while extracellular lactate levels did not significantly changed. Moreover, miR-193b-3p may affect glucose metabolism by directly targeting YWHAZ/14-3-3 zeta and upregulating the transcription factor FOXO1 downstream of the PI3K-AKT pathway.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy and it affects 18% of pregnant women worldwide. GDM is considered a high-risk state which may lead to type II diabetes which is associated with an increase in a number of interrelated adverse perinatal outcomes. Given the fact that the progress of a successful pregnancy is dependent on the intricate communication between several biological molecules, identification of the proteomic profile perturbations in women with GDM is expected to help in understanding the disease pathogenesis and also discovery of clinical biomarker(s). In recent years, both gel-free and gel-based proteomics have been extensively investigated for improving maternal and child health. Although there are several reports integrating various aspects of proteomics in pregnancy related diseases such as preeclampsia, extensive Pubmed search shows no review so far on the application of proteomics in gestational diabetes. In this review, we focus on various high-throughput proteomic technologies for the identification of unique biosignatures and biomarkers responsible for the early prediction of GDM. Further, different analytical strategies and biological samples involved in proteomic analysis of this pregnancy-related disease are discussed.

AB  - Objective:Micro and macroalbuminuria are strong risk factors for progression of nephropathy in patients with hypertension or type 2 diabetes. Early detection of progression to micro and macroalbuminuria may facilitate prevention and treatment of renal diseases. We aimed to develop plasma proteomics classifiers to predict the development of micro or macroalbuminuria in hypertension or type 2 diabetes.Methods:Patients with hypertension (n=125) and type 2 diabetes (n=82) were selected for this case-control study from the Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd-stage Disease cohort and the Steno Diabetes Center. Cases transitioned from normo to microalbuminuria, or from micro to macroalbuminuria. Controls, matched for age, sex, and baseline albuminuria stage, did not transition. Follow-up was 3.00.9 years. Plasma proteomics profiles were measured by liquid chromatography-electrospray-trap mass-spectrometry. Classifiers were developed and cross-validated for prediction of transition in albuminuria stage. Improvement in risk prediction was tested on top of a reference model of baseline albuminuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system intervention.Results:In hypertensive patients, the classifier improved risk prediction for transition in albuminuria stage on top of the reference model (C-index from 0.69 to 0.78; P<0.01). In type 2 diabetes, the classifier improved risk prediction for transition from micro to macroalbuminuria (C-index from 0.73 to 0.80; P=0.04). In both diseases, the identified peptides were linked to pathways recognized to contribute to nephropathy, including fibrosis, inflammation, angiogenesis, and mineral metabolism.Conclusions:Plasma proteomics predict the transition in albuminuria stage beyond established renal risk markers in hypertension or type 2 diabetes. External validation is needed to assess reproducibility.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis The DIRECT (Diabetes Research on Patient Stratification) Study is part of a European Union Framework 7 Innovative Medicines Initiative project, a joint undertaking between four industry and 21 academic partners throughout Europe. The Consortium aims to discover and validate biomarkers that: (1) predict the rate of glycaemic deterioration before and after type 2 diabetes onset; (2) predict the response to diabetes therapies; and (3) help stratify type 2 diabetes into clearly definable disease subclasses that can be treated more effectively than without stratification. This paper describes two new prospective cohort studies conducted as part of DIRECT.
   Methods Prediabetic participants (target sample size 2,200-2,700) and patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (target sample size similar to 1,000) are undergoing detailed metabolic phenotyping at baseline and 18 months and 36 months later. Abdominal, pancreatic and liver fat is assessed using MRI. Insulin secretion and action are assessed using frequently sampled OGTTs in non-diabetic participants, and frequently sampled mixed-meal tolerance tests in patients with type 2 diabetes. Biosamples include venous blood, faeces, urine and nail clippings, which, among other biochemical analyses, will be characterised at genetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic and metagenomic levels. Lifestyle is assessed using high-resolution triaxial accelerometry, 24 h diet record, and food habit questionnaires.
   Conclusinos/interpretation DIRECT will yield an unprecedented array of biomaterials and data. This resource, available through managed access to scientists within and outside the Consortium, will facilitate the development of new treatments and therapeutic strategies for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Complex adaptations including changes in cellular redox status, the production of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and alterations in immunity occur as the result of aging of the immune system (immunosenescence). These events are thought to underlie the progression of chronic degenerative diseases of aging, such as atherosclerosis, Type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. It is envisaged that identifying early biomarkers of immune aging would aid in identifying individuals at risk of age-related disease and would allow the discovery of novel intervention strategies. Proteomics has emerged as a rapidly expanding and innovative field, investigating protein expression, interaction and function at a global level. Several proteomic strategies, including use of mass spectrometry and non-mass spectrometry-based detection systems (including secondary antibody labeling with fluorescent tags) may be particularly advantageous in identifying biomarkers of immune health. Application of these approaches may identify factors that both contribute to (and define) age-dependent deregulation of the immune system.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that results from insulin resistance in the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue and relative insulin deficiency. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cellular response to insulin. Recently, ER stress has been known to reduce the insulin sensitivity of the liver and lead to type 2 diabetes. However, detailed mechanisms of ER stress response that leads to type 2 diabetes remains unknown. To obtain a global view of ER function in type 2 diabetic liver and identify proteins that may be responsible for hepatic ER stress and insulin resistance, we performed proteomics analysis of mouse liver ER using nano UPLC-MSE. A total of 1584 proteins were identified in control C57 and type 2 diabetic db/db mice livers. Comparison of the rER and sER proteomes from normal mice showed that proteins involved in protein synthesis and metabolic process were enriched in the rER, while those associated with transport and cellular homeostasis were localized to the sER. In addition, proteins involved in protein folding and ER stress were found only in the rER. In the livers of db/db mice, however, the functions of the rER and sER were severely disrupted, including the capacity to resolve ER stress. These results provide new insight into the research on hepatic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and are suggestive of the potential use of the differentially expressed hepatic ER proteins as biomarkers for hepatic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Objective: Bile acids (BAs) are signaling molecules controlling lipid and glucose metabolism. Since BA alterations are associated with obesity and insulin resistance, plasma BAs have been considered candidates to predict type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. We aimed to determine (1) the association of BAs with glucose homeostasis parameters and (2) their predictive association with the risk of conversion from prediabetes to new-onset diabetes (NOD) in a prospective cohort study.
   Design: 205 patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) were followed each year during 5 years in the IT-DIAB cohort study. Twenty-one BA species and 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a marker of BA synthesis, were quantified by LC/MS-MS in plasma from fasted patients at baseline. Correlations between plasma BA species and metabolic parameters at baseline were assessed by Spearman's coefficients and the association between BAs and NOD was determined using Cox proportional-hazards models.
   Results: Among the analyzed BA species, total hyocholic acid (HCA) and the total HCA/total chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) ratio, reflecting hepatic BA 6 alpha-hydroxylation activity, negatively correlated with BMI and HOMA-IR. The total HCA/total CDCA ratio also correlated negatively with HbA(1C). Conversion from IFG to NOD occurred in 33.7% of the participants during the follow-up. Plasma BA species were not independently associated with the conversion to NOD after adjustment with classical T2D risk factors.
   Conclusions: Fasting plasma BAs are not useful clinical biomarkers for predicting NOD in patients with IFG. However, an unexpected association between 6 alpha-hydroxylated BAs and glucose parameters was found, suggesting a role for this specific BA pathway in metabolic homeostasis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Current diagnostic tests such as glycemic indicators have limitations for early detection of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), which leads to diabetes. Oxidative stress induced by various oxidants in a random and destructive manner is considered to play an important role in the pathophysiology of a number of human disorders and diseases such as impaired glucose tolerance. We have developed an improved method for the measurement of in vivo lipid peroxidation, where the presence of 8-iso-prostaglandin F-2 alpha (8-iso-PGF(2 alpha)), hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and 7-hydroxycholesterol (7-OHCh), as well as their parent molecules, linoleic acid (LA) and cholesterol (Ch), was determined by performing LC-MS/MS (for 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha), HODE, and HETE) and GC-MS (for 7-OHCh, LA, and Ch) after reduction with triphenyl phosphine and saponification by potassium hydroxide. We then applied this method to volunteers (n = 57), including normal type (n = 43), "high-normal'' (fasting plasma glucose, 100-109 mg/dL, n = 7), pre-diabetic type (IGT, n = 5), and diabetic type (n = 2) subjects who are diagnosed by performing oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). Several biomarkers in plasma, such as insulin, leptin, adiponectin, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-a, high sensitivity-C-reactive protein, HbA1c, and glucose levels were measured during OGTT. We found that the fasting levels of (10- and 12-(Z,E)-HODE)/LA increased significantly with increasing levels of HbA1c and glucose during OGTT and with insulin secretion and resistance index. In conclusion, 10-and 12-(Z,E)-HODE may be prominent biomarkers for the early detection of IGT and "high-normal'' type without OGTT.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy occurs in approximately 25% of patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes; the disease can cause poor vision and even blindness because high glucose levels weaken retinal capillaries, causing leakage of blood into surrounding areas. We adopted a proteomics-based approach using 2D-DIGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS to compare the differential plasma proteome between diabetic retinopathy with significant retinopathy occurrence within 5 years after diagnosis of diabetes, and diabetic non-retinopathy without diagnosed retinopathy for more than 10 years after diagnosis of diabetes. We identified 77 plasma proteins, which represent 28 unique gene products. These proteins mainly have inflammatory response and coagulation roles. Our approach identified several potential diabetic retinopathy biomarkers including afamin and the protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5, which may be associated with the progression and development of diabetes. In conclusion, we report a comprehensive patient-based plasma proteomic approach to the identification of potential plasma biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy screening and detection.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis Individuals at a high risk of type 2 diabetes demonstrate moderate impairments in glucose metabolism years before the clinical manifestation of type 2 diabetes, a state called 'prediabetes'. In order to elucidate the pathophysiological processes leading to type 2 diabetes, we aimed to identify protein biomarkers associated with prediabetes.
   Methods In a proteomics study, we used targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM)-MS to quantify 23 candidate proteins in the plasma of 439 randomly selected men and women aged 47-76 years from the population-based German KORA F4 study. Cross-sectional associations of protein levels with prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance), type 2 diabetes, glucose levels in both the fasting state and 2 h after an OGTT, fasting insulin and insulin resistance were investigated using regression models adjusted for technical covariables, age, sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol intake, physical inactivity, actual hypertension, triacylglycerol levels, total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels.
   Results Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase 1 (MASP1; OR per SD 1.77 [95% CI 1.26, 2.47]), thrombospondin 1 (THBS1; OR per SD 1.55 [95% CI 1.16, 2.07]) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D1 (GPLD1; OR per SD 1.40 [95% CI 1.01, 1.94]) were positively associated with prediabetes, and apolipoprotein A-IV (ApoA-IV; OR per SD 0.75 [95% CI 0.56, 1.00]) was inversely associated with prediabetes. MASP1 was positively associated with fasting and 2 h glucose levels. ApoA-IV was inversely and THBS1 was positively associated with 2 h glucose levels. MASP1 associations with prediabetes and fasting glucose resisted Bonferroni correction. Type 2 diabetes associations were partly influenced by glucose-lowering medication.
   Conclusions/interpretation We discovered novel and independent associations of prediabetes and related traits with MASP1, and some evidence for associations with THBS1, GPLD1 and ApoA-IV, suggesting a role for these proteins in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Rationale: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the epigenetic regulation of key metabolic, inflammatory, and antiangiogenic pathways in type 2 diabetes (DM) and may contribute to common disease complications.
   Objective: In this study, we explore plasma miRNA profiles in patients with DM.
   Methods and Results: Total RNA was extracted from plasma samples of the prospective population-based Bruneck study. A total of 13 candidate miRNAs identified by microarray screening and miRNA network inference were quantified by quantitative PCR in all diabetic patients of the Bruneck study and age-and sex-matched controls (1995 evaluation, n=80 each). Quantitative PCR assessment revealed lower plasma levels of miR-20b, miR-21, miR-24, miR-15a, miR-126, miR-191, miR-197, miR-223, miR-320, and miR-486 in prevalent DM, but a modest increase of miR-28-3p. Findings emerged as robust in multivariable analysis and were independent of the standardization procedure applied. For endothelial miR-126, results were confirmed in the entire Bruneck cohort (n=822) in univariate (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.38 [0.26 to 0.55]; P=2.72x10(-7)) and multivariate analyses (0.57 [0.37 to 0.86]; P=0.0082). Importantly, reduced miR-15a, miR-29b, miR-126, miR-223, and elevated miR-28-3p levels antedated the manifestation of disease. Most differences in miRNA levels were replicated in plasma obtained from hyperglycemic Lep(ob) mice. High glucose concentrations reduced the miR-126 content of endothelial apoptotic bodies. Similarly in patients with DM, the reduction of miR-126 was confined to circulating vesicles in plasma.
   Conclusions: We reveal a plasma miRNA signature for DM that includes loss of endothelial miR-126. These findings might explain the impaired peripheral angiogenic signaling in patients with DM. (Circ Res. 2010;107:810-817.)

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes and 80% of diabetes mellitus (DM) patients whose DM duration is over 10 years can be expected to suffer with DR The diagnosis of DR depends on an ophthalmological examination, and no molecular methods of screening DR status exist. Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) is the early DR which is hard to be noticed in early NPDR, showing significant cause of adult blindness in type 2 diabetes patients. Protein biomarkers have been valuable in the diagnosis of disease and the use of multiple biomarkers has been suggested to overcome the low specificity of single ones. For biomarker development, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) has been spotlighted as an alternative method to quantify target proteins with no need for immunoassay. In this study, 54 candidate DR marker proteins from a previous study were verified by MRM in plasma samples from NPDR patients in 3 stages (mild, moderate and severe; 15 cases each) and diabetic patients without retinopathy (15 cases) as a control. Notably, 27 candidate markers distinguished moderate NPDR from type 2 diabetic patients with no diabetic retinopathy, generating AUC values (>0.7). Specifically, 28 candidate proteins underwent changes in expression as type 2 diabetic patients with no diabetic retinopathy progressed to mild and moderate NPDR Further, a combination of 4 markers from these 28 candidates had the improved specificity in distinguishing moderate NPDR from type 2 diabetic patients with no diabetic retinopathy, yielding a merged AUC value of nearly 1.0. We concluded that MRM is a fast, robust approach of multimarker panel determination and an assay platform that provides improved specificity compared with single biomarker assay systems.

AB  - Introduction: Hypoglycemia has been associated with cardiovascular events, and glucose variability has been suggested to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effect on proteomic cardiovascular risk protein markers of (i) mild iatrogenic hypoglycemia and (ii) severe iatrogenic hypoglycemia followed by rebound hyperglycemia. Methods: Two iatrogenic hypoglycemia studies were compared; firstly, mild hypoglycemia in 18 subjects (10 type 2 diabetes (T2D), 8 controls; blood glucose to 2.8 mmoL/L (50 mg/dL) for 1 h), and secondly, severe hypoglycemia in 46 subjects (23 T2D, 23 controls; blood glucose to <2.2 mmoL/L (<40 mg/dL) transiently followed by intravenous glucose reversal giving rebound hyperglycemia). A SOMAscan assay was used to measure 54 of the 92 cardiovascular protein biomarkers that reflect biomarkers involved in inflammation, cellular metabolic processes, cell adhesion, and immune response and complement activation. Results: Baseline to euglycemia showed no change in any of the proteins measured in the T2D cohort. With severe hypoglycemia, the study controls showed an increase in Angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1) (p < 0.01) and Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) (p < 0.01), but no changes were seen with mild hypoglycemia. In both the mild and severe hypoglycemia studies, at the point of hypoglycemia, T2D subjects showed suppression of Brother of CDO (BOC) (p < 0.01). At 1 h post-hypoglycemia, the changes in ANGPT1, DKK1, and BOC had resolved, with no additional protein biomarker changes despite rebound hyperglycemia from 1.8 +/- 0.1 to 12.2 +/- 2.0 mmol/L. Conclusions: Proteomic biomarkers of cardiovascular disease showed changes at hypoglycemia that resolved within 1 h following the hypoglycemic event and with no changes following hyperglycemia rebound, suggesting that any cardiovascular risk increase is due to the hypoglycemia and not due to glucose fluctuation per se.

AB  - Aims dl-PHPB (potassium 2-(1-hydroxypentyl)-benzoate) has been shown to have neuroprotective effects against acute cerebral ischemia, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dl-PHPB on memory deficits and preliminarily explore the underlying molecular mechanism. Methods Blood glucose and behavioral performance were evaluated in the KK-A(y) diabetic mouse model before and after dl-PHPB administration. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)-based proteomics was used to identify differentially expressed proteins in brain tissue. Western blotting was used to study the molecular mechanism of the related signaling pathways. Results Three-month-old KK-A(y) mice were given 150 mg/kg dl-PHPB by oral gavage for 2 months, which produced no effect on the level of serum glucose. In the Morris water maze test, KK-A(y) mice treated with dl-PHPB showed significant improvements in spatial learning and memory deficits compared with vehicle-treated KK-A(y) mice. Additionally, we performed 2D-DIGE to compare brain proteomes of 5-month KK-A(y) mice treated with and without dl-PHPB. We found 14 altered proteins in the cortex and 11 in the hippocampus; two of the 25 altered proteins and another four proteins that were identified in a previous study on KK-A(y) mice were then validated by western blot to further confirm whether dl-PHPB can reverse the expression levels of these proteins. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta) signaling pathway was also changed in KK-A(y) mice and dl-PHPB treatment could reverse it. Conclusions These results indicate that dl-PHPB may play a potential role in diabetes-associated cognitive impairment through PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta signaling pathway and the differentially expressed proteins may become putative therapeutic targets.

AB  - Since oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most important causes of death worldwide, the prevention and early detection plays a crucial role. Recent epidemiological studies have incriminated diabetes as a risk factor for the development of OSCC, as well as oral premalignant lesions. As for the last 20 years diabetes and oral squamous cell carcinoma rates have been increasing rapidly, therefore a reliable detection method of major saliva proteins as possible biomarkers for OSCC is of key priority. In this study we collected whole saliva samples from patients with diabetes and from healthy subjects. To reduce the risk of failure and to keep the investigation good reproducible, we proposed an examination and saliva collecting technique. The proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Our findings show that the expression of Annexin A8, Peroxiredoxin-2 and Tyrosine kinase is elevated by patients having diabetes. All these proteins have been previously described in cancer saliva samples also in OSCC. Our current findings showed that testing saliva may be an effective and reliable method for detecting oral cancer in early stages.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis Using a targeted proteomics approach, we aimed to identify and validate circulating proteins associated with impaired glucose metabolism (IGM) and type 2 diabetes in a Black South African cohort. In addition, we assessed sex-specific associations between the validated proteins and pathophysiological pathways of type 2 diabetes. Methods This cross-sectional study included Black South African men (n=380) and women (n=375) who were part of the Middle- Aged Soweto Cohort (MASC). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to determine fat mass and visceral adipose tissue, and fasting venous blood samples were collected for analysis of glucose, insulin and C-peptide and for targeted proteomics, measuring a total of 184 pre-selected protein biomarkers. An OGTT was performed on participants without diabetes, and peripheral insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), HOMA-IR, basal insulin clearance, insulin secretion (C-peptide index) and beta cell function (disposition index) were estimated. Participants were classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n=546), IGM (n=116) or type 2 diabetes (n= 93). Proteins associated with dysglycaemia (IGM or type 2 diabetes) in the MASC were validated in the Swedish EpiHealth cohort (NGT, n=1706; impaired fasting glucose, n=550; type 2 diabetes, n=210). Results We identified 73 proteins associated with dysglycaemia in the MASC, of which 34 were validated in the EpiHealth cohort. Among these validated proteins, 11 were associated with various measures of insulin dynamics, with the largest number of proteins being associated with HOMA-IR. In sex-specific analyses, IGF-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) was associated with lower HOMA-IR in women (coefficient -0.35; 95% CI -0.44, -0.25) and men (coefficient -0.09; 95% CI -0.15, -0.03). Metalloproteinase inhibitor 4 (TIMP4) was associated with higher insulin secretion (coefficient 0.05; 95% CI 0.001, 0.11; p for interaction=0.025) and beta cell function (coefficient 0.06; 95% CI 0.02, 0.09; p for interaction=0.013) in women only. In contrast, a stronger positive association between IGFBP2 and insulin sensitivity determined using an OGTT (coefficient 0.38; 95% CI 0.27, 0.49) was observed in men (p for interaction=0.004). A posteriori analysis showed that the associations between TIMP4 and insulin dynamics were not mediated by adiposity. In contrast, most of the associations between IGFBP2 and insulin dynamics, except for insulin secretion, were mediated by either fat mass index or visceral adipose tissue in men and women. Fat mass index was the strongest mediator between IGFBP2 and insulin sensitivity (total effect mediated 40.7%; 95% CI 37.0, 43.6) and IGFBP2 and HOMA-IR (total effect mediated 39.1%; 95% CI 31.1, 43.5) in men. Conclusions/interpretation We validated 34 proteins that were associated with type 2 diabetes, of which 11 were associated with measures of type 2 diabetes pathophysiology such as peripheral insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. This study highlights biomarkers that are similar between cohorts of different ancestry, with different lifestyles and sociodemographic profiles. The African-specific biomarkers identified require validation in African cohorts to identify risk markers and increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in African populations.

AB  - Diabet. Med. 29, 945949 (2012) Abstract Objective A substantial proportion of diabetic nephropathy individuals are non-albuminuric. Using a proteomic approach, we searched for novel urinary biomarkers. Methods We studied three groups (n = 6 per group) of males with Type 2 diabetes: (1) normal renal function; (2) classical diabetic nephropathy (urinary albumincreatinine ratio > 1000 mg/g and glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min.1.73 m2) and (3) non-albuminuric diabetic nephropathy (glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min.1.73 m2 and urinary albumincreatinine ratio < 30 mg/g). We used two-dimensional fluorescence differential gel electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry peptide identification and western blot validation in the study. Results Sixty protein spots were differentially abundant between the non-albuminuric and macro-albuminuric subjects (> 2.5-fold, P < 0.05). In the non-albuminuric subjects, in addition to previously reported a1-microglobulin, the next most interesting spot (upregulated 3.44-fold, P = 0.0026) was human zinc-a2-glycoprotein, a novel adipose-cytokine associated with glomerular injury. This was confirmed by western blot and replicated in female diabetic nephropathy subjects. Conclusions From our preliminary results, human zinc-a2-glycoprotein may be a novel urinary biomarker for non-albuminuric diabetic nephropathy.

AB  - Background
   Nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) play pathophysiological roles in metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this study, we analyzed the fasting NEFA profiles of normoglycemic individuals at risk for T2D (women with a recent history of gestational diabetes (GDM)) in comparison to controls (women after a normoglycemic pregnancy). We also examined the associations of NEFA species with overweight/obesity, body fat distribution and insulin sensitivity.
   Subjects and Methods
   Using LC-MS/MS, we analyzed 41 NEFA species in the fasting sera of 111 women (62 post-GDM, 49 controls). Clinical characterization included a five-point oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), biomarkers and anthropometrics, magnetic resonance imaging (n = 62) and a food frequency questionnaire. Nonparametric tests with Bonferroni correction, binary logistic regression analyses and rank correlations were used for statistical analysis.
   Results
   Women after GDM had a lower molar percentage of total saturated fatty acids (SFA; 38.55% vs. 40.32%, p = 0.0002) than controls. At an explorative level of significance several NEFA species were associated with post-GDM status (with and without adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and HbA1c): The molar percentages of 14: 0, 16: 0, 18: 0 and 18: 4 were reduced, whereas those of 18: 1, 18: 2, 20: 2, 24: 4, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and total n-6 NEFA were increased. BMI and the amount of body fat correlated inversely with several SFA and MUFA and positively with various PUFA species over the whole study cohort (abs(rho)>= 0.3 for all). 14: 0 was inversely and BMI-independently associated with abdominal visceral adiposity. We saw no correlations of NEFA species with insulin sensitivity and the total NEFA concentration was similar in the post-GDM and the control group.
   Conclusion
   In conclusion, we found alterations in the fasting NEFA profile associated with a recent history of gestational diabetes, a risk marker for T2D. NEFA composition also varied with overweight/obesity and with body fat distribution, but not with insulin sensitivity.

AB  - 3-Chloro-1,2-propanediol (3-MCPD) and 2-chloro-1,3-propanediol (2-MCPD) are heat-induced food contaminants being present either as free substances or as fatty acid esters in numerous foods. 3-MCPD was classified to be possibly carcinogenic to humans (category 2B) with kidney and testis being the primary target organs according to animal studies. A previous 28-day oral feeding study with rats revealed that the endogenous antioxidant protein DJ-1 was strongly deregulated at the protein level in kidney, liver, and testis of the experimental animals that had been treated either with 3-MCPD, 2-MCPD or their dipalmitate esters. Here we show that this deregulation is due to the oxidation of a conserved, redox-active cysteine residue (Cys106) of DJ-1 to a cysteine sulfonic acid which is equivalent to loss of function of DJ-1. Irreversible oxidation of DJ-1 is associated with a number of oxidative stress-related diseases such as Parkinson, cancer, and type II diabetes. It is assumed that 3-MCPD or 2-MCPD do not directly oxidize DJ-1, but that these substances induce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which in turn trigger DJ-1 oxidation. The implications of 3-MCPD/2-MCPD-mediated ROS formation in vivo for the ongoing risk assessment of these compounds as well as the potential of oxidized DJ-1 to serve as a novel effect biomarker for 3-MCPD/2-MCPD toxicity are being discussed.

AB  - Background Identification of those at risk of more severe psoriasis and/or associated morbidities offers opportunity for early intervention, reduced disease burden and more cost-effective healthcare. Prognostic biomarkers of disease progression have thus been the focus of intense research, but none are part of routine practice. Objectives To identify and catalogue candidate biomarkers of disease progression in psoriasis for the translational research community.
   Methods A systematic search of CENTRAL, Embase, LILACS and MEDLINE was performed for relevant articles published between 1990 and December 2021. Eligibility criteria were studies involving patients with psoriasis (any age, n >= 50) reporting biomarkers associated with disease progression. The main outcomes were any measure of skin severity or any prespecified psoriasis comorbidity. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second; studies meeting minimal quality criteria (longitudinal design and/or use of methods to control for confounding) were formally assessed for bias. Candidate biomarkers were identified by an expert multistakeholder group using a majority voting consensus exercise, and mapped to relevant cellular and molecular pathways.
   Results Of 181 included studies, most investigated genomic or proteomic biomarkers associated with disease severity (n = 145) or psoriatic arthritis (n = 30). Methodological and reporting limitations compromised interpretation of findings, most notably a lack of longitudinal studies, and inadequate control for key prognostic factors. The following candidate biomarkers with future potential utility were identified for predicting disease severity: LCE3D, interleukin (IL)23R, IL23A, NFKBIL1 loci, HLA-C*06:02 (genomic), IL-17A, IgG aHDL, GlycA, I-FABP and kallikrein 8 (proteomic), tyramine (metabolomic); psoriatic arthritis: HLA-C*06:02, HLA-B*27, HLA-B*38, HLA-B*08, and variation at the IL23R and IL13 loci (genomic); IL-17A, CXCL10, Mac-2 binding protein, integrin b5, matrix metalloproteinase-3 and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (proteomic) and tyramine and mucic acid (metabolomic); and type 2 diabetes mellitus: variation in IL12B and IL23R loci (genomic). No biomarkers were supported by sufficient evidence for clinical use without further validation.
   Conclusions This review provides a comprehensive catalogue of investigated biomarkers of disease progression in psoriasis. Future studies must address the common methodological limitations identified herein to expedite discovery and validation of biomarkers for clinical use.

AB  - Diabetic liver injury is a complication of diabetes without any specific medicine approved for its effective treatment or prevention. In this research, the effect of camel whey protein (CWP) on diabetic liver injury in T2DM rats (T2DM induced by a high-fat diet) and streptozotocin along with its possible mechanism were investigated by means of transcriptome and proteomics. The results demonstrated that CWP lowered fasting blood glucose and improved abnormal blood lipid profiles in T2DM rats. CWP reduced lipid accumulation, diminished oxidative stress, and effectively improved the pathological changes in the liver of T2DM rats. Further experiments indicated that CWP intake had adjusted mitochondrial dysfunction in the livers of T2DM rats and L -O2 cells induced by high glucose (HG)/palmitic acid (PA) by inhibiting alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semi-aldehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) expression. In conclusion, CWP can ameliorate diabetic liver injury in T2DM rats by inhibiting the expression of ACMSD, promote de novo NAD+ synthesis and enhance mitochondrial function.

AB  - In an attempt to discover novel biomarker proteins in type 2 diabetes prognosis, we investigated the influence of hypoglycemic extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) obtained from the macrofungus Tremella fuciformis on the differential levels of plasma proteins in ob/ob mice using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The 2-DE analysis demonstrated that 92 spots from about 900 visualized spots were differentially regulated, of which 40 spots were identified as principal diabetes-associated proteins. By comparing control with EPS-fed mice, we found that at least six proteins were significantly altered in ob/ob mice, including Apo A-I, IV, C-III, E, retinol-binding protein 4, and transferrin, and their levels were interestingly normalized after EPS treatment. Western blot analysis revealed that the altered levels of the two regulatory molecules highlighted in diabetes and obesity (e.g., resistin and adiponectin) were also normalized in response to EPS. The Mouse Diabetes PCR Array profiles showed that the expression of 84 genes related to the onset, development, and progression of diabetes were significantly downregulated in liver, adipocyte, and muscle of ob/ob mice. EPS might act as a potent regulator of gene expression for a wide variety of genes in ob/ob mice. particularly in obesity, insulin resistance, and complications from diabetes mellitus.

AB  - The incidence and mortality of endometrial cancer (EC) have increased in recent years. There is mounting evidence that diabetes may play a role in the greater incidence of EC. The molecular mechanisms of the interaction between type 2 diabetes and EC are not yet clearly understood yet. The present study was undertaken to investigate the plasma proteomics of EC patients with diabetes in comparison to those of EC patients without diabetes. Plasma samples were obtained from age-matched patients (EC diabetic and EC nondiabetic). Untargeted proteomic analysis was carried out using a two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Of the 33 proteins identified, which significantly differed in the plasma abundance between groups, 17 were upregulated and 16 were downregulated. The majority of the altered proteins are involved in the acute phase reaction, cholesterol metabolism, scavenging of heme from plasma, and plasma lipoprotein assembly and mobilization. alpha-2-macroglobulin, Ras association domain-containing protein 3, apolipoprotein A-I, alpha-1B-glycoprotein, and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein were significantly upregulated. The significantly downregulated proteins included haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A-IV, hemopexin, and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin. The differential expression of proteins found in patients who had EC and diabetes indicated severe disease and a poor prognosis. The protein interaction analysis showed dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism and heme scavenging pathways in these patients.

AB  - Diabetic kidney disease occurs in similar to 25-40% of patients with type 2 diabetes. Given the high risk of progressive renal function loss and end-stage renal disease, early identification of patients with a renal risk is important. Novel biomarkers may aid in improving renal risk stratification. In this review, we first focus on the classical panel of albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate as the primary clinical predictors of renal disease and then move our attention to novel biomarkers, primarily concentrating on assay-based multiple/panel biomarkers, proteomics biomarkers and metabolomics biomarkers. We focus on multiple biomarker panels since the molecular processes of renal disease progression in type 2 diabetes are heterogeneous, rendering it unlikely that a single biomarker significantly adds to clinical risk prediction. A limited number of prospective studies of multiple biomarkers address the predictive performance of novel biomarker panels in addition to the classical panel in type 2 diabetes. However, the prospective studies conducted so far have small sample sizes, are insufficiently powered and lack external validation. Adequately sized validation studies of multiple biomarker panels are thus required. There is also a paucity of studies that assess the effect of treatments on novel biomarker panels and determine whether initial treatment-induced changes in novel biomarkers predict changes in long-term renal outcomes. Such studies can not only improve our healthcare but also our understanding of the mechanisms of actions of existing and novel drugs and may yield biomarkers that can be used to monitor drug response. We conclude that this will be an area to focus research on in the future.

AB  - The incidence of diabetes mellitus is growing rapidly, with an increasing disease related morbidity and mortality. This is caused by macro- and microvascular complications, as a consequence of the often late diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but especially by the difficulties to control glucose homeostasis due to the progressive nature of the disease. T2D is moreover a dual disease, with components of beta-cell failure and components of insulin resistance in peripheral organs, such as liver, fat, and muscle. Understanding the pathogenesis of the disease by gaining insight into the molecular pathways involved in both phenomena is one of the major assets of proteomic approaches. Moreover, proteomics and peptidomics may provide us with robust biomarkers for beta-cell failure, insulin resistance in pheripheral organs, but also for the development of diabetic complications. This review focuses on the knowledge gained by use of proteomic and peptidomic techniques in the study of the pathophysiology of T2D and in the attempts to discover new therapeutic targets.

AB  - Purpose of the Review Proteins are the central layer of information transfer from genome to phenome and represent the largest class of drug targets. We review recent advances in high-throughput technologies that provide comprehensive, scalable profiling of the plasma proteome with the potential to improve prediction and mechanistic understanding of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Recent Findings Technological and analytical advancements have enabled identification of novel protein biomarkers and signatures that help to address challenges of existing approaches to predict and screen for T2D. Genetic studies have so far revealed putative causal roles for only few of the proteins that have been linked to T2D, but ongoing large-scale genetic studies of the plasma proteome will help to address this and increase our understanding of aetiological pathways and mechanisms leading to diabetes. Studies of the human plasma proteome have started to elucidate its potential for T2D prediction and biomarker discovery. Future studies integrating genomic and proteomic data will provide opportunities to prioritise drug targets and identify pathways linking genetic predisposition to T2D development.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes is an expensive public health problem threatening society at many levels. Despite many advances in classification of diabetes, we're still in early stages of developing an etio-pathologic ontology of diabetes. Recognizing the various biologic and social determinants of disease outcomes, precision medicine applies to medical interventions as well as psychosocial measures, nutrition, and exercise that may also affect individuals differently. Using this highly personalized approach, one hopes to achieve cost-effective care. The striking evolution in generating "Big Data," Biomarker Fingerprints, and the Internet of Things will force all clinicians to be familiar with the terminology and understand the clinical relevance.

AB  - Previous studies have established the association of sex with gene and protein expression. This study investigated the association of sex with the abundance of endogenous urinary peptides, using capillary electrophoresis-coupled to mass spectrometry (CE-MS) datasets from 2008 healthy individuals and patients with type II diabetes, divided in one discovery and two validation cohorts. Statistical analysis using the Mann-Whitney test, adjusted for multiple testing, revealed 143 sex-associated peptides in the discovery cohort. Of these, 90 peptides were associated with sex in at least one of the validation cohorts and showed agreement in their regulation trends across all cohorts. The 90 sex-associated peptides were fragments of 29 parental proteins. Comparison with previously published transcriptomics data demonstrated that the genes encoding 16 of these parental proteins had sex-biased expression. The 143 sex-associated peptides were combined into a support vector machine-based classifier that could discriminate males from females in two independent sets of healthy individuals and patients with type II diabetes, with an AUC of 89% and 81%, respectively. Collectively, the urinary peptidome contains multiple sex-associated differences, which may enable a better understanding of sex-biased molecular mechanisms and the development of more accurate diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive classifiers for each individual sex.

AB  - Background: Type 2 diabetes patients (DP) have significantly higher plasma levels of valine, leucine, isoleucine and alanine than the controls. Specific amino acids may acutely and chronically regulate insulin secretion from the pancreatic p-cells. We recently identified a metabolic signature of N-acetyl leucine (Ac-Leu) that strongly predicts diabetes development in mice hair. The Ac-Leu appears to be a potential biomarker candidate related to diabetes. However, the determination of Ac-Leu in human hair has not been reported. We measured the Ac-Leu, and its structure is similar to N-acetyl isoleucine (Ac-Ile) in human hair by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). The developed method was applied to the determination of Ac-Leu and Ac-Ile in the hair of healthy volunteers (HV) and DP.
   Methods: Ac-Leu, Ac-Ile and N-acetyl norleucine (Ac-Nle, IS) were extracted from human hair samples by a micropulverized extraction procedure, then separated on a C18 column by isocratic elution of acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid in water:0.1% formic acid (14:86, vol./vol.). MRM using the fragmentation transitions of m/z 174.1 -> 86.1 in the positive ESI mode was performed to quantify the N-acetyl leucine, N-acetyl isoleucine and IS.
   Results: Ac-Leu, Ac-Ile and Ac-Nle in the human hair samples were completely separated by isocratic elution of a 5.0 mm duration wash program using a reversed-phase column, and sensitively detected by LC-MS/MS in the ESI MRM mode. The amounts of Ac-Leu and Ac-Ile in the hairs of HV and DP were determined. When comparing the concentrations between DP and those from HV, a statistically significant correlation was observed for the AcLeu (p < 0.001) and Ac-Ile (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: The proposed method is useful for the determination of Ac-Leu and Ac-Ile in the hairs of DP and HV. Human hair may serve as a noninvasive biosample for the diagnosis of diabetes. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A decline in beta-cell function is a prerequisite for the development of type 2 diabetes, yet the level of beta-cell function in individuals at risk of the condition is rarely measured. This is due, in part, to the fact that current methods for assessing beta-cell function are inaccurate, prone to error, labor-intensive, or affected by glucose-lowering therapy. The aim of the current study was to identify novel circulating biomarkers to monitor beta-cell function and to identify individuals at high risk of developing beta-cell dysfunction. In a nested case-control study from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) cohort (n = 1157), proteomics and miRNA profiling were performed on fasting plasma samples from 43 individuals who progressed to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 43 controls who maintained normal glucose tolerance (NGT) over three years. Groups were matched at baseline for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), insulin sensitivity (euglycemic clamp) and beta-cell glucose sensitivity (mathematical modeling). Proteomic profiling was performed using the SomaLogic platform (Colorado, USA); miRNA expression was performed using a modified RT-PCR protocol (Regulus Therapeutics, California, USA). Results showed differentially expressed proteins and miRNAs including some with known links to type 2 diabetes, such as adiponectin, but also novel biomarkers and pathways. In cross sectional analysis at year 3, the top differentially expressed biomarkers in people with IGT/reduced beta-cell glucose sensitivity were adiponectin, alpha1-antitrypsin (known to regulate adiponectin levels), endocan, miR-181a, miR-342, and miR-323. At baseline, adiponectin, cathepsin D and NCAM.L1 (proteins expressed by pancreatic beta-cells) were significantly lower in those that progressed to IGT. Many of the novel prognostic biomarker candidates were within the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway: for example, Noggin, DLL4 and miR-181a. Further validation studies are required in additional clinical cohorts and in patients with type 2 diabetes, but these results identify novel pathways and biomarkers that may have utility in monitoring beta-cell function and/or predicting future decline, allowing more targeted efforts to prevent and intercept type 2 diabetes.

AB  - The escalating prevalence of metabolic disorders, notably type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, presents a critical global health challenge, necessitating deeper insights into their molecular underpinnings. Our study integrates proteomics and metabolomics analyses to delineate the complex molecular landscapes associated with T2D and obesity. Leveraging data from 130 subjects, including individuals with T2D and obesity as well as healthy controls, we elucidate distinct molecular signatures and identify novel biomarkers indicative of disease progression. Our comprehensive characterization of cardiometabolic proteins and serum metabolites unveils intricate networks of biomolecular interactions and highlights differential protein expression patterns between T2D and obesity cohorts. Pathway enrichment analyses reveal unique mechanisms underlying disease development and progression, while correlation analyses elucidate the interplay between proteomics, metabolomics, and clinical parameters.

AB  - Understanding early determinants of type 2 diabetes is essential for refining disease prevention strategies. Proteomic technology may provide a useful approach to identify novel protein patterns potentially related to pathophysiological changes that lead up to diabetes. In this study, we sought to identify protein signals that are associated with diabetes incidence in a middle-aged population. Serum samples from 519 participants in a nested case-control selection (167 cases and 352 age-, sex- and BMI-matched normoglycemic control subjects, median follow-up 14.0 years) within the Whitehall-II cohort were analyzed by linear matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Nine protein peaks were found to be associated with incident diabetes. Rate ratios for high peak intensity ranged between 0.4 (95% CI, 0.2-0.8) and 4.0 (95% CI, 1.7-9.2) and were robust to adjustment for main potential confounders, including obesity, lipids and C-reactive protein. The proteins associated with these peaks may reflect diabetes pathogenesis. Our study exemplifies the utility of an approach that combines proteomic and epidemiological data.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Elevated glycolytic enzymes in renal glomeruli correlated with preservation of renal function in the Medalist Study, individuals with >= 50 years of type 1 diabetes. Specifically, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) activation protected insulin-deficient diabetic mice from hyperglycemia-induced glomerular pathology. This study aims to extend these findings in a separate cohort of individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and discover new circulatory biomarkers for renal protection through proteomics and metabolomics of Medalists' plasma. We hypothesize that increased glycolytic flux and improved mitochondrial biogenesis will halt the progression of diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Immunoblots analyzed selected glycolytic and mitochondrial enzymes in postmortem glomeruli of non-Medalists with type 1 diabetes (n = 15), type 2 diabetes (n = 19), and no diabetes (n = 5). Plasma proteomic (SOMAscan) (n = 180) and metabolomic screens (n = 214) of Medalists with and without stage 3b chronic kidney disease (CKD) were conducted and significant markers validated by ELISA. RESULTS Glycolytic (PKM1, PKM2, and ENO1) and mitochondrial (MTCO2) enzymes were significantly elevated in glomeruli of CKD- versus CKD+ individuals with type 2 diabetes. Medalists' plasma PKM2 correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (r(2) = 0.077; P = 0.0002). Several glucose and mitochondrial enzymes in circulation were upregulated with corresponding downregulation of toxic metabolites in CKD-protected Medalists. Amyloid precursor protein was also significantly upregulated, tumor necrosis factor receptors downregulated, and both confirmed by ELISA. CONCLUSIONS Elevation of enzymes involved in the metabolism of intracellular free glucose and its metabolites in renal glomeruli is connected to preserving kidney function in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The renal profile of elevated glycolytic enzymes and reduced toxic glucose metabolites is reflected in the circulation, supporting their use as biomarkers for endogenous renal protective factors in people with diabetes.

AB  - Simonson MS, Tiktin M, Debanne SM, Rahman M, Berger B, Hricik D, Ismail-Beigi F. The renal transcriptome of db/db mice identifies putative urinary biomarker proteins in patients with type 2 diabetes: a pilot study. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 302: F820-F829, 2012. First published December 28, 2011; doi:10.1152/ajprenal.00424.2011.-We sought to identify novel urinary biomarkers of kidney function in type 2 diabetes. We screened the renal transcriptome of db/db and db/m mice for differentially expressed mRNA transcripts that encode secreted proteins with human orthologs. Whether elevated urine levels of the orthologous proteins correlated with diminished glomerular filtration rate was tested in a cross-sectional study of n = 56 patients with type 2 diabetes. We identified 36 putative biomarker genes in db/db kidneys: 31 upregulated and 5 downregulated. Urinary protein levels of six selected candidates (endothelin-1, lipocalin-2, transforming growth factor-beta, growth and differentiation factor-15, interleukin-6, and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1) were elevated in type 2 diabetic patients with subnormal glomerular filtration rate (i.e., <90 ml.min(-1).1.73 m(-2)), independent of microalbuminuria, age, sex, race, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists. In contrast, urinary levels of fibroblast growth factor were not increased. A composite variable of urine albumin and any of the six candidate markers was associated with subnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate more closely than albumin alone. In addition, urinary endothelin-1, growth and differentiation factor-15, and interleukin-6 were associated with a marker of proximal tubule damage, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity. These results suggest that gene expression profiling in diabetic mouse kidney can complement existing proteomic-based approaches for renal biomarker discovery in humans.

TI  - Plasma Proteomic Risk Markers of Incident Type 2 Diabetes Reflect Physiologically Distinct Components of Glucose-Insulin Homeostasis
T2  - DIABETES
AB  - High-throughput proteomics allows researchers to simultaneously explore the roles of thousands of biomarkers in the pathophysiology of diabetes. We conducted proteomic association studies of incident type 2 diabetes and physiologic responses to an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) to identify novel protein contributors to glucose homeostasis and diabetes risk. We tested 4,776 SomaScan proteins measured in relation to 18-year incident diabetes risk in participants from the Cardiovascular Health Study (N = 2,631) and IVGTT-derived measures in participants from the HERITAGE Family Study (N = 752). We characterize 51 proteins that were associated with longitudinal diabetes risk, using their respective 39, 9, and 8 concurrent associations with insulin sensitivity index (S-I), acute insulin response to glucose (AIR(G)), and glucose effectiveness (S-G). Twelve of the 51 diabetes associations appear to be novel, including beta-glucuronidase, which was associated with increased diabetes risk and lower S-G, suggesting an alternative pathway to insulin for glucose disposal; and plexin-B2, which also was associated with increased diabetes risk, but with lower AIR(G), and not with S-I, indicating a mechanism related instead to pancreatic dysfunction. Other novel protein associations included alcohol dehydrogenase-1C, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase-B, sorbitol dehydrogenase with elevated type 2 diabetes risk, and a leucine-rich repeat containing protein-15 and myocilin with decreased risk.

AB  - Parallel to the dramatic rise of pediatric obesity, estimates reported an increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) already in childhood. The close relationship between obesity and T2D in children is mainly sustained by insulin resistance (IR). In addition, the cardiometabolic burden of T2D including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome is also strictly related to IR. Although T2D pathophysiology has been largely studied in an attempt to improve therapeutic options, molecular mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. In this perspective, omics approaches (including lipidomics, metabolomics, proteomics and metagenomics) are providing the most attractive therapeutic options for T2D. In particular, distinct both lipids and metabolites are emerging as potential therapeutic tools. Of note, among lipid classes, the pathogenic role of ceramides in T2D context has been supported by several data. Thus, selective changes of ceramides expression might represent innovative therapeutic strategies for T2D treatment. More, distinct metabolomics pathways have been also found to be associated with higher T2D risk, by providing novel potential T2D biomarkers. Taken together, omics data are responsible for the expanding knowledge of T2D pathophysiology, by providing novel insights to improve therapeutic strategies for this tangled disease. We aimed to summarize the most recent evidence in the intriguing field of the omics approaches in T2D both in adults and children.

AB  - Background: Identification of markers for prediction of the clinical course of diabetic nephropathy remains a major challenge in disease management. We established a proteomics approach for identification of diabetic nephropathy-related biomarkers in urine.
   Methods: We used SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry and SAX2 protein arrays to compare protein profiles from urine of 4 defined patient groups. Samples from patients with type 2 diabetes (DM; n = 45) without nephropathy and without microalbuminuria (DMWNP), patients with DM with macro- or microalbuminuria (DM-NP; n = 38), patients with proteinuria due to nondiabetic renal disease (n = 34), and healthy controls (n = 45) were analyzed. Anionic exchange, reversedphase fractionation, gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry were used to isolate and identify proteins with high discriminatory power.
   Results: A protein with mlz 6188 (P <0.0000004) was strongly released in the urine of healthy controls, patients with proteinuria due to nondiabetic disease, and DM-WNP in contrast to DM-NP patients. An mlz 14 766 protein (P <0.00008) was selectively excreted in the urine of DM-NP patients, whereas the protein with mlz 11774 (P <0.000004) was significantly excreted by patients with proteinuria and DM-NP. The mlz 11774 and mlz 14 766 mass peaks were identified as beta-microglobulin and UbA52, a ubiquitin ribosomal fusion protein, respectively. The protein with mlz 6188 was identified as a processed form of ubiquitin.
   Conclusion: The release of high amounts of UbA52 in urine of DM-NP patients could serve as a diagnostic marker, whereas the lack of the short form of ubiquitin raises interesting questions about the pathophysiology. (c) 2007 American Association for Clinical Chemistry

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has become a worldwide increasingly social health burden for its high morbidity and heightened prevalence. As one of the main tissues involved in uptake of glucose under the stimulation of insulin, WAT plays very important role in metabolic and homeostasis regulation. We performed a differential proteomics study to investigate alterations in epididymis fat pad of high fat diet fed T2D KKAy mice compared to normal fed C57BL/6J mice, by O-18-labeling relative quantitative technique. Among 329 confidently identified proteins, 121 proteins showed significant changes with CV <= 20% (fold changes of > 2 or < 0.5 as threshold). According to GO classification, we found that altered proteins contained members of biological processes of metabolic process, oxidative stress, ion homeostasis, apoptosis and cell division. In metabolic, proteins assigned to fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS etc.) were decreased, the key enzyme (ACOX3) in beta-oxidation process was increased. Increased glycolysis enzymes (ENOB etc.) and decreased TCA cycle related enzymes (SCOT1 etc.) suggested that glucose metabolism in mitochondria of T2D mice might be impaired. Elevated oxidative stress was observed with alterations of a series of oxidordeuctase (QSOX1 etc.). Besides, alterations of ion homeostasis (AT2C1 etc.) proteins were also observed. The enhancement of cell proliferation associated proteins (ELYS etc.) and inhibition of apoptosis associated proteins (RASF6 etc.) in WAT might contributed to the fat pad and body weight gain. Overall, these changes in WAT may serve as a reference for understanding the functional mechanism of T2D.

AB  - Introduction: Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) is a chronic complication in Type 2 diabetes. The Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD273) peptide classifier has been found to predict development of DKD even before microalbuminuria develops. Seventy four percent of peptides in the CKD273 classifier are Collagen degradation fragments. The Beta-CrossLaps (beta-CTx) Enzyme Llinked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) assay detects the specific collagen degradation product, C terminal telopeptide of Type 1 collagen. In light of the Capillary Electrophoresis/Mass Spectrometry (CE-MS) findings, linking collagen degradation fragments excretion to early detection of DKD, the significance of urinary beta-CTx levels as a DKD biomarker needs to be evaluated.
   Aim: To study the urinary excretion of beta-CTx in type 2 diabetes patients and to evaluate its relation to Microalbuminuria status and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of the patients.
   Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was undertaken at a tertiary care hospital, with enrollment of 82 type 2 diabetes patients from the diabetes Out Patient Department (OPD) Participants were divided into groups based on their Urinary Albumin Creatinine Ratio (UACR) and eGFR levels. The study participants were tested for Urinary beta-CTx level, UACR and eGFR. Mean or median was calculated for the parameters with normal and non-normal distribution, respectively. All statistical testing was performed on online calculators available at the site; https://www.socscistatistics.com/.
   Results: The median urinary beta-CTx level observed was 100.6 ng/mmol of creatinine. Among the 82 participants, 15 participants had urinary beta-CTx level 15pg/mL, the sensitivity of the kit. Among the remaining 67 participants, the minimum Urinary Beta-CrossLaps: Creatinine ratio observed was 2.6 ng/mmol and the maximum value observed was 2071 ng/mmol (i.e., 2.1 mu g/mmol). The median urinary beta-CTx level was highest (100.6 ng/mmol creatinine) in the patient group with eGFR in the normal range. The urinary beta-CTx level was found to decline with decline in eGFR, with median urinary beta-CTx 65.5 ng/mmol creatinine in the patient group with mildly decreased eGFR and 7.2 ng/mmol creatinine in the patient group with moderately decreased eGFR.
   Conclusion: The Urinary beta-CTx concentration in type 2 diabetes patients is dispersed over a wide range. The Urinary beta-CTx concentration correlates with the eGFR of the patient and is not influenced by age, gender or duration of diabetes. This parameter is a potential early DKD biomarker.

AB  - The incidences of obesity and type 2 diabetes are rapidly increasing and have evolved into a global epidemic. In this study, we analyzed the molecular effects of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin-resistance on mice in two metabolic target tissues, the white adipose tissue (WAT) and the liver. Additionally, we analyzed the effects of drug treatment using the specific PPAR? ligand rosiglitazone. We integrated transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome data sets for a combined holistic view of molecular mechanisms in type 2 diabetes. Using network and pathway analyses, we identified hub proteins such as SDHB and SUCLG1 in WAT and deregulation of major metabolic pathways in the insulin-resistant state, including the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and branched chain amino acid metabolism. Rosiglitazone treatment resulted mainly in modulation via PPAR signaling and oxidative phosphorylation in WAT only. Interestingly, in HFD liver, we could observe a decrease of proteins involved in vitamin B metabolism such as PDXDC1 and DHFR and the according metabolites. Furthermore, we could identify sphingosine (Sph) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (SP1) as a drug-specific marker pair in the liver. In summary, our data indicate physiological plasticity gained by interconnected molecular pathways to counteract metabolic dysregulation due to high calorie intake and drug treatment.

AB  - It has been suggested that high intake of added sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) increase the level of circulating inflammatory proteins and that chronic inflammation plays a role in type 2 diabetes (T2D) development. We aim to examine how added sugar and SSB intake associate with 136 measured plasma proteins and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the Malmo Diet and Cancer-Cardiovascular Cohort (n = 4382), and examine if the identified added sugar- and SSB-associated proteins associate with T2D incidence. A two-step iterative resampling approach was used to internally replicate proteins that associated with added sugar and SSB intake. Nine proteins were identified to associate with added sugar intake, of which only two associated with T2D incidence (p < 0.00045). Seven proteins were identified to associate with SSB intake, of which six associated strongly with T2D incidence (p < 6.9 x 10(-8)). No significant associations were observed between added sugar and SSB intake and CRP concentrations. In summary, our elucidation of the relationship between plasma proteome and added sugar and SSB intake, in relation to future T2D risk, demonstrated that SSB intake, rather than the total intake of added sugar, was related to a T2D-pathological proteomic signature. However, external replication is needed to verify the findings.

AB  - Background: Recent advances in proteomics have shed light to discover serum proteins or peptides as biomarkers for tracking the progression of diabetes as well as understanding molecular mechanisms of the disease.
   Results: In this work, human serum of non-diabetic and diabetic cohorts was analyzed by proteomic approach. To analyze total 1377 high-confident serum-proteins, we developed a computing strategy called localized statistics of protein abundance distribution (LSPAD) to calculate a significant bias of a particular protein-abundance between these two cohorts. As a result, 68 proteins were found significantly over-represented in the diabetic serum (p < 0.01). In addition, a pathway-associated analysis was developed to obtain the overall pathway bias associated with type 2 diabetes, from which the significant over-representation of complement system associated with type 2 diabetes was uncovered. Moreover, an upstream activator of complement pathway, ficolin-3, was observed over-represented in the serum of type 2 diabetic patients, which was further validated with statistic significance (p=0.012) with more clinical samples.
   Conclusions: The developed LSPAD approach is well fit for analyzing proteomic data derived from biological complex systems such as plasma proteome. With LSPAD, we disclosed the comprehensive distribution of the proteins associated with diabetes in different abundance levels and the involvement of ficolin-related complement activation in diabetes.

AB  - Aims: To determine whether biomarkers for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) can be used to determine the prevalence, progression and/or incidence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) complicating type 2 diabetes.
   Methods: Proteomic biomarkers were measured in baseline fasting plasma from 958 Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II participants whose baseline and, in those returning for follow-up (n = 764), Year 4 fundus photographs were graded for DR presence/severity. The performance of PromarkerD (three biomarkers and readily available clinical variables which identify prevalent DKD and predict incident DKD and estimated glomerular filtration rate decline >_30% over four years) for detecting DR prevalence, progression and incidence was assessed using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Logistic regression determined whether individual proteins were associated with DR outcomes after adjusting for the most parsimonious model.
   Results: Plasma apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4) was independently associated with moderate non-proliferative DR at baseline (OR (95% CI): 1.64 (1.01, 2.67), P = 0.047). Model discrimination was poor for all PromarkerD predicted probabilities against all DR outcomes (AUC <= 0.681).
   Conclusions: PromarkerD and its constituent biomarkers were not consistently associated with DR prevalence or temporal change. APOA4 was associated with prevalent DR, but not DR incidence or progression. Distinct pathophysiological mechanisms may underlie DKD and DR. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are complex diseases commonly associated with aging. Accumulating evidence indicates a connection between these two diseases at the molecular level. Much of what we currently know about T2D and AD is derived from in vivo and in vitro studies. However, further research and characterization of molecules is necessary to establish a strong connection between T2D and AD. In silico studies play a major role in finding non-evident patterns of gene expression and gene network connectivity. In this review, we give a brief introduction to T2D and AD and then describe the risk factors and molecules that are commonly associated with these diseases. Finally, we discuss the future directions and applications of bioinformatics that can provide greater insight into the relationship between these two diseases. Analysis and integration of high-throughput data on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics from normal and disease tissues would be very useful to improve our understanding of the mechanism behind disease initiation and the connection between these two diseases. We encourage researchers to use bioinformatics approaches to identify genes and their regulatory pathways that are commonly affected in T2D and AD, as these genes and pathways could be potential biomarkers and targets for disease treatment.

AB  - Recent evidence has indicated that total fiber intake is inversely related to type 2 diabetes risk. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic administration of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), a water-soluble dietary fiber, on the occurrence of diabetes and its complications, fatty liver and nephropathy. We also identified predictive serum biomarkers of treatment response to PHGG by mass spectroscopy-based proteomic analysis using Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a good model of human non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In this study, at 5 weeks of age, OLETF rats and control strain Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats were fed a control diet or a high-fiber diet (5% PHGG) for 57 weeks. Body weight, food intake, oral glucose tolerance test, plasma insulin levels, and urine glucose and protein levels were regularly measured. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and storage of serum in a deep freezer were conducted at the beginning of the experiment and every 4 weeks after overnight fasting during the experiments. PHGG treatment affected neither meal patterns nor the body weight of OLETF and LETO rats. Repeated measure analysis of variance revealed significant differences in fasting plasma glucose and plasma glucose at 2 h after OGTT between control OLETF (OLETF-C) rats and OLETF rats treated with PHGG (OLETF-F). The glucose response determined by the area under the curve of OGTT was significantly greater in OLETF-C rats than that in OLETF-F rats at 25 weeks of age. HOMA-IR, an index of insulin resistance, increased at 25 weeks of age in OLETF-C rats, while this increase was significantly inhibited in OLETF-F rats. At 62 weeks of age, PHGG treatment significantly improved hepatic steatosis as well as renal mesangial matrix accumulation in OLETF rats. To identify the risk marker for diabetes mellitus by SELDI-TOF MS, we collected sera from 21-week-old individuals. Among the 12 specific peaks that were risk marker candidates for diabetes mellitus, the m/z 13,720 peak was identified as that of cysteinylated transthyretin by sequencing of four tryptic peptides using tandem mass spectrometry and peak distribution around the m/z 13,720 peak in the SELDI-TOF spectra. In conclusion, we found that chronic treatment with PHGG improved insulin resistance, delayed the onset of diabetes, and Inhibited the development of diabetic complications, as well as Identified cysteinylated transthyretin as a predictive blomarker of treatment response to PHGG in OLETF rats.

AB  - Background: Diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D), is linked with an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). The present study aimed to evaluate potential circulating biomarkers of CHD by adopting a targeted proteomic approach based on proximity extension assays (PEA). Methods: The study was based on 30 patients with both T2D and CHD (group DC), 30 patients with T2D without CHD (group DN) and 29 patients without diabetes but with a diagnosis of CHD (group NC). Plasma samples were analyzed using PEA, with an Olink Target 96 cardiometabolic panel expressed as normalized protein expression (NPX) units. Results: Lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase (PRCP), Liver carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), Complement C2 (C2), and Intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM3) were lower in the DC and NC groups compared with the DN groups. Lithostathine-1-alpha (REG1A) and Immunoglobulin lambda constant 2 (IGLC2) were found higher in the DC group compared to DN and NC groups. ROC analysis suggested a significant ability of the six proteins to distinguish among the three groups (whole model test p < 0.0001, AUC 0.83-0.88), with a satisfactory discriminating performance in terms of sensitivity (77-90%) and specificity (70-90%). A possible role of IGLC2, PRCP, and REG1A in indicating kidney impairment was found, with a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 83%. Conclusions: The identified panel of six plasma proteins, using a targeted proteomic approach, provided evidence that these parameters could be considered in the chronic evolution of T2D and its complications.

AB  - Human beta-cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Consequently, improved understanding of the molecular and cellular processes critical to the normal function of these cells, and the ways in which these processes are disturbed during disease development, is central to efforts to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Detailed exploration of the transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic composition of islet cells provides a platform for defining cellular function. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing approaches is enabling ever more complete inventories of the islet transcriptome, and these data are already providing important insights into islet biology. For example, transcriptome data have contributed to: (a) definition of transcript candidacy at T2D-associated loci; (b) identification of novel disease biomarkers; (c) characterisation of novel regulatory mechanisms (such as those involving non-coding RNAs), and (d) discovery of factors of potential relevance to beta-cell reprogramming efforts.

AB  - Proteome analysis of serum from type 2 diabetics with complications may lead to the discovery of diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. To circumvent the principal barrier of serum proteomics, our investigation aimed to evaluate whether a study of post-translational modification enriched serum proteins could be valuable for the discovery of biomarkers or metabolic pathways related to type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. Type 2 diabetes was induced from high-fat diet fed Sprague Dawley rats with streptozotocin injection. Once diabetic status was confirmed, serum samples from either fasted healthy or diabetic rats were pooled and profiled by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis or comparative 2D electrophoresis after protein enrichments using immobilized metal ion, concanavalin A, and lentil affinity chromatography, respectively. Differential expressed proteins were identified and the associated networks were established by an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. As a result, induced rats became severe diabetic and accompanied by hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, and glomerular hypertrophy. There were 3 total, 14 phosphorylated and 23 glycosylated protein targets differentially expressed. Proteins could be linked to HNF4A, HNF1A, and NF kappa B transcriptional factors and antigen presentation, humoral immune response, and inflammatory response pathways. Predicted organ toxicity in kidney, heart, and liver matched with our histopathological results. In conclusion, post-translational modification based serum protein enrichment could be a valuable approach to enhance the resolution of serum proteomics without depleting potentially valuable abundant proteins. Our results also indicated the potential association of the hepatic secretome and hepatocyte nuclear factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and its complications.

AB  - Introduction Adipsin or complement factor D is an adipokine that augments insulin secretion, is altered in various degrees of obesity, and is involved in alternative complement pathway. However, whether adipsin has any independent association with risk factors and biomarkers in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains elusive.Research design and methods We performed an oral glucose tolerance test on a subset of 43 patients with T2D from the community health cohort to access the role of adipsin in insulin secretion. We further cross-sectionally examined the role of adipsin in plasma, adipose tissue (AT), and secretion in a community cohort of 353 subjects and a hospital cohort of 52 subjects.Results We found that plasma adipsin has no significant correlation with insulin secretion in people with diabetes. Among the risk factors of T2D, adipsin levels were independently associated only with age, and a positive correlation between plasma adipsin and age among subjects without T2D was lost in patients with T2D. Plasma adipsin levels, AT adipsin expression, and secretion were upregulated both in T2D and aging, with a corresponding drop in Homeostatic Model Assessment for assessing beta-cell function. Adipsin expression was positively associated with other aging biomarkers, such as beta-galactosidase, p21, and p16. These results also corroborated with existing plasma proteomic signatures of aging, including growth, and differentiation factor-15, which strongly correlated with adipsin.Conclusions Our results demonstrate an increase in circulating adipsin in T2D and aging, and it scores as a candidate plasma marker for aging specifically in non-T2D population.

AB  - Background: Therapies can reduce the risk of heart failure (HF) development and progression in type 2 diabetes; nevertheless, the risk of these outcomes is greater in females than in males. Methods and Results: To investigate sex differences in HF development and progression, we compared baseline circulating proteins (Olink Cardiovascular II panel) in males and females with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome for the outcome of HF hospitalization. Data were from the placebo-controlled Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin vs Standard of Care (EXAMINE) trial. Pathophysiological sex-differences were interpreted with network and pathway over-representation analyses. The EXAMINE trial enrolled 5380 participants (32.1% females) with biomarker data available for 95.4% of individuals. Analyses revealed 43 biomarkers were differentially expressed in HF hospitalization, of which 18 were sex specific. Among these 43 biomarkers, interleukin-6 was identified as a central node for the pathogenesis of HF hospitalization in both females and in males. Additional pathway over-representation analyses demonstrated that biomarkers associated with inflammatory pathways related to endothelial dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis were more up-regulated in females than males with HF hospitalization. Differential expression of 3 biomarkers (pentraxin-related protein 3, hydroxyacid oxidase 1, and carbonic anhydrase 5A) was independently associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalization in females but not in males (interaction P < .05). Conclusions: In males and females with type 2 diabetes and acute coronary syndrome, interleukin-6 seems to be central in the pathogenesis of HF. Females exhibit higher levels of circulating proteins related to immunological pathways, reflecting sex-specific differences underlying HF development and progression.

AB  - We analyzed the urine samples of patients with type 2 diabetes at various stages of diabetic nephropathy by lectin microarray to identify a biomarker to predict the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes at various stages of nephropathy were enrolled and we performed lectin microarray analyses (n = 17) and measured urinary excretion of fetuin-A (n = 85). The increased signals of urine samples were observed in Sia alpha 2-6Gal/GalNAc-binding lectins (SNA, SSA, TJA-I) during the progression of diabetic nephropathy. We next isolated sialylated glycoproteins by using SSA-lectin affinity chromatography and identified fetuin-A by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer. Urinary excretion of fetuin-A significantly increased during the progression of albuminuria (A1, 0.40 +/- 0.43; A2, 0.60 +/- 0.53; A3 1.57 +/- 1.13 ng/gCr; p = 7.29x10(-8)) and of GFR stages (G1, 0.39 +/- 0.39; G2, 0.49 +/- 0.45; G3, 1.25 +/- 1.18; G4, 1.34 +/- 0.80 ng/gCr; p = 3.89x10(-4)). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to assess fetuin-A as a risk for diabetic nephropathy with microalbuminuria or GFR<60 mL/min. Fetuin-A is demonstrated as a risk factor for both microalbuminuria and reduction of GFR in diabetic nephropathy with the odds ratio of 4.721 (1.881-11.844) and 3.739 (1.785-7.841), respectively. Collectively, the glycan profiling analysis is useful method to identify the urine biomarkers and fetuin-A is a candidate to predict the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

AB  - Context Circulating proteomes may provide intervention targets for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Objective We aimed to identify proteomic biomarkers associated with incident T2D and assess its joint effect with dietary or lifestyle factors on the T2D risk. Methods We established 2 nested case-control studies for incident T2D: discovery cohort (median 6.5 years of follow-up, 285 case-control pairs) and validation cohort (median 2.8 years of follow-up, 38 case-control pairs). We integrated untargeted mass spectrometry-based proteomics and interpretable machine learning to identify T2D-related proteomic biomarkers. We constructed a protein risk score (PRS) with the identified proteomic biomarkers and used a generalized estimating equation to evaluate PRS-T2D relationship with repeated profiled proteome. We evaluated association of PRS with trajectory of glycemic traits in another non-T2D cohort (n = 376). Multiplicative interactions of dietary or lifestyle factors with PRS were evaluated using logistic regression. Results Seven proteins (SHBG, CAND1, APOF, SELL, MIA3, CFH, IGHV1-2) were retained as the proteomic biomarkers for incident T2D. PRS (per SD change) was positively associated with incident T2D across 2 cohorts, with an odds ratio 1.29 (95% CI, 1.08-1.54) and 1.84 (1.19-2.84), respectively. Participants with a higher PRS had a higher probability showing unfavored glycemic trait trajectory in the non-T2D cohort. Red meat intake and PRS showed a multiplicative interaction on T2D risk in the discovery (P = 0.003) and validation cohort (P = 0.017). Conclusion This study identified proteomic biomarkers for incident T2D among the Chinese populations. The higher intake of red meat may synergistically interact with the proteomic biomarkers to exaggerate the T2D risk.

AB  - Context Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major global concern, with Asia at its epicenter in recent years. Proteins, products of gene transcription, serve as dynamic biomarkers for pinpointing perturbed pathways in disease development. Previous T2D proteomic association studies primarily focused on European populations.Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between plasma proteins and the incidence of T2D in Asian individuals.Methods We examined the association of 4775 plasma proteins with incident T2D in a Singapore multi-ethnic cohort of 1659 Asian individuals (539 cases and 1120 controls) using logistic regression. We used 2-sample mendelian randomization and colocalization analysis to evaluate the causal relationship between proteins and T2D.Results Our analysis revealed 522 proteins that were associated with incident T2D after adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity, and 17 proteins that remained statistically significantly associated after adjusting for other T2D risk factors such as fasting glucose, waist circumference, and triglycerides. Among the 522 proteins associated with incident T2D, the change in 205 plasma proteins, observed in parallel with the development of T2D at baseline and 6-year follow-up, were further associated with incident T2D. The associated proteins showed enrichment in neuron generation, glycosaminoglycan binding, and insulin-like growth factor binding. Two-sample mendelian randomization analysis suggested 3 plasma proteins, GSTA1, INHBC, and FGL1, play causal roles in the development of T2D, with colocalization evidence supporting GSTA1 and INHBC.Conclusion Our findings reveal plasma protein profiles linked to the onset of T2D in Asian populations, offering insights into the biological mechanisms of T2D development.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine condition in women of reproductive age, and several risk factors found in PCOS are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Proteins increased in AD have been reported to include fibronectin (FN) fragments 3 and 4 (FN1.3 and FN1.4, respectively) and ApoE. We hypothesized that Alzheimer-related proteins would be dysregulated in PCOS because of associated insulin resistance and obesity. In this comparative cross-sectional analysis, aptamer-based SomaScan proteomic analysis for the detection of plasma Alzheimer-related proteins was undertaken in a PCOS biobank of 143 women with PCOS and 97 control women. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) (p < 0.05) and amyloid P-component (APCS) (p < 0.001) were elevated in PCOS, while alpha-synuclein (SNCA) (p < 0.05) was reduced in PCOS. Associations with protective heat shock proteins (HSPs) showed that SNCA positively correlated with HSP90 (p < 0.0001) and HSP60 (p < 0.0001) in both the PCOS and control women. Correlations with markers of inflammation showed that APCS correlated with interleukin 6 (IL6) (p = 0.04), while Apolipoprotein (Apo) E3 correlated with TNF-alpha (p = 0.02). FN, FN1.3, FN1.4 and ApoE were all elevated significantly (p < 0.05). An AD-associated protein pattern with elevated FN, FN1.3, FN1.4 and ApoE was found in PCOS, in addition to elevated APP and reduced SNCA, which was the same as reported for type 2 diabetes (T2D) with, additionally, an elevation in APCS. With the AD biomarker pattern in PCOS being very similar to that in T2D, where there is an association between AD and T2D, this suggests that larger prospective cohort studies are needed in women with PCOS to determine if there is a causal association with AD.

AB  - Introduction Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with diabetes is the leading cause of death. Finding early biomarkers for detecting asymptomatic patients with CVD can improve survival. Recently, plasma proteomics-targeted selected reaction monitoring/multiple reaction monitoring analyses (MRM)-has emerged as highly specific and sensitive tools compared with classic ELISA methods. The objective was to identify differentially regulated proteins according to the severity of the coronary artery atherosclerosis.
   Research design and methods A discovery cohort, a verification cohort and a validation cohort consisted of 18, 53, and 228 subjects, respectively. The grade of coronary artery stenosis was defined as a percentage of luminal stenosis of the major coronary arteries. Participants were divided into six groups, depending on the presence of diabetes and the grade of coronary artery stenosis. Two mass spectrometric approaches were employed: (1) conventional shotgun liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for a discovery and (2) quantitative MRM for verification and validation. An analysis of the covariance was used to examine the biomarkers' predictivity beyond conventional cardiovascular risks.
   Results A total of 1349 different proteins were identified from a discovery cohort. We selected 52 proteins based on the tandem mass tag quantitative analysis then summarized as follows: chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 7 (CXCL7), apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2), human lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) in diabetes; CXCL7, APOC2, LBP, complement 4A (C4A), vitamin D-binding protein (VTDB) and laminin beta 1 subunit in non-diabetes. Analysis of covariance showed that APOC2, DOCK2, CXCL7 and VTDB were upregulated and C4A was downregulated in patients with diabetes showing severe coronary artery stenosis. LBP and VTDB were downregulated in patients without diabetes, showing severe coronary artery stenosis.
   Conclusion We identified significant associations between circulating APOC2, C4A, CXCL7, DOCK2, LBP and VTDB levels and the degree of coronary artery stenosis using the MRM technique.

AB  - Background: Diabetes like many diseases and biological processes is not mono-causal. On the one hand multifactorial studies with complex experimental design are required for its comprehensive analysis. On the other hand, the data from these studies often include a substantial amount of redundancy such as proteins that are typically represented by a multitude of peptides. Coping simultaneously with both complexities (experimental and technological) makes data analysis a challenge for Bioinformatics.
   Results: We present a comprehensive work-flow tailored for analyzing complex data including data from multifactorial studies. The developed approach aims at revealing effects caused by a distinct combination of experimental factors, in our case genotype and diet. Applying the developed work-flow to the analysis of an established polygenic mouse model for diet-induced type 2 diabetes, we found peptides with significant fold changes exclusively for the combination of a particular strain and diet. Exploitation of redundancy enables the visualization of peptide correlation and provides a natural way of feature selection for classification and prediction. Classification based on the features selected using our approach performs similar to classifications based on more complex feature selection methods.
   Conclusions: The combination of ANOVA and redundancy exploitation allows for identification of biomarker candidates in multi-dimensional MALDI-TOF MS profiling studies with complex experimental design. With respect to feature selection our method provides a fast and intuitive alternative to global optimization strategies with comparable performance. The method is implemented in R and the scripts are available by contacting the corresponding author.

AB  - Background Currently, early diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) remains a major challenge. Thus, more investigations into new DN-related biomarkers are needed.
   Methods We employed urinary proteomic approach of fluorescence-based difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) and mass spectrometry to identify novel biomarkers in urine samples, which were from type 2 diabetes patients with normoalbuminuria (DM group), microalbuminuria (DN1 group), macroalbuminuria (DN2 group) and control group (n = 8 in each group). The identified biomarker was further studied by western blot in urine samples (n = 6 in each group) and immunohistochemistry in renal biopsies. Besides, the urinary level of biomarker was detected and analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) method (n = 40 in each group).
   Results A novel DN-related biomarker, urinary E-cadherin, was identified by proteomic methods, which up-regulated 1.3-fold, 5.2-fold and 8.5-fold in DM, DN1 and DN2 groups compared with control group. Meanwhile, high expression of urinary soluble 80 kDa fragment of E-cadherin (sE-cadherin) was verified in DN groups by western blot. The ELISA data also demonstrated that urinary sE-cadherin-to-creatinine ratio was significantly increased in DN1 and DN2 groups versus DM group or control group (2751.5 +/- 164 and 5839.6 +/- 428 vs 721.9 +/- 93 or 652.7 +/- 87 mu g/g; p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of urinary sE-cadherin for diagnosis of DN were calculated as 78.8% (95% CI, 74-83%) and 80% (95% CI, 65-91%). Besides, immunohistochemical stain showed that E-cadherin expression was markedly decreased in renal tubular epithelial cells of patients with DN versus healthy controls.
   Conclusions Urinary sE-cadherin has a potential clinical diagnostic value for DN and E-cadherin may participate in the pathogenesis of DN. Copyright (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - White adipose tissue (WAT) is important for metabolic homeostasis. We established the differential proteomic signatures of WAT in glucose-tolerant lean and obese individuals and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the response to 8 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Using a high-throughput and reproducible mass spectrometry-based proteomics pipeline, we identified 3773 proteins and found that most regulated proteins displayed progression in markers of dysfunctional WAT from lean to obese to T2D individuals and were highly associated with clinical measures such as insulin sensitivity and HbA1c. We propose that these distinct markers could serve as potential clinical biomarkers. HIIT induced only minor changes in the WAT proteome. This included an increase in WAT ferritin levels independent of obesity and T2D, and WAT ferritin levels were strongly correlated with individual insulin sensitivity. Together, we report a proteomic signature of WAT related to obesity and T2D and highlight an unrecognized role of human WAT iron metabolism in exercise training adaptations.

AB  - Over the last two decades, a large number of non-communicable/chronic disorders reached an epidemic level on a global scale such as diabetes mellitus type 2, cardio-vascular disease, several types of malignancies, neurological and eye pathologies-all exerted system's enormous socio-economic burden to primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare. The paradigm change from reactive to predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (3PM/PPPM) has been declared as an essential transformation of the overall healthcare approach to benefit the patient and society at large. To this end, specific biomarker panels are instrumental for a cost-effective predictive approach of individualized prevention and treatments tailored to the person. The source of biomarkers is crucial for specificity and reliability of diagnostic tests and treatment targets. Furthermore, any diagnostic approach preferentially should be noninvasive to increase availability of the biomaterial, and to decrease risks of potential complications as well as concomitant costs. These requirements are clearly fulfilled by tear fluid, which represents a precious source of biomarker panels. The well-justified principle of a "sick eye in a sick body" makes comprehensive tear fluid biomarker profiling highly relevant not only for diagnostics of eye pathologies but also for prediction, prognosis, and treatment monitoring of systemic diseases. One prominent example is the Sicca syndrome linked to a cascade of severe complications that include dry eye, neurologic, and oncologic diseases. In this review, protein profiles in tear fluid are highlighted and corresponding biomarkers are exemplified for several relevant pathologies, including dry eye disease, diabetic retinopathy, cancers, and neurological disorders. Corresponding analytical approaches such as sample pre-processing, differential proteomics, electrophoretic techniques, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA), microarrays, and mass spectrometry (MS) methodology are detailed. Consequently, we proposed the overall strategies based on the tear fluid biomarkers application for 3P medicine practice. In the context of 3P medicine, tear fluid analytical pathways are considered to predict disease development, to target preventive measures, and to create treatment algorithms tailored to individual patient profiles.

AB  - Introduction and objectives: Studies on younger frail and pre-frail subjects suffering from heart failure (HF) are scarce, except for those focusing on the critically ill. This work aims to describe differences between younger (<65 years) and older (>= 65 years) pre-frail and frail HF outpatients regarding their nutritional, functional and clinical statuses.Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a sample of 99 HF frail and pre-frail patients (aged 24-81 years, 38.4% women, 21.2% frail, 59.6% <65 years) was recruited from an HF outpatients' clinic in northern Portugal. Muscle mass was estimated from mid-upper arm muscle circumference. Weight status was assessed using body mass index. Hand grip strength and gait speed were measured. Medical records were reviewed. Associations between participants' characteristics and age were calculated using binary logistic regression.Results: Age was associated with hand grip strength (OR=0.90), gait speed (OR=0.01) and dia-betes (OR=4.95). Obesity, muscle mass or heart failure functional classes were not associated with age categories.Conclusion: There is an overall lack of differentiation between younger and older HF patients with the frailty phenotype. Therefore, frailty phenotype should be assessed in all patients, regardless of age. Hand grip strength seems to be a good predictor for older age and more studies are needed to define age-specific hand grip strength cut-offs for HF populations.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is not fully understood. We investigated whether circulating levels of preselected proteins were associated with the outcome 'diabetes' and whether these associations were causal. Methods In 2467 individuals of the population-based, cross-sectional EpiHealth study (45-75 years, 50% women), 249 plasma proteins were analysed by the proximity extension assay technique. DNA was genotyped using the Illumina HumanCoreExome-12 v1.0 BeadChip. Diabetes was defined as taking glucose-lowering treatment or having a fasting plasma glucose of >= 7.0 mmol/l. The associations between proteins and diabetes were assessed using logistic regression. To investigate causal relationships between proteins and diabetes, a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomisation was performed based on large, genome-wide association studies belonging to the DIAGRAM and MAGIC consortia, and a genome-wide association study in the EpiHealth study. Results Twenty-six proteins were positively associated with diabetes, including cathepsin D, retinal dehydrogenase 1, alpha-l-iduronidase, hydroxyacid oxidase 1 and galectin-4 (top five findings). Three proteins, lipoprotein lipase, IGF-binding protein 2 and paraoxonase 3 (PON-3), were inversely associated with diabetes. Fourteen of the proteins are novel discoveries. The Mendelian randomisation study did not disclose any significant causal effects between the proteins and diabetes in either direction that were consistent with the relationships found between the protein levels and diabetes. Conclusions/interpretation The 29 proteins associated with diabetes are involved in several physiological pathways, but given the power of the study no causal link was identified for those proteins tested in Mendelian randomisation. Therefore, the identified proteins are likely to be biomarkers for type 2 diabetes, rather than representing causal pathways.

AB  - OBJECTIVE - We examined whether proteomic technologies identify novel urine proteins associated with subsequent development of diabetic nephropathy in subjects with type 2 diabetes before evidence of microalbuminuria.
   RESEACH DESIGN AND METHODS - in a nested case-control study of Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes, baseline (serum creatinine < 1.2 mg/dl and urine albumin excretion < 30 mg/g) and 10-year urine samples were examined. Case subjects (n = 31) developed diabetic nephropathy (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g) over 10 years. Control subjects (n = 3 1) were matched to case subjects (1: 1) according to diabetes duration, age, sex, and BMI but remained normoalbuminuric (albumin-to-creatinine ratio < 30 mg/g) over the same 10 years. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) was performed on baseline urine samples, and training (14 cases:14 controls) and validation (17:17) sets were tested.
   RESULTS - At baseline, A1C levels differed between case and control subjects. SELDI-TOF MS detected 714 unique urine protein peaks. Of these, a 12-peak proteomic signature correctly predicted 89% of cases of diabetic nepropathy (93% sensitivity, 86% specificity) in the training set. Applying this same signature to the independent validation set yielded an accuracy rate of 74% (71% sensitivity, 76% specificity). In multivariate analyses, the 12-peak signature was independently associated with subsequent diabetic nephropathy when applied to the validation set (odds ratio [OR] 7.9 [95% CI 1.5-43.5], P = 0.017) and the entire dataset (14.5 [3.7-55.6], P = 0.001), and A1C levels were no longer significant.
   CONCLUSIONS - Urine proteomic, profiling identifies normoalbuminuric subjects with type 2 diabetes who subsequently develop diabetic nephropathy. Further studies are needed to characterize the specific proteins involved in this early prediction.

AB  - Aims/hypothesisAs part of the Surrogate Markers for Micro- and Macrovascular Hard Endpoints for Innovative Diabetes Tools (SUMMIT) programme we previously reported that large panels of biomarkers derived from three analytical platforms maximised prediction of progression of renal decline in type 2 diabetes. Here, we hypothesised that smaller (n5), platform-specific combinations of biomarkers selected from these larger panels might achieve similar prediction performance when tested in three additional type 2 diabetes cohorts.MethodsWe used 657 serum samples, held under differing storage conditions, from the Scania Diabetes Registry (SDR) and Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research Tayside (GoDARTS), and a further 183 nested case-control sample set from the Collaborative Atorvastatin in Diabetes Study (CARDS). We analysed 42 biomarkers measured on the SDR and GoDARTS samples by a variety of methods including standard ELISA, multiplexed ELISA (Luminex) and mass spectrometry. The subset of 21 Luminex biomarkers was also measured on the CARDS samples. We used the event definition of loss of >20% of baseline eGFR during follow-up from a baseline eGFR of 30-75mlmin(-1) [1.73m](-2). A total of 403 individuals experienced an event during a median follow-up of 7years. We used discrete-time logistic regression models with tenfold cross-validation to assess association of biomarker panels with loss of kidney function.ResultsTwelve biomarkers showed significant association with eGFR decline adjusted for covariates in one or more of the sample sets when evaluated singly. Kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) and (2)-microglobulin (B2M) showed the most consistent effects, with standardised odds ratios for progression of at least 1.4 (p<0.0003) in all cohorts. A combination of B2M and KIM-1 added to clinical covariates, including baseline eGFR and albuminuria, modestly improved prediction, increasing the area under the curve in the SDR, Go-DARTS and CARDS by 0.079, 0.073 and 0.239, respectively. Neither the inclusion of additional Luminex biomarkers on top of B2M and KIM-1 nor a sparse mass spectrometry panel, nor the larger multiplatform panels previously identified, consistently improved prediction further across all validation sets.Conclusions/interpretationSerum KIM-1 and B2M independently improve prediction of renal decline from an eGFR of 30-75mlmin(-1) [1.73m](-2) in type 2 diabetes beyond clinical factors and prior eGFR and are robust to varying sample storage conditions. Larger panels of biomarkers did not improve prediction beyond these two biomarkers.

AB  - Risk prediction for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains suboptimal even after the introduction of global risk assessment by various scores. This has prompted the search for additional biomarkers. A variety of blood biomarkers representing various pathophysiological pathways of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, as well as markers of subclinical disease and genetic markers, have been investigated. This review provides an overview of studies assessing the clinical utility of various biomarkers on the basis of hypothesis-driven selection as well as hypothesis-free approaches from novel "-omics" technologies. So far, the assessment of genotypes and of several candidate biomarkers from blood has resulted in only small improvements in the accuracy of prediction of CVD and T2D over and above that predicted on the basis of established risk factors. Integrated approaches, combining biomarkers from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, as well as serial measurements of biomarkers, are required to make a complete assessment of the potential clinical usefulness of biomarkers for risk prediction of cardiometabolic disease.

AB  - Objective: To detect urinary proteomic profiling of patients with type 2 diabetes by using ProteinChip array technology, for searching new potential biomarkers in early diagnosis of type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN).
   Methods: A total of 95 urine samples from type 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria (DM, n = 30), microalbuminuria (DNl, n = 25) and macroalbuminuria (DN2, n = 20), and healthy controls (n = 20) were analyzed by SELDI- TOF- MS (the surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) technology combined with bioinformatics tools.
   Results: Over 300 proteins or peptides from 1 to 80 kDa were obtained using ProteinChip. About 40 of them with the m/ z values from 2008.78 to 79176.55 Da were significantly differentiated between type 2 diabetic patients and control subjects. Four proteins of mass 2797.03, 4545.77, 4984.03 and 9083.71 Da were selected as the potential biomarkers for T2DN with sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 96.7%.
   Conclusion: ProteinChip technology can help to discover new biomarkers and provide a novel non- invasive tool to early diagnosis of T2DN. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The circulating proteome offers insights into the biological pathways that underlie disease. Here, we test relationships between 1,468 Olink protein levels and the incidence of 23 age-related diseases and mortality in the UK Biobank (n = 47,600). We report 3,209 associations between 963 protein levels and 21 incident outcomes. Next, protein-based scores (ProteinScores) are developed using penalized Cox regression. When applied to test sets, six ProteinScores improve the area under the curve estimates for the 10-year onset of incident outcomes beyond age, sex and a comprehensive set of 24 lifestyle factors, clinically relevant biomarkers and physical measures. Furthermore, the ProteinScore for type 2 diabetes outperforms a polygenic risk score and HbA1c-a clinical marker used to monitor and diagnose type 2 diabetes. The performance of scores using metabolomic and proteomic features is also compared. These data characterize early proteomic contributions to major age-related diseases, demonstrating the value of the plasma proteome for risk stratification.
   Gadd et al. identify proteins circulating in the blood that can stratify the risk people have of developing a range of leading age-related diseases, up to a decade before onset.

AB  - Low-abundance regulatory peptides, including metabolically important gut hormones, have shown promising therapeutic potential. Here, we present a streamlined mass spectrometry-based platform for identifying and characterizing low-abundance regulatory peptides in humans. We demonstrate the clinical applicability of this platform by studying a hitherto neglected glucose-and appetite-regulating gut hormone, namely, oxyntomodulin. Our results show that the secretion of oxyntomodulin in patients with type 2 diabetes is significantly impaired, and that its level is increased by more than 10-fold after gastric bypass surgery. Furthermore, we report that oxyntomodulin is co-distributed and co-secreted with the insulin-stimulating and appetite-regulating gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), is inactivated by the same protease (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) as GLP-1 and acts through its receptor. Thus, oxyntomodulin may participate with GLP-1 in the regulation of glucose metabolism and appetite in humans. In conclusion, this mass spectrometry-based platformis a powerful resource for identifying and characterizing metabolically active low-abundance peptides. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - HIV and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are both associated with gut microbiota alterations, low-grade endotoxemia and increased cardiovascular risk. We investigated the potential role of plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) in relation to these processes. Plasma EVs were isolated by size exclusion chromatography in fasting individuals with HIV and T2D (n = 16), T2D only (n = 14), HIV only (n = 20) or healthy controls (n = 19), and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, western blot, nanoparticle tracking analysis and quantitative proteomics. The findings were compared to gut microbiota alterations, lipopolysaccharide levels and cardiovascular risk profile. Individuals with concomitant HIV and T2D had higher plasma EV concentration, which correlated closely with plasma lipopolysaccharides, triglycerides and Framingham score, but not with gut microbiota alterations. Proteomic analyses identified 558 human proteins, largely related to cardiometabolic disease genes and upstream regulation of inflammatory pathways, including IL-6 and IL-1 beta, as well as 30 bacterial proteins, mostly from lipopolysaccharide-producing Proteobacteria. Our study supports that EVs are related to microbial translocation processes in individuals with HIV and T2D. Their proteomic content suggests a contributing role in low-grade inflammation and cardiovascular risk development. The present approach for exploring gut-host crosstalk can potentially identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

AB  - Aim: Among multi-ethnic Asians, type 2 diabetes (T2D) clustered in three subtypes; mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD), mild age-related diabetes with insulin insufficiency (MARD-II) and severe insulin-resistant diabetes with relative insulin insufficiency (SIRD-RII) had differential cardio-renal complication risk. We assessed the proteomic profiles to identify subtype specific biomarkers and its association with diabetes complications. Methods: 1448 plasma proteins at baseline were measured and compared across the T2D subtypes. Multivariable cox regression was used to assess associations between significant proteomics features and cardio-renal complications. Results: Among 645 T2D participants (SIRD-RII [19%], MOD [45%], MARD-II [36%]), 295 proteins expression differed significantly across the groups. These proteins were enriched in cell adhesion, neurogenesis and inflammatory response processes. In SIRD-RII group, ADH4, ACY1, THOP1, IGFBP2, NEFL, ENTPD2, CALB1, HAO1, CTSV, ITGAV, SCLY, EDA2R, ERBB2 proteins significantly associated with progressive CKD and LILRA5 protein with incident heart failure (HF). In MOD group, TAFA5, RSPO3, EDA2R proteins significantly associated with incident HF. In MARD-II group, FABP4 protein significantly associated with progressive CKD and PTPRN2 protein with major adverse cardiovascular events. Genetically determined NEFL and CALB1 were associated with kidney function decline. Conclusions: Each T2D subtype has unique proteomics signature and association with clinical outcomes and underlying mechanisms.

AB  - In this study, we aimed to comprehensively characterize the proteomic landscapes of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in patients with severe obesity, to establish their associations with clinical characteristics, and to identify potential serum protein biomarkers indicative of tissue-specific alterations or metabolic states. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 32 patients with severe obesity (16 males and 16 females) of Central European descent who underwent bariatric surgery. Clinical parameters and body composition were assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioelectrical impedance, with 15 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 17 with hypertension. Paired SAT and VAT samples, along with serum samples, were subjected to state-of-the-art proteomics liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Our analysis identified 7,284 proteins across SAT and VAT, with 1,249 differentially expressed proteins between the tissues and 1,206 proteins identified in serum. Correlation analyses between differential protein expression and clinical traits suggest a significant role of SAT in the pathogenesis of obesity and related metabolic complications. Specifically, the SAT proteomic profile revealed marked alterations in metabolic pathways and processes contributing to tissue fibrosis and inflammation. Although we do not establish a definitive causal relationship, it appears that VAT might respond to SAT metabolic dysfunction by potentially enhancing mitochondrial activity and expanding its capacity. However, when this adaptive response is exceeded, it could possibly contribute to insulin resistance (IR) and in some cases, it may be associated with the progression to T2D. Our findings provide critical insights into the molecular foundations of SAT and VAT in obesity and may inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study provides insights into distinct proteomic profiles of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and serum in patients with severe obesity and their associations with clinical traits and body composition. It underscores SAT's crucial role in obesity development and related complications, such as insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our findings emphasize the importance of understanding the SAT and VAT balance in energy homeostasis, proteostasis, and the potential role of SAT capacity in the development of metabolic disorders.

AB  - center dot PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between choriocapillaris flow deficit percentage (CC FD%) by swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA) and 3-year risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) progression and diabetic macular edema (DME) develop-ment.center dot DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study.center dot METHODS: A total of 903 participants with type 2 dia-betes mellitus (T2DM) without DR or with mild nonpro-liferative DR (NPDR) free of DME at baseline were fol-lowed up annually for 3 years. All participants underwent standard 7-field fundus photography and spectral-domain OCT. SS-OCTA was used for retinal and choriocapillaris imaging and 3 x 3-mm2 macular CC FD% was quantified. Univariate and multivariate logistic models were used to evaluate the association between CC FD% and 2 or more steps of DR progression and DME development. The ad-ditional predictive value of CC FD% for outcome events was assessed using C statistic, net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement index (IDI).center dot RESULTS: Over 3 years, 295 of 1805 eyes (16.34%) developed DR progression, and 118 eyes (6.54%) devel-oped DME. A higher average CC FD% was correlated with DR progression (odds ratio [OR], 3.41 per SD in-crease, 95% CI: 2.65-4.39, P < .001) and DME devel-opment (OR, 1.37 per SD increase, 95% CI: 1.06-1.77, P = .016) after adjusting for confounders. In the ET -DRS regions, increased CC FD% in all fields was associ-ated with DR progression; however, increased CC FD% in the inferior field was associated with DME develop-ment. Compared with the models based on established risk factors, the addition of average CC FD% significantly improved the C statistics for DR progression (0.712 to 0.777, P < .001) and DME occurrence (0.743 to 0.773, P = .044). The estimated NRIs and IDIs (all > 0) indi-cated that the addition of CC FD% led to a significant improvement in the discriminative performance for end points.center dot CONCLUSION: CC FD% is independently associated with DR progression and DME development in the Chi-nese T2DM population and provides incremental predic-tive value beyond traditional risk factors and retinal mi-crovascular parameters. Further inclusion of CC FD% in DR prediction models helps guide population-based screening and personalized management. (Am J Oph-thalmol 2023;248: 76-86. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.)

AB  - BackgroundSemaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, is a widely used drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that offers significant cardiovascular benefits.ResultsThis review systematically examines the proteomic and metabolomic indicators associated with the cardiovascular effects of semaglutide. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies. The review utilizes advanced analytical technologies such as mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of semaglutide on insulin secretion, weight control, anti-inflammatory activities and lipid metabolism. These "omics" approaches offer critical insights into metabolic changes associated with cardiovascular health. However, challenges remain such as individual variability in expression, the need for comprehensive validation and the integration of these data with clinical parameters. These issues need to be addressed through further research to refine these indicators and increase their clinical utility.ConclusionFuture integration of proteomic and metabolomic data with artificial intelligence (AI) promises to improve prediction and monitoring of cardiovascular outcomes and may enable more accurate and effective management of cardiovascular health in patients with type 2 diabetes. This review highlights the transformative potential of integrating proteomics, metabolomics and AI to advance cardiovascular medicine and improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Background Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major global health concern, especially among individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Given the crucial role of proteins in various biological processes, this study aimed to elucidate the aetiological role and predictive performance of protein biomarkers on incident CHD in individuals with and without T2D.
   Methods The discovery cohort included 1492 participants from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) S4 study with 147 incident CHD cases (45 vs. 102 cases in the group with T2D and without T2D, respectively) during 15.6 years of follow-up. The validation cohort included 888 participants from the KORA-Age1 study with 70 incident CHD cases (19 vs. 51 cases in the group with T2D and without T2D, respectively) during 6.9 years of follow-up. We measured 233 plasma proteins related to cardiovascular disease and inflammation using proximity extension assay technology. Associations of proteins with incident CHD were assessed using Cox regression and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Predictive models were developed using priority-Lasso and were evaluated on top of Framingham risk score variables using the C-index, category-free net reclassification index (cfNRI), and relative integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).
   Results We identified two proteins associated with incident CHD in individuals with and 29 in those without baseline T2D, respectively. Six of these proteins are novel candidates for incident CHD. MR suggested a potential causal role for hepatocyte growth factor in CHD development. The developed four-protein-enriched model for individuals with baseline T2D (Delta C-index: 0.017; cfNRI: 0.253; IDI: 0.051) and the 12-protein-enriched model for individuals without baseline T2D (Delta C-index: 0.054; cfNRI: 0.462; IDI: 0.024) consistently improved CHD prediction in the discovery cohort, while in the validation cohort, significant improvements were only observed for selected performance measures (with T2D: cfNRI: 0.633; without T2D: Delta C-index: 0.038; cfNRI: 0.465).
   Conclusions This study identified novel protein biomarkers associated with incident CHD in individuals with and without T2D and reaffirmed previously reported protein candidates. These findings enhance our understanding of CHD pathophysiology and provide potential targets for prevention and treatment.

AB  - BackgroundProtein biomarkers may contribute to the identification of vulnerable subgroups for premature mortality. This study aimed to investigate the association of plasma proteins with all-cause and cause-specific mortality among individuals with and without baseline type 2 diabetes (T2D) and evaluate their impact on the prediction of all-cause mortality in two prospective Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) studies.MethodsThe discovery cohort comprised 1545 participants (median follow-up 15.6 years; 244 with T2D: 116 total, 62 cardiovascular, 31 cancer-related and 23 other-cause deaths; 1301 without T2D: 321 total, 114 cardiovascular, 120 cancer-related and 87 other-cause deaths). The validation cohort comprised 1031 participants (median follow-up 6.9 years; 203 with T2D: 76 total, 45 cardiovascular, 19 cancer-related and 12 other-cause deaths; 828 without T2D: 169 total, 74 cardiovascular, 39 cancer-related and 56 other-cause deaths). We used Cox regression to examine associations of 233 plasma proteins with all-cause and cause-specific mortality and Lasso regression to construct prediction models for all-cause mortality stratifying by baseline T2D. C-index, category-free net reclassification index (cfNRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were conducted to evaluate the predictive performance of built prediction models.ResultsThirty-five and 62 proteins, with 29 overlapping, were positively associated with all-cause mortality in the group with and without T2D, respectively. Out of these, in the group with T2D, 35, eight, and 26 were positively associated with cardiovascular, cancer-related, and other-cause mortality, while in the group without T2D, 55, 41, and 47 were positively associated with respective cause-specific outcomes in the pooled analysis of both cohorts. Regulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) transport and uptake by IGF-binding proteins emerged as a unique pathway enriched for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with T2D. The combined model containing the selected proteins (five and 12 proteins, with four overlapping, in the group with and without T2D, respectively) and clinical risk factors improved the prediction of all-cause mortality by C-index, cfNRI, and IDI.ConclusionsThis study uncovered shared and unique mortality-related proteins in persons with and without T2D and emphasized the role of proteins in improving the prediction of mortality in different T2D subgroups.

AB  - Background: Urine proteome analysis is rapidly emerging as a tool for diagnosis and prognosis in disease states. For diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy (DN), urinary proteome analysis was successfully applied in a pilot study. The validity of the previously established proteomic biomarkers with respect to the diagnostic and prognostic potential was assessed on a separate set of patients recruited at three different European centers. In this case-control study of 148 Caucasian patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and duration >= 5 years, cases of DN were defined as albuminuria >300 mg/d and diabetic retinopathy (n = 66). Controls were matched for gender and diabetes duration (n = 82).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Proteome analysis was performed blinded using high-resolution capillary electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry (CE-MS). Data were evaluated employing the previously developed model for DN. Upon unblinding, the model for DN showed 93.8% sensitivity and 91.4% specificity, with an AUC of 0.948 (95% CI 0.898-0.978). Of 65 previously identified peptides, 60 were significantly different between cases and controls of this study. In <10% of cases and controls classification by proteome analysis not entirely resulted in the expected clinical outcome. Analysis of patient's subsequent clinical course revealed later progression to DN in some of the false positive classified DN control patients.
   Conclusions: These data provide the first independent confirmation that profiling of the urinary proteome by CE-MS can adequately identify subjects with DN, supporting the generalizability of this approach. The data further establish urinary collagen fragments as biomarkers for diabetes-induced renal damage that may serve as earlier and more specific biomarkers than the currently used urinary albumin.

AB  - Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is an important cause of renal dysfunction and the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Diabetic nephropathy is also associated with an increased risk of vascular disease and patient mortality. Aggressive management of hypertension to reduce microalbuminuria, together with tight glycaemic control are important therapeutic strategies for renal and vascular disease prevention in T2D. The main pathophysiological mechanisms associated with diabetic nephropathy result from activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), protein kinase C pathway, pro-inflammatory cytokines and various growth factors. Angiotensin II and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) are two important molecular mediators. The production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and increased oxidative stress further exacerbates renal injury. These molecular changes within the renal tissue result in mesangial expansion, increased extracellular matrix deposition and an alteration in podocyte structure and function. Therapeutic targeting of these molecular pathways is an important area of translational research in diabetes. The elucidation of new genetic associations and proteomic biomarkers of diabetic kidney disease will also assist in the identification and treatment of high-risk patients. This review article will discuss both the molecular and clinical aspects of diabetic nephropathy, providing a bench-to-bedside research perspective to potential new therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Insulin resistance (IR) is a precursor of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and improved risk prediction and understanding of the pathogenesis are needed. We used a novel high-throughput 92-protein assay to identify circulating biomarkers for HOMA of IR in two cohorts of community residents without diabetes (n = 1,367) (mean age 73 +/- 3.6 years). Adjusted linear regression identified cathepsin D and confirmed six proteins (leptin, renin, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1ra], hepatocyte growth factor, fatty acid-binding protein 4, and tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA]) as IR biomarkers. Mendelian randomization analysis indicated a positive causal effect of IR on t-PA concentrations. Two biomarkers, IL-1ra (hazard ratio [HR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59) and t-PA (HR 1.30, 1.02-1.65) were associated with incident T2D, and t-PA predicted 5-year transition to hyperglycemia (odds ratio 1.30, 95% CI 1.02-1.65). Additional adjustment for fasting glucose rendered both coefficients insignificant and revealed an association between renin and T2D (HR 0.79, 0.62-0.99). LASSO regression suggested a risk model including IL-1ra, t-PA, and the Framingham Offspring Study T2D score, but prediction improvement was nonsignificant (difference in C-index 0.02, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.12) over the T2D score only. In conclusion, proteomic blood profiling indicated cathepsin D as a new IR biomarker and suggested a causal effect of IR on t-PA.

AB  - Bariatric surgery restores glucose tolerance in many, but not all, severely obese subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aimed to evaluate the plasma protein profiles associated with the T2D remission after obesity surgery. We recruited seventeen women with severe obesity submitted to bariatric procedures, including six non-diabetic patients and eleven patients with T2D. After surgery, diabetes remitted in 7 of the 11 patients with T2D. Plasma protein profiles at baseline and 6 months after bariatric surgery were analyzed by two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight/time-of-flight coupled to mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS). Remission of T2D following bariatric procedures was associated with changes in alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (SERPINA 3, p < 0.05), alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M, p < 0.005), ceruloplasmin (CP, p < 0.05), fibrinogen beta chain (FBG, p < 0.05), fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG, p < 0.05), gelsolin (GSN, p < 0.05), prothrombin (F2, p < 0.05), and serum amyloid p-component (APCS, p < 0.05). The resolution of diabetes after bariatric surgery is associated with specific changes in the plasma proteomic profiles of proteins involved in acute-phase response, fibrinolysis, platelet degranulation, and blood coagulation, providing a pathophysiological basis for the study of their potential use as biomarkers of the surgical remission of T2D in a larger series of severely obese patients.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of diabetes and its complications, such as cardiovascular and kidney disease, remains a huge burden globally. Identification of biomarkers for the screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of diabetes and its complications and better understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the development and progression of diabetes can facilitate individualized prevention and treatment. With the advancement of analytical techniques, metabolomics can identify and quantify multiple biomarkers simultaneously in a high-throughput manner. Providing information on underlying metabolic pathways, metabolomics can further identify mechanisms of diabetes and its progression. The application of metabolomics in epidemiological studies have identified novel biomarkers for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications, such as branched-chain amino acids, metabolites of phenylalanine, metabolites involved in energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Metabolomics have also been applied to explore the potential pathways modulated by medications. Investigating diabetes using a systems biology approach by integrating metabolomics with other omics data, such as genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and clinical data can present a comprehensive metabolic network and facilitate causal inference. In this regard, metabolomics can deepen the molecular understanding, help identify potential therapeutic targets, and improve the prevention and management of T2D and its complications. The current review focused on metabolomic biomarkers for kidney and cardiovascular disease in T2D identified from epidemiological studies, and will also provide a brief overview on metabolomic investigations for T2D.

AB  - Context: Humans respond profoundly to changes in diet, while nutrition and environment have a great impact on population health. It is therefore important to deeply characterize the human nutritional responses.
   Objective: Endocrine parameters and the metabolome of human plasma are rapidly responding to acute nutritional interventions such as caloric restriction or a glucose challenge. It is less well understood whether the plasma proteome would be equally dynamic, and whether it could be a source of corresponding biomarkers.
   Methods: We used high-throughput mass spectrometry to determine changes in the plasma proteome of i) 10 healthy, young, male individuals in response to 2 days of acute caloric restriction followed by refeeding; ii) 200 individuals of the Ely epidemiological study before and after a glucose tolerance test at 4 time points (0, 30, 60, 120 minutes); and iii) 200 random individuals from the Generation Scotland study. We compared the proteomic changes detected with metabolome data and endocrine parameters.
   Results: Both caloric restriction and the glucose challenge substantially impacted the plasma proteome. Proteins responded across individuals or in an individual-specific manner. We identified nutrient-responsive plasma proteins that correlate with changes in the metabolome, as well as with endocrine parameters. In particular, our study highlights the role of apolipoprotein C1 (APOC1), a small, understudied apolipoprotein that was affected by caloric restriction and dominated the response to glucose consumption and differed in abundance between individuals with and without type 2 diabetes.
   Conclusion: Our study identifies APOC1 as a dominant nutritional responder in humans and highlights the interdependency of acute nutritional response proteins and the endocrine system.

AB  - Purpose Objective markers of usual diet are of interest as alternative or validating tools in nutritional epidemiology research. The main purpose of the work was to assess whether saliva protein composition can reflect dietary habits in older adults, and how type 2 diabetes impacted on the saliva-diet correlates. Methods 214 participants were selected from 2 European cohorts of community-dwelling older adults (3C-Bordeaux and Seniors-ENRICA-2), using a case-control design nested in each cohort. Cases were individuals with type 2 diabetes. Dietary information was obtained using the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). Saliva was successfully obtained from 211 subjects, and its proteome analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results The relative abundance of 246 saliva proteins was obtained across all participants. The salivary proteome differed depending on the intake level of some food groups (especially vegetables, fruits, sweet snacks and red meat), in a diabetic status- and cohort-specific manner. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis suggested that some biological processes were consistently affected by diet across cohorts, for example enhanced platelet degranulation in high consumers of sweet snacks. Minimal models were then fitted to predict dietary variables by sociodemographic, clinical and salivary proteome variables. For the food group << sweet snacks >>, selected salivary proteins contributed to the predictive model and improved its performance in the Seniors-ENRICA-2 cohort and when both cohorts were combined. Conclusion Saliva proteome composition of elderly individuals can reflect some aspects of dietary patterns.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association of four bone metabolism biomarkers (osteoprotegerin, osteopontin, sclerostin, and osteocalcin) with cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) was a randomized clinical trial evaluating the cardiovascular (CV) safety and efficacy of once-weekly exenatide for patients with T2D. Candidate biomarker data were selected from proteomic profiling performed at baseline and 12 months after randomization samples by SomaScan assay in 5,473 trial participants. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (major cardiovascular events [MACE]). Cox proportional hazards models controlling for confounders were used for time-to-event analyses to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CI for a 1 SD increase in the biomarker concentrations. RESULTS The primary outcome occurred in 813 participants (14.9%). Higher levels of osteoprotegerin (HR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03-1.20; P = 0.0047) and osteopontin (HR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02-1.18; P = 0.0095) were associated with an increased risk of MACE. The addition of osteoprotegerin and osteopontin to a clinical predictive model containing traditional CV risk factors provided minimal incremental value for MACE prediction (C-index 0.629 vs. 0.638; likelihood ratio test P < 0.001). Osteocalcin and sclerostin were not associated with MACE. Osteocalcin had a nonlinear association with all-cause death and with CV death. CONCLUSIONS Higher levels of osteoprotegerin and osteopontin are associated with an increased risk of CV events in people with T2D, supporting the hypothesis that pathways involved in bone metabolism play a role in CV disease.

AB  - Background Glomerular endothelial dysfunction and neoangiogenesis have long been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, the specific molecular pathways contributing to these processes in the early stages of DKD are not well understood. Our recent transcriptomic profiling of glomerular endothelial cells identified a number of proangiogenic genes that were upregulated in diabetic mice, including leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1). LRG1 was previously shown to promote neovascularization in mouse models of ocular disease by potentiating endothelial TGF-beta/activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) signaling. However, LRG1's role in the kidney, particularly in the setting of DKD, has been unclear.
   Methods We analyzed expression of LRG1 mRNA in glomeruli of diabetic kidneys and assessed its localization by RNA in situ hybridization. We examined the effects of genetic ablation of Lrg1 on DKD progression in unilaterally nephrectomized, streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice at 12 and 20 weeks after diabetes induction. We also assessed whether plasma LRG1 was associated with renal outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes.
   Results LRG1 localized predominantly to glomerular endothelial cells, and its expression was elevated in the diabetic kidneys. LRG1 ablation markedly attenuated diabetes-induced glomerular angiogenesis, podocyte loss, and the development of diabetic glomerulopathy. These improvements were associated with reduced ALK1-Smad1/5/8 activation in glomeruli of diabetic mice. Moreover, increased plasma LRG1 was associated with worse renal outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes.
   Conclusions These findings identify LRG1 as a potential novel pathogenic mediator of diabetic glomerular neoangiogenesis and a risk factor in DKD progression.

AB  - Purpose: To explore the vitreous humor proteome from type 2 diabetes subjects with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in the Indian population. Methods: We performed mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative analysis of vitreous proteome of PDR (n = 13) and idiopathic macular hole (IMH; control) subjects (n = 14). Nine samples of PDR and 10 samples of IMH were pooled as case and control, respectively, and compared. Four samples each of PDR and IMH were analyzed individually without pooling to validate the results of the pooled analysis. Comparative quantification was performed using Scaffold software which calculated the fold changes of differential expression. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using DAVID and STRING software. Results: We identified 469 proteins in PDR and 517 proteins in IMH vitreous, with an overlap of 172 proteins. Also, 297 unique proteins were identified in PDR and 345 in IMH. In PDR vitreous, 37 proteins were upregulated (P < 0.05) and 19 proteins were downregulated compared to IMH. Protein distribution analysis clearly demonstrated a separation of protein expression in PDR and IMH. Significantly upregulated proteins included fibrinogen gamma chain, fibrinogen beta chain, and carbonic anhydrase 1 and downregulated proteins included alpha-1-antitrypsin, retinol-binding protein 3, neuroserpin, cystatin C, carboxypeptidase E and cathepsin-D. Conclusion: Diabetic retinopathy pathogenesis involves proteins which belong to inflammation, visual transduction, and extracellular matrix pathways. Validation-based experiments using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or western blotting are needed to establish cause and effect relationships of these proteins to the disease state, to develop them as biomarkers or drug molecules.

AB  - Renal dysfunction, a major complication of type 2 diabetes, can be predicted from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and protein markers such as albumin concentration. Urinary protein biomarkers may be used to monitor or predict patient status. Urine samples were selected from patients enrolled in the retrospective diabetic kidney disease (DKD) study, including 35 with good and 19 with poor prognosis. After removal of albumin and immunoglobulin, the remaining proteins were reduced, alkylated, digested, and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively with a nano LC-MS platform. Each protein was identified, and its concentration normalized to that of creatinine. A prognostic model of DKD was formulated based on the adjusted quantities of each protein in the two groups. Of 1296 proteins identified in the 54 urine samples, 66 were differentially abundant in the two groups (area under the curve (AUC):p-value < 0.05), but none showed significantly better performance than albumin. To improve the predictive power by multivariate analysis, five proteins (ACP2, CTSA, GM2A, MUC1, and SPARCL1) were selected as significant by an AUC-based random forest method. The application of two classifiers-support vector machine and random forest-showed that the multivariate model performed better than univariate analysis of mucin-1 (AUC: 0.935 vs. 0.791) and albumin (AUC: 1.0 vs. 0.722). The urinary proteome can reflect kidney function directly and can predict the prognosis of patients with chronic kidney dysfunction. Classification based on five urinary proteins may better predict the prognosis of DKD patients than urinary albumin concentration or eGFR.

AB  - Background and aims: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLC30A8 gene have been recognized as contributing to type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility and colorectal cancer. This study aims to predict the structural stability, and functional impacts on variations in non- synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in the human SLC30A8 gene using various computational techniques. Materials and methods: Several in silico tools, including SIFT, Predict-SNP, SNPs&GO, &GO, MAPP, SNAP2, PhD-SNP, PANTHER, PolyPhen-1,PolyPhen-2, I-Mutant 2.0, and MUpro, have been used in our study. Results: After data analysis, out of 336 missenses, the eight nsSNPs, namely R138Q, I141N, W136G, I349N, L303R, E140A, W306C, and L308Q, were discovered by ConSurf to be in highly conserved regions, which could affect the stability of their proteins. Project HOPE determines any significant molecular effects on the structure and function of eight mutated proteins and the three-dimensional (3D) structures of these proteins. The two pharmacologically significant compounds, Luzonoid B and Roseoside demonstrate strong binding affinity to the mutant proteins, and they are more efficient in inhibiting them than the typical SLC30A8 protein using Autodock Vina and Chimera. Increased binding affinity to mutant SLC30A8 proteins has been determined not to influence drug resistance. Ultimately, the Kaplan-Meier plotter study revealed that alterations in SLC30A8 gene expression notably affect the survival rates of patients with various cancer types. Conclusion: Finally, the study found eight highly deleterious missense nsSNPs in the SLC30A8 gene that can be helpful for further proteomic and genomic studies for T2D and colorectal cancer diagnosis. These findings also pave the way for personalized treatments using biomarkers and more effective healthcare strategies.

AB  - Background. Studies in the past decade have reported many novel biomarkers for predicting the new-onset or progression risk of renal dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) based on the genomic, metabolomic, and proteomic technologies. These novel predictive markers, however, are difficult to be widely used in clinical practice over the short term due to their high technology content, instability, and high cost. This study was aimed at evaluating the associations of clinical features and six traditional renal markers with the short-term risk of new-onset renal dysfunction in patients with T2D. Methods. This study involved 213 participants with T2D and normal renal function at baseline. The baseline levels of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), alpha-1-microglobulin-to-creatinine ratio (A1MCR), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin-to-creatinine ratio, transferrin-to-creatinine ratio (UTRF/Cr), and retinol-binding protein-to-creatinine ratio (URBP/Cr) were analyzed. Multivariate logistic models were established and validated. Results. During the two-year follow-up period, 23.01% participants progressed to renal dysfunction. The basal levels of ACR, A1MCR, UTRF/Cr, and URBP/Cr were the independent risk factors of new-onset renal dysfunction (P < 0.05). Several logistic models incorporating clinical characteristics and these renal markers were constructed for predicting the short-term risk of new-onset renal dysfunction. Comparatively, the model including age, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypertension, ACR, A1MCR, UTRF/Cr, and URBP/Cr levels at baseline had the highest potential (C - index = 0.785, P < 0.001). This model was validated using the K -fold cross-validation method; the accuracy was 0.815 +/- 0.013 in training sets and 0.784 +/- 0.019 in validation sets, indicating a good consistency for predicting the new-onset renal dysfunction risk. Finally, a nomogram based on this model was constructed to provide a quantitative tool to assess the individualized risk of short-term new-onset renal dysfunction. Conclusion. The model incorporating these markers and clinical features may have a high potential to predict the short-term risk of new-onset renal dysfunction.

AB  - Glycation and glycoxidation of proteins and peptides have been intensively studied and are considered as reliable diagnostic biomarkers of hyperglycemia and early stages of type II diabetes. However, glucose can also react with primary amino groups present in other cellular components, such as aminophospholipids (aminoPLs). Although it is proposed that glycated aminoPLs can induce many cellular responses and contribute to the development and progression of diabetes, the routes of their formation and their biological roles are only partially revealed. The same is true for the influence of glucose-derived modifications on the biophysical properties of PLs. Here we studied structural, signaling, and biophysical properties of glycated and glycoxidized phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). By combining high resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy it was possible to deduce the structures of several intermediates indicating an oxidative cleavage of the Amadori product yielding glycoxidized PEs including advanced glycation end products, such as carboxyethyl- and carboxymethylethanolamines. The pro-oxidative role of glycated PEs was demonstrated and further associated with several cellular responses including activation of NIFKB signaling pathways. Label free proteomics indicated significant alterations in proteins regulating cellular metabolisms. Finally, the biophysical properties of PL membranes changed significantly upon PE glycation, such as melting temperature (Tn,), membrane surface charge, and ion transport across the phospholipid bilayer.

AB  - Background: Physical activity has been associated with preventing the development of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, our understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remains incomplete and good biomarkers to objectively assess physical activity are lacking.
   Methods: We analyzed 3072 serum proteins in 26 men, normal weight or overweight, undergoing 12 weeks of a combined strength and endurance exercise intervention. We estimated insulin sensitivity with hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, maximum oxygen uptake, muscle strength, and used MRI/MRS to evaluate body composition and organ fat depots. Muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were used for mRNA sequencing. Additional association analyses were performed in samples from up to 47,747 individuals in the UK Biobank, as well as using two-sample Mendelian randomization and mice models.
   Results: Following 12 weeks of exercise intervention, we observed significant changes in 283 serum proteins. Notably, 66 of these proteins were elevated in overweight men and positively associated with liver fat before the exercise regimen, but were normalized after exercise. Furthermore, for 19.7 and 12.1% of the exercise-responsive proteins, corresponding changes in mRNA expression levels in muscle and fat, respectively, were shown. The protein CD300LG displayed consistent alterations in blood, muscle, and fat. Serum CD300LG exhibited positive associations with insulin sensitivity, and to angiogenesis-related gene expression in both muscle and fat. Furthermore, serum CD300LG was positively associated with physical activity and negatively associated with glucose levels in the UK Biobank. In this sample, the association between serum CD300LG and physical activity was significantly stronger in men than in women. Mendelian randomization analysis suggested potential causal relationships between levels of serum CD300LG and fasting glucose, 2 hr glucose after an oral glucose tolerance test, and HbA1c. Additionally, Cd300lg responded to exercise in a mouse model, and we observed signs of impaired glucose tolerance in male, but not female, Cd300lg knockout mice.
   Conclusions: Our study identified several novel proteins in serum whose levels change in response to prolonged exercise and were significantly associated with body composition, liver fat, and glucose homeostasis. Serum CD300LG increased with physical activity and is a potential causal link to improved glucose levels. CD300LG may be a promising exercise biomarker and a therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is among the most prevalent endocrinological abnormalities of young females, posing a grave public health challenge to the society. The objective of the present literature review is to analyze the enormous amount of information available by way of numerous multi-omic studies, and to explore a meaningful relationship between various factors such as genetic, proteomic, environmental etc. to understand the multifactorial metabolic disorder in a proper manner. Detailed literature search was done in various science article repositories and biomedical databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, BioMed Central, Embase etc. by using several keywords in whole gamut of combinations. PCOS is a heritable disease. It manifests as a result of a combination of several intricately inter-linked symptoms such as anovulation, obesity, type II diabetes, hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries etc., the last one being the main manifestation of the disease, thus leading to infertility among several other complications. Such a multifactorial metabolic disorder with extreme symptomatic heterogeneity cannot be fully explained solely based on symptoms or genetic variations; thus, giving some space of thought to other factors such as epigenetic, microbiomic factors etc. playing a role in the causation of the disease. The present scientific survey of literature extensively reviews various aspects of PCOS by critically looking into the vast multi-omic data, and concluded with suggesting treatment options as well as lifestyle changes required to deal with the psychological/ emotional impacts of the condition on affected women.

AB  - A common complication of both type I and type II diabetes is nephropathy, characterized by accumulation of extracellular matrix in the glomerular mesangium. This indicates a central role of mesangial cells in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy. Using the proteomic approach, it was earlier elucidated in a rat model that the proteasome subunit-alpha type-6 protein (PSMA6) is suppressed in the renal cortex in nephropathic kidney. However, the underlying mechanism effecting suppression of PSMA6 protein in the renal cortex is not yet known. Twenty diabetic patients were enrolled and the expression level of PSMA6 in them was detected by immunohistochemistry. The protein and mRNA expression levels of PSMA6 in NRK-52E cells under high glucose condition were determined by Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. Dual luciferase assay was used to detect the relationship of PSMA6 and miR-4490. Our results show that PSMA6 protein is down-regulated in patients with diabetic nephropathy compared with healthy control. Using the NRK-52E cell line cultured under high glucose condition as an in vitro model of diabetic nephropathy, we show that loss of PSMA6 protein expression occured independent of changes the in PSMA6 mRNA expression. We next elucidate that PSMA6 mRNA is post-transcriptionally regulated by the microRNA (miRNA)-4490, whose expression is inversely correlated to PSMA6 protein expression. Using reporter assays we show that PSMA6 is a direct target of the miR-4490. Exogenous manipulation of miR-4490 levels modulated expression of PSMA6, indicating that miR-4490 can be tested as a biomarker for nephropathy in diabetic patients.

AB  - Aims/hypothesisPeople with type 2 diabetes are heterogeneous in their disease trajectory, with some progressing more quickly to insulin initiation than others. Although classical biomarkers such as age, HbA1c and diabetes duration are associated with glycaemic progression, it is unclear how well such variables predict insulin initiation or requirement and whether newly identified markers have added predictive value.MethodsIn two prospective cohort studies as part of IMI-RHAPSODY, we investigated whether clinical variables and three types of molecular markers (metabolites, lipids, proteins) can predict time to insulin requirement using different machine learning approaches (lasso, ridge, GRridge, random forest). Clinical variables included age, sex, HbA1c, HDL-cholesterol and C-peptide. Models were run with unpenalised clinical variables (i.e. always included in the model without weights) or penalised clinical variables, or without clinical variables. Model development was performed in one cohort and the model was applied in a second cohort. Model performance was evaluated using Harrel's C statistic.ResultsOf the 585 individuals from the Hoorn Diabetes Care System (DCS) cohort, 69 required insulin during follow-up (1.0-11.4 years); of the 571 individuals in the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (GoDARTS) cohort, 175 required insulin during follow-up (0.3-11.8 years). Overall, the clinical variables and proteins were selected in the different models most often, followed by the metabolites. The most frequently selected clinical variables were HbA1c (18 of the 36 models, 50%), age (15 models, 41.2%) and C-peptide (15 models, 41.2%). Base models (age, sex, BMI, HbA1c) including only clinical variables performed moderately in both the DCS discovery cohort (C statistic 0.71 [95% CI 0.64, 0.79]) and the GoDARTS replication cohort (C 0.71 [95% CI 0.69, 0.75]). A more extensive model including HDL-cholesterol and C-peptide performed better in both cohorts (DCS, C 0.74 [95% CI 0.67, 0.81]; GoDARTS, C 0.73 [95% CI 0.69, 0.77]). Two proteins, lactadherin and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor, were most consistently selected and slightly improved model performance.Conclusions/interpretationUsing machine learning approaches, we show that insulin requirement risk can be modestly well predicted by predominantly clinical variables. Inclusion of molecular markers improves the prognostic performance beyond that of clinical variables by up to 5%. Such prognostic models could be useful for identifying people with diabetes at high risk of progressing quickly to treatment intensification.Data availabilitySummary statistics of lipidomic, proteomic and metabolomic data are available from a Shiny dashboard at https://rhapdata-app.vital-it.ch.

AB  - Smoking is one of the leading preventable causes of disease, disability, and death in the USA and leads to more than 400,000 preventable deaths per year. Nicotine is the major alkaloid present in tobacco smoke, and many of the negative effects of smoking are attributed to nicotine. Nicotine is not only the addictive component of tobacco smoke, but also highly associated with carcinogenesis and induces oxidative stress. Furthermore, the administration of nicotine via subcutaneous mini-osmotic pumps or by injection is an established method in preclinical studies for this area of research. Thus, preclinical research on the negative effects of tobacco smoke and tobacco addiction has focused primarily on the effects of nicotine. However, there are over 4,500 components found in tobacco smoke, many of which are highly toxic. Other components may also contribute to the addictive properties of tobacco smoke. Furthermore, the negative effects of tobacco smoke are not isolated to the smoker but can have negative effects to those exposed to the secondhand smoke (SHS) stream. SHS exposure is the third leading cause of preventable death. Approximately 38,000 deaths per year are attributed to SHS exposure in the USA. SHS exposure increases the risk of heart disease by approximately 30% and is associated with increased risk of stroke, cancer, type II diabetes, as well as pulmonary disease. Thus, methods of administering tobacco smoke in a controlled environment will further our understanding of tobacco addiction and the role tobacco smoke in other disease states. Moreover, combining smoke exposure with proteomics can lead to the discovery of biomarkers that can be potentially useful tools in screening, early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases caused by SHS.

AB  - The biology underlying the connection between social relationships and health is largely unknown. Here, leveraging data from 42,062 participants across 2,920 plasma proteins in the UK Biobank, we characterized the proteomic signatures of social isolation and loneliness through proteome-wide association study and protein co-expression network analysis. Proteins linked to these constructs were implicated in inflammation, antiviral responses and complement systems. More than half of these proteins were prospectively linked to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and mortality during a 14 year follow-up. Moreover, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis suggested causal relationships from loneliness to five proteins, with two proteins (ADM and ASGR1) further supported by colocalization. These MR-identified proteins (GFRA1, ADM, FABP4, TNFRSF10A and ASGR1) exhibited broad associations with other blood biomarkers, as well as volumes in brain regions involved in interoception and emotional and social processes. Finally, the MR-identified proteins partly mediated the relationship between loneliness and cardiovascular diseases, stroke and mortality. The exploration of the peripheral physiology through which social relationships influence morbidity and mortality is timely and has potential implications for public health.

AB  - Analyzing correlated high-dimensional data is a challenging problem in genomics, proteomics, and other related areas. For example, it is important to identify significant genetic pathway effects associated with biomarkers in which a gene pathway is a set of genes that functionally works together to regulate a certain biological process. A pathway-based analysis can detect a subtle change in expression level that cannot be found using a gene-based analysis. Here, we refer to pathway as a set and gene as an element in a set. However, it is challenging to select automatically which pathways are highly associated to the outcome when there are multiple pathways. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric multikernel regression model to study the effects of fixed covariates (e.g., clinical variables) and sets of elements (e.g., pathways of genes) to address a problem of detecting signal sets associated to biomarkers. We model the unknown high-dimension functions of multi-sets via multiple Gaussian kernel machines to consider the possibility that elements within the same set interact with each other. Hence, our variable set selection can be considered a Gaussian process set selection. We develop our Gaussian process set selection under the Bayesian variance component-selection framework. We incorporate prior knowledge for structural sets by imposing an Ising prior on the model. Our approach can be easily applied in high-dimensional spaces where the sample size is smaller than the number of variables. An efficient variational Bayes algorithm is developed. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach through simulation studies and through a type II diabetes genetic-pathway analysis.

AB  - Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an inherited monogenic type of diabetes. Genetic mutations in MODY often cause nonsynonymous changes that directly lead to the functional distortion of proteins and the pathological consequences. Herein, we proposed that the inherited mutations found in a MODY family could cause a disturbance of protein abundance, specifically in serum. The serum samples were collected from a Uyghur MODY family through three generations, and the serum proteins after depletion treatment were examined by quantitative proteomics to characterize the MODY-related serum proteins followed by verification using target quantification of proteomics. A total of 32 serum proteins were preliminarily identified as the MODY-related. Further verification test toward the individual samples demonstrated the 12 candidates with the significantly different abundance in the MODY patients. A comparison of the 12 proteins among the sera of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, MODY, and healthy subjects was conducted and revealed a protein signature related with MODY composed of the serum proteins such as SERPINA7, APOC4, LPA, C6, and F5.

AB  - Simple Summary The accumulation of senescent cells is now widely known to be a driver of aging and many age-related pathologies, such as neurodegeneration and type 2 diabetes, among others. Targeting senescent cells for selective removal or altering the proteins they release are promising therapeutic strategies against age-related diseases. However, the biology of senescent cells is complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous. In order to better identify pathology-driving senescent cells and develop therapies to alter their complex biology or drive them toward cell death, a detailed and comprehensive understanding of senescence-associated proteins and the mechanisms that enable senescent cells to evade cell death is required. Major developments in proteomic workflows over the past decade have enabled an increasingly comprehensive, quantitative, and specific molecular profiling and interrogation of cellular mechanisms. In this review, we discuss the current state of translational senescence research and how modern proteomic technologies, particularly mass spectrometry-based proteomics, can accelerate our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that drive senescence and robustly probe the proteomic phenotypes of heterogenous populations of senescent cells. We will focus on how these fundamental biological insights will ultimately accelerate the development of senescence-targeting therapies, or senotherapeutics.Abstract Cellular senescence is a state of irreversible growth arrest with profound phenotypic changes, including the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescent cell accumulation contributes to aging and many pathologies including chronic inflammation, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Targeted removal of senescent cells in preclinical models promotes health and longevity, suggesting that the selective elimination of senescent cells is a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating a myriad of age-related pathologies in humans. However, moving senescence-targeting drugs (senotherapeutics) into the clinic will require therapeutic targets and biomarkers, fueled by an improved understanding of the complex and dynamic biology of senescent cell populations and their molecular profiles, as well as the mechanisms underlying the emergence and maintenance of senescence cells and the SASP. Advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies and workflows have the potential to address these needs. Here, we review the state of translational senescence research and how proteomic approaches have added to our knowledge of senescence biology to date. Further, we lay out a roadmap from fundamental biological discovery to the clinical translation of senotherapeutic approaches through the development and application of emerging proteomic technologies, including targeted and untargeted proteomic approaches, bottom-up and top-down methods, stability proteomics, and surfaceomics. These technologies are integral for probing the cellular composition and dynamics of senescent cells and, ultimately, the development of senotype-specific biomarkers and senotherapeutics (senolytics and senomorphics). This review aims to highlight emerging areas and applications of proteomics that will aid in exploring new senescent cell biology and the future translation of senotherapeutics.

TI  - Evaluating the Causal Effect of Circulating Proteome on Glycemic Traits: Evidence From Mendelian Randomization
T2  - DIABETES
AB  - Exploring the mechanisms underlying abnormal glycemic traits is important for deciphering type 2 diabetes and characterizing novel drug targets. This study aimed to decipher the causal associations of circulating proteins with fasting glucose (FG), 2-h glucose after an oral glucose challenge (2hGlu), fasting insulin (FI), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) using large-scale proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Genetic data on plasma proteomes were obtained from 10 proteomic genome-wide association studies. Both cis-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) and cis + trans-pQTLs MR analyses were conducted. Bayesian colocalization, Steiger filtering analysis, assessment of protein-altering variants, and mapping expression QTLs to pQTLs were performed to investigate the reliability of the MR findings. Protein-protein interaction, pathway enrichment analysis, and evaluation of drug targets were performed. Thirty-three proteins were identified with causal effects on FG, FI, or HbA1c but not 2hGlu in the cis-pQTL analysis, and 93 proteins had causal effects on glycemic traits in the cis + trans-pQTLs analysis. Most proteins were either considered druggable or drug targets. In conclusion, many novel circulating protein biomarkers were identified to be causally associated with glycemic traits. These biomarkers enhance the understanding of molecular etiology and provide insights into the screening, monitoring, and treatment of diabetes.

AB  - The db/db mouse is a widely used preclinical model in diabetes research. Recent studies have shown that these mice also display aspects of psychosis and depression-like behaviors as seen in some psychiatric disorders. Here, we have performed multiplex immunoassay and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry profiling of the plasma and brain samples from db/db and control mice to identify altered pathways, which could be related to these behavioral abnormalities. This is the first study to carry out profiling of the brain proteome in this model. Plasma from the db/db mice had increased levels of leptin and insulin, decreased levels of peptide YY, glucagon and prolactin and alterations in inflammation-related proteins, compared with control mice. Frontal cortex tissue from the db/db mice showed changes in proteins involved in energy metabolism, cellular structure and neural functioning, and the hippocampus had changes in proteins involved in the same pathways, with additional effects on cellular signalling proteins. The overlap of these findings with effects seen in type 2 diabetes, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and Alzheimer's disease might contribute to a common endophenotype seen in metabolic and neurological disorders.

AB  - The aim of this study was to screen for proteins that are susceptible to glycation under hyperglycemic conditions in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Serum proteins were analyzed by a proteomic approach using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS. Gels were stained with Pro-Q Emerald 488 to analyze the serum glycoproteome, followed by silver nitrate to examine the total serum proteome. Patient sera were divided into four groups according to their microalbuminuria index: type 2 diabetics with normoalbuminuria, microalbuminuria, and overt nephropathy, and healthy subjects. When the HbA1c levels of the diabetic groups were examined, groups with higher HbA1c exhibited higher fructosamine levels, suggesting that the loss of glycemic control affected the glycation of serum proteins. The proteins that became glycated under poor glycemic control were PEDF, apolipoprotein J precursor, hemopexin, immunoglobulin mu heavy chain, and immunoglobulin kappa chain. As albuminuria increased, a marker of kidney damage, the levels of glycated prekallikrein and complement factor C4B3 also increased. The glycated proteins identified in this study may provide the foundation for the development of novel markers of diabetes, hyperglycemia, and diabetic complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE - Diabetic nephropathy is a serious complication of both type I and type 2 diabetes, and, unless arrested, leads to end-stage renal disease. Current diagnosis consists of urine assays of microalbuminuria, which have inadequate specificity and sensitivity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND
   METHODS - We used proteomic analyses to identify novel biomarkers of nephropathy in urine from type 2 diabetic patients with demonstrated normo-, micro-, or macroalbuminuria. Samples were analyzed by fluorescence two-dimensional (2-D) differential in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE), and protein identification was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
   RESULTS - 2-D DIGE analysis of the urinary proteome in diabetes with nephropathy identified 195 protein spots representing 62 unique proteins. These proteins belonged to several functional groups, i.e., cell development, cell organization, defense response, metabolism, an signal transduction. Comparisons between control and diabetic subjects with different stages of renal dysfunction revealed the differential expression of several proteins. Spot volume quantification identified 7 proteins that were progressively upregulated with increasing albuminuria an 4 proteins that exhibited progressive downregulation. The majority of these potential candidate biomarkers were glycoprotems.
   CONCLUSIONS - These data demonstrate the ability of proteomic analyses to reveal potential biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy in urine, an important step forward in advancing accurate diagnosis and our understanding of disease mechanisms.

AB  - Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) affects an estimated 20-40% of type 2 diabetes patients and is among the most prevalent microvascular complications in this patient population, contributing to high morbidity and mortality rates. Currently, changes in albuminuria status are thought to be a primary indicator of the onset or progression of DKD, yet progressive nephropathy and renal impairment can occur in certain diabetic individuals who exhibit normal urinary albumin levels, emphasizing the lack of sensitivity and specificity associated with the use of albuminuria as a biomarker for detecting diabetic kidney disease and predicting DKD risk. According to the study, a non-invasive method for early detection or prediction of DKD may involve combining proteomic analytical techniques such second generation sequencing, mass spectrometry, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and other advanced system biology algorithms. Another category of proteins of relevance may now be provided by renal tissue biomarkers. The establishment of reliable proteomic biomarkers of DKD represents a novel approach to improving the diagnosis, prognostic evaluation, and treatment of affected patients. In the present review, a series of protein biomarkers that have been characterized to date are discussed, offering a theoretical foundation for future efforts to aid patients suffering from this debilitating microvascular complication.

AB  - Obesity is a frightening chronic disease, which has tripled since 1975. It is not expected to slow down staying one of the leading cases of preventable death and resulting in an increased clinical and economic burden. Poor lifestyle choices and excessive intake of "cheap calories" are major contributors to obesity, triggering type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and other comorbidities. Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for development of obesity is essential as it might result in the introducing of anti-obesity targets and early-stage obesity biomarkers, allowing the distinction between metabolic syndromes. The complex nature of this disease, coupled with the phenomenon of metabolically healthy obesity, inspired us to perform data-centric, hypothesis-generating pilot research, aimed to find correlations between parameters of classic clinical blood tests and proteomic profiles of 104 lean and obese subjects. As the result, we assembled patterns of proteins, which presence or absence allows predicting the weight of the patient fairly well. We believe that such proteomic patterns with high prediction power should facilitate the translation of potential candidates into biomarkers of clinical use for early-stage stratification of obesity therapy.

AB  - The general awareness of the importance of peptides in physiology and pathophysiology has increased strongly over the last few years. With worldwide progress in the analysis of whole genomes, the knowledge base in gene sequence and expression data useful for protein and peptide analysis has drastically increased. The medical need for relevant biomarkers is enormous. This is particularly true for the many types of cancer, but other diseases such as Type 2 diabetes also lack useful and adequate diagnostic markers with high specificity and sensitivity. Despite advances in imaging technologies for early detection of diseases, proteomic and peptidomic multiplex techniques have evolved in recent years. This review focuses on the application of peptidomics technologies to peptides in health and disease. Peptidomics technologies provide new opportunities for the detection of low-molecular-weight proteome biomarkers (peptides) by mass spectrometry. Improvements in peptidomics research are based on separation of peptides and/or proteins by their physicochemical properties in combination with mass spectrometric detection, identification and sophisticated bioinformatics tools for data analysis. Therefore, peptidomics technologies offer an opportunity to discover novel biomarkers for diagnosis and management of disease (e.g., prognosis, treatment decision and monitoring response to therapy).

AB  - Gestational diabetes (GDM) is one of the most common complications occurring during pregnancy. Diagnosis is performed by oral glucose tolerance test, but harmonized testing methods and thresholds are still lacking worldwide. Short-term and long-term effects include obesity, type 2 diabetes, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The identification and validation of sensitidve, selective, and robust biomarkers for early diagnosis during the first trimester of pregnancy are required, as well as for the prediction of possible adverse outcomes after birth. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based omics technologies are nowadays the method of choice to characterize various pathologies at a molecular level. Proteomics and metabolomics of GDM were widely investigated in the last 10 years, and various proteins and metabolites were proposed as possible biomarkers. Metallomics of GDM was also reported, but studies are limited in number. The present review focuses on the description of the different analytical methods and MS-based instrumental platforms applied to GDM-related omics studies. Preparation procedures for various biological specimens are described and results are briefly summarized. Generally, only preliminary findings are reported by current studies and further efforts are required to determine definitive GDM biomarkers.

AB  - Using global liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based proteomics analyses, we identified 24 serum proteins that were significantly variant between those with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and healthy controls. Functionally, these proteins represent innate immune responses, the activation cascade of complement, inflammatory responses, and blood coagulation. Targeted verification analyses were performed on 52 surrogate peptides representing these proteins, with serum samples from an antibody standardization program cohort of 100 healthy control and 50 type 1 diabetic subjects. 16 peptides were verified as having very good discriminating power, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve >= 0.8. Further validation with blinded serum samples from an independent cohort (10 healthy control and 10 type 1 diabetics) demonstrated that peptides from platelet basic protein and C1 inhibitor achieved both 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for classification of samples. The disease specificity of these proteins was assessed using sera from 50 age-matched type 2 diabetic individuals, and a subset of proteins, C1 inhibitor in particular, were exceptionally good discriminators between these two forms of diabetes. The panel of biomarkers distinguishing those with T1D from healthy controls and those with type 2 diabetes suggests that dysregulated innate immune responses may be associated with the development of this disorder.

   We will summarize recent epidemiological observations on the risk for overt diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in nonproteinuric patients, will focus on novel studies based on a proteomic biomarker of DKD and will discuss the possibility of preventing the progression of DKD in nonproteinuric patients by sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.
   Recent findings
   Although less frequently than in type 2 diabetes, DKD may develop also in nonproteinuric type 1 diabetes. However, the progression rate to kidney failure in nonproteinuric diabetic people is much lower than in proteinuric ones. A new proteomic biomarker, the chronic kidney disease (CKD) 273, reliably predicts the risk of incident micro and macroalbuminuria and of CKD in nonalbuminuric diabetic people. SGLT2 inhibition markedly reduces albuminuria in macro and microalbuminuric patients and discernibly mitigates albumin excretion also in those with albuminuria in the normal range.
   Summary
   Studies focusing on risk factors for DKD in nonproteinuric patients are a clinical research priority. The CKD273 classifier is a promising biomarker for the early identification of nonproteinuric patients at high risk for progressive DKD. Empagliflozin and SGLT2 inhibitors may have a favorable impact on the progression of DKD in nonalbuminuric diabetic people, a hypothesis to be tested in specific clinical trials.

AB  - Proteomics has been used to study type 2 diabetes, but the majority of available data are from White participants. Here, we extend prior work by analyzing a large cohort of self-identified African Americans in the Jackson Heart Study (n = 1,313). We found 325 proteins associated with incident diabetes after adjusting for age, sex, and sample batch (false discovery rate q < 0.05) measured using a single-stranded DNA aptamer affinity-based method on fasting plasma samples. A subset was independent of established markers of diabetes development pathways, such as adiposity, glycemia, and/or insulin resistance, suggesting potential novel biological processes associated with disease development. Thirty-six associations remained significant after additional adjustments for BMI, fasting plasma glucose, cholesterol levels, hypertension, statin use, and renal function. Twelve associations, including the top associations of complement factor H, formimidoyltransferase cyclodeaminase, serine/threonine-protein kinase 17B, and high-mobility group protein B1, were replicated in a meta-analysis of two self-identified White cohorts-the Framingham Heart Study and the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study-supporting the generalizability of these biomarkers. A selection of these diabetes-associated proteins also improved risk prediction. Thus, we uncovered both novel and broadly generalizable associations by studying a diverse population, providing a more complete understanding of the diabetes-associated proteome.

AB  - Target biomarkers for H-2 at both the protein and genome levels are still unclear. In this study, quantitative proteomics acquired from a mouse model were first analyzed. At the same time, functional pathway analysis helped identify functional pathways at the protein level. Then, bioinformatics on mRNA sequencing data were conducted between sepsis and normal mouse models. Differential expressional genes with the closest relationship to disease status and development were identified through module correlation analysis. Then, common biomarkers in proteomics and transcriptomics were extracted as target biomarkers. Through analyzing expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), colocalization analysis on Apoa2 and sepsis phenotype was conducted by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). Then, two-sample and drug-target, syndrome Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were all conducted using the Twosample R package. For protein level, protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) of the target biomarker were also included in MR. Animal experiments helped validate these results. As a result, Apoa2 protein or mRNA was identified as a target biomarker for H-2 with a protective, causal relationship with sepsis. HDL and type 2 diabetes were proven to possess causal relationships with sepsis. The agitation and inhibition of Apoa2 were indicated to influence sepsis and related syndromes. In conclusion, we first proposed Apoa2 as a target for H-2 treatment.

AB  - Purpose Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious complication of hyperglycemia and treatment options to slow its progression are scarce. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are common glucose-lowering drugs in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Among these, linagliptin has been suggested to exert kidney protective effects. It is investigated whether an effect of linagliptin on kidney function could be unmasked by characterizing the urinary proteome profile (UPP) in albuminuric T2D individuals. Experimental design Participants of the MARLINA-T2D trial (NCT01792518) are randomized 1:1 to receive either linagliptin 5 mg or placebo for 24 weeks. A previously developed proteome-based classifier, CKD273, is assessed. Results Results confirm a significant correlation between CKD273 and clinical kidney parameters as well as with eGFR decline. Patient stratification using CKD273 at baseline, show a trend toward attenuation of renal function loss in high CKD-risk patients treated with linagliptin. Moreover, characterized are linagliptin affected peptides of which the majority contained a DPP-4 target sequence. Conclusions and clinical relevance CKD273 is a promising tool for identifying patients at high risk for CKD progression and may unmask a potential of linagliptin to slow progressive kidney function loss in high CKD-risk patients. UPP characterization reveals a significant impact of linagliptin on urinary peptides.

AB  - The human gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a pivotal factor in diabetes management, playing a significant role in the body's response to treatment. However, it is important to understand that long-term usage of medicines like metformin and other diabetic treatments can result in problems, gastrointestinal discomfort, and dysbiosis of the gut flora. Advanced sequencing technologies have improved our understanding of the gut microbiome's role in diabetes, uncovering complex interactions between microbial composition and metabolic health. We explore how the gut microbiota affects glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity by examining a variety of-omics data, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics. Machine learning algorithms and genome-scale modeling are now being applied to find microbiological biomarkers associated with diabetes risk, predicted disease progression, and guide customized therapy. This study holds promise for specialized diabetic therapy. Despite significant advances, some concerns remain unanswered, including understanding the complex relationship between diabetes etiology and gut microbiota, as well as developing user-friendly technological innovations. This mini-review explores the relationship between multiomics, precision medicine, and machine learning to improve our understanding of the gut microbiome's function in diabetes. In the era of precision medicine, the ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through personalized treatments.

AB  - Reliable protein markers for pre-diabetes in humans are not clinically available. In order to identify novel and reliable protein markers for pre-diabetes in humans, healthy volunteers and patients diagnosed with pre-diabetes and stroke were recruited for blood collection. Blood samples were collected from healthy and pre-diabetic subjects 12 h after fasting. BMI was calculated from body weight and height. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (Hb(A1C)), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), insulin and albumin were assayed by automated clinical laboratory methods. We used a quantitative proteomics approach to identify 1074 proteins from the sera of pre-diabetic and healthy subjects. Among them, 500 proteins were then selected using Mascot analysis scores. Further, 70 out of 500 proteins were selected via volcano plot analysis according to their statistical significance and average relative protein ratio. Eventually, 7 serum proteins were singled out as candidate markers for pre-diabetes due to their diabetic relevance and statistical significance. Immunoblotting data demonstrated that laminin subunit alpha 2 (LAMA2), mixed-lineage leukemia 4 (MLL4), and plexin domain containing 2 (PLXDC2) were expressed in pre-diabetic patients but not healthy volunteers. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the combination of the three proteins has greater diagnostic efficacy than any individual protein. Thus, LAMA2, MLL4 and PLXDC2 are novel and reliable serum protein markers for pre-diabetic diagnosis in humans.

AB  - OBJECTIVE- Chronic renal insufficiency and/or proteinuria in type 2 diabetes may stem from chronic renal diseases (CKD) other than classic diabetic nephropathy in more than one-third of patients. We interrogated urine proteomic profiles generated by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry with the aim of isolating a set of biomarkers able to reliably identify biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy and to establish a stringent correlation with the different patterns of renal injury.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS- Ten micrograms of urine proteins from 190 subjects (20 healthy subjects, 20 normoalbuminuric, and 18 microalbuminuric diabetic patients and 132 patients with biopsy-proven nephropathy: 65 diabetic nephropathy, 10 diabetic with nondiabetic CKD [nd-CKD], and 57 nondiabetic with CKD) were run using a CM 10 ProteinChip array and analyzed by supervised learning methods (Classification and Regression Tree analysis).
   RESULTS- The classification model correctly identified 75% of patients with normoalbuminuria, 87.5% of those with microalbuminuria, and 87.5% of those with diabetic nephropathy when applied to a blinded testing set. Most importantly, it was able to reliably differentiate diabetic nephropathy from nd-CKD in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Among the best predictors of the classification model, we identified and validated two proteins, ubiquitin and beta(2-)microglobulin.
   CONCLUSIONS- Our data suggest the presence of a specific urine proteomic signature able to reliably identify type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic glomerulosclerosis.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MTS) is a cluster of concurrent metabolic abnormal conditions. MTS and its component metabolic diseases are heterogeneous and closely related, making their relationships complicated, thus hindering precision treatment.
   Methods: We collected seven groups of samples (group a: healthy individuals; group b: obesity; group c: MTS; group d: hyperglycemia, group e: hypertension, group f: hyperlipidemia; group g: type II diabetes, n=7 for each group). We examined the molecular characteristics of each sample by metabolomic, proteomic and peptidomic profiling analysis. The differential molecules (including metabolites, proteins and peptides) between each disease group and the healthy group were recognized by statistical analyses. Furthermore, a two-step clustering workflow which combines multi-omics and clinical information was used to redefine molecularly and clinically differential groups. Meanwhile, molecular, clinical, network and pathway based analyses were used to identify the group-specific biological features.
   Results: Both shared and disease-specific molecular profiles among the six types of diseases were identified. Meanwhile, the patients were stratified into three distinct groups which were different from original disease definitions but presented significant differences in glucose and lipid metabolism (Group 1: relatively favorable metabolic conditions; Group 2: severe dyslipidemia; Group 3: dysregulated insulin and glucose). Group specific biological signatures were also systematically described. The dyslipidemia group showed higher levels in multiple lipid metabolites like phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine, and showed significant up-regulations in lipid and amino acid metabolism pathways. The glucose dysregulated group showed higher levels in many polypeptides from proteins contributing to immune response. The another group, with better glucose/lipid metabolism ability, showed higher levels in lipid regulating enzymes like the lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase and proteins involved in complement and coagulation cascades.
   Conclusions: This multi-omics based study provides a general view of the complex relationships and an alternative classification for various metabolic diseases where the cross-talk or compensatory mechanism between the immune and metabolism systems plays a critical role.

AB  - In addition to their fundamental role in clearance, the kidneys release select molecules into the circulation, but whether any of these anabolic functions provides insight on kidney health is unknown. Using aptamer-based proteomics, we characterized arterial (A)-to-renal venous (V) gradients for >1,300 proteins in 22 individuals who underwent invasive sampling. Although most of the proteins that changed significantly decreased from A to V, consistent with renal clearance, several were found to increase, the most significant of which was testican-2. To assess the clinical implications of these physiologic findings, we examined proteomic data in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), an African-American cohort (n = 1,928), with replication in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), a White cohort (n = 1,621). In both populations, testican-2 had a strong, positive correlation with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In addition, higher baseline testican-2 levels were associated with a lower rate of eGFR decline in models adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, baseline eGFR, and albuminuria. Glomerular expression of testican-2 in human kidneys was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy, while single-cell RNA sequencing of human kidneys showed expression of the cognate gene, SPOCK2, exclusively in podocytes. In vitro, testican-2 increased glomerular endothelial tube formation and motility, raising the possibility that its secretion has a functional role within the glomerulus. Taken together, our findings identify testican-2 as a podocyte-derived biomarker of kidney health and prognosis.

AB  - The low-calorie sweetener erythritol is endogenously produced from glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway in humans. Erythritol is of medical interest because elevated plasma levels of this polyol are predictive for visceral adiposity gain and development of type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms behind these associations remain unknown because the erythritol biosynthesis pathway, particularly the enzyme catalyzing the final step of erythritol synthesis (reduction of erythrose to erythritol), is not characterized. In this study, we purified two enzymes from rabbit liver capable of catalyzing the conversion of erythrose to erythritol: alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD). Both recombinant human ADH1 and SORD reduce erythrose to erythritol, using NADPH as a co-factor, and cell culture studies indicate that this activity is primarily NADPH-dependent. We found that ADH1 variants vary markedly in both their affinity for erythrose and their catalytic capacity (turnover number). Interestingly, the recombinant protein produced from the ADH1B2 variant, common in Asian populations, is not active when NADPH is used as a co-factor in vitro. We also confirmed SORD contributes to intracellular erythritol production in human A549 lung cancer cells, where ADH1 is minimally expressed. In summary, human ADH1 and SORD catalyze the conversion of erythrose to erythritol, pointing to novel roles for two dehydrogenase proteins in human glucose metabolism that may contribute to individual responses to diet. Proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD015178.

AB  - Background
   Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication associated with adverse outcomes including preeclampsia, caesarean section, macrosomia, neonatal morbidity and future development of type 2 diabetes in both mother and child. Current selective screening strategies rely on clinical risk factors such as age, family history of diabetes, macrosomia or GDM in a previous pregnancy, and they possess a relatively low specificity. Here we hypothesize that novel first trimester protein predictors of GDM can contribute to the current selective screening strategies for early and accurate prediction of GDM, thus allowing for timely interventions.
   Methods
   A proteomics discovery approach was applied to first trimester sera from obese (BMI >= 27 kg/m(2)) women (n = 60) in a nested case-control study design, utilizing tandem mass tag labelling and tandem mass spectrometry. A subset of the identified protein markers was further validated in a second set of serum samples (n = 210) and evaluated for their contribution as predictors of GDM in relation to the maternal risk factors, by use of logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis.
   Results
   Serum proteomic profiling identified 25 proteins with significantly different levels between cases and controls. Three proteins; afamin, serum amyloid P-component and vitronectin could be further confirmed as predictors of GDM in a validation set. Vitronectin was shown to contribute significantly to the predictive power of the maternal risk factors, indicating it as a novel independent predictor of GDM.
   Conclusions
   Current selective screening strategies can potentially be improved by addition of protein predictors.

AB  - Obesity leads to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and associated alterations to the plasma proteome. To elucidate the underlying changes associated with obesity, we performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in the liver and plasma of obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and integrated these data with publicly available transcriptomic and proteomic datasets of obesity and metabolic diseases in preclinical and clinical cohorts. We quantified 7173 and 555 proteins in the liver and plasma proteomes, respectively. The abundance of proteins related to fatty acid metabolism were increased, alongside peroxisomal proliferation in ob/ob liver. Putatively secreted proteins and the secretory machinery were also dysregulated in the liver, which was mirrored by a substantial alteration of the plasma proteome. Greater than 50% of the plasma proteins were differentially regulated, including NAFLD biomarkers, lipoproteins, the 20S proteasome, and the complement and coagulation cascades of the immune system. Integration of the liver and plasma proteomes identified proteins that were concomitantly regulated in the liver and plasma in obesity, suggesting that the systemic abundance of these plasma proteins is regulated by secretion from the liver. Many of these proteins are systemically regulated during type 2 diabetes and/or NAFLD in humans, indicating the clinical importance of liver- plasma cross talk and the relevance of our investigations in ob/ob mice. Together, these analyses yield a comprehensive insight into obesity and provide an extensive resource for obesity research in a prevailing model organism.

AB  - Diabetes has become a major public health concern worldwide, most of which are type 2 diabetes (T2D). The diagnosis of T2D is commonly based on plasma glucose levels, and there are no reliable clinical biomarkers available for early detection. Recent advances in proteome technologies offer new opportunity for the understanding of T2D; however, the underlying proteomic characteristics of T2D have not been thoroughly investigated yet. Here, using proteomic and glycoproteomic profiling, we provided a comprehensive landscape of molecular alterations in the fasting plasma of the 24 Chinese participants, including eight T2D patients, eight prediabetic (PDB) subjects, and eight healthy control (HC) individuals. Our analyses identified a diverse set of potential biomarkers that might enhance the efficiency and accuracy based on current existing biological indicators of (pre)diabetes. Through integrative omics analysis, we showed the capability of glycoproteomics as a complement to proteomics or metabolomics, to provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of (pre)diabetes. We have newly identified systemic site-specific N-glycosylation alterations underlying T2D patients in the complement activation pathways, including decreased levels of N-glycopeptides from C1s, MASP1, and CFP proteins, and increased levels of N-glycopeptides from C2, C4, C4BPA, C4BPB, and CFH. These alterations were not observed at proteomic levels, suggesting new opportunities for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Our results demonstrate a great potential role of glycoproteomics in understanding (pre)diabetes and present a new direction for diabetes research which deserves more attention.

AB  - Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) are a heterogeneous group of membrane-bound vesicles that originate from the urinary system. They are considered to be an informative resource for the non-invasive study of molecular events in health and disease as they carry a variety of molecular constituents from their cells of origin, such as lipids, proteins and RNAs. For early stages of biomarker discovery schemes, untargeted omics-based approaches, which preferably employs uEVs isolated from pooled urine samples, may suit better. However, targeted approaches that preferably uses uEV isolated from individual urine samples are preferred for validation and clinical translation. The volume of urine needed for downstream analytical purposes and the sampling method (i.e. pooled vs. individual samples) are important practical aspects which need to be taken into consideration along with the challenges associated with the different methods of uEVs isolation. Here we provide an overview of the various isolation methods with special focus on the initial sample volumes as well as the sampling method applied. Our original data on the isolation of uEVs by employing salt precipitation and the sucrose/D2O double cushion ultracentrifugation method is also presented along with the latest trends over the last three years on their clinical applications. In this work, we demonstrate the performance and the reproducibility of the method using small volumes of individual and pooled samples as well as samples of a small group of patients with type 2 diabetes. Our data shows that the isolation method is compatible with both individual and pooled samples-based quantitative proteomics strategies.

AB  - BackgroundChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common hematologic malignancy. Although previous research has explored associations between plasma proteins and CLL, the causal relationships remain unclear. This study used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationship between 7156 plasma proteins and CLL risk.MethodsA two-sample MR analysis assessed the impact of specific plasma proteins on CLL risk, using data from the Finngen Proteomics project (analyzing 828 participants) and the UK Biobank. Additional analyses included colocalization, phenomenon-wide MR, and protein-protein interaction networks.ResultsThe study identified nine plasma proteins significantly associated with CLL risk. Increased levels of Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase E (PPIE) (OR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.22-2.27, P = 0.001) were associated with an increased risk of developing CLL, whereas Protein O-Mannosyltransferase 2 (POMGNT2) (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.91, P = 0.017) and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 14(CCL14) (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.67-0.94, P = 0.010) were associated with a reduced risk of CLL. Colocalization analysis suggested that PPIE may share pathogenic variants with CLL (PP.H4 = 0.758). Phenomenon-wide MR analysis of PPIE also indicated associations with other clinical features, including rheumatic diseases and type 2 diabetes. Protein-protein interaction and drug-gene interaction analyses highlighted CDC5L and SNW1 as potential therapeutic targets.ConclusionThis study identifies nine plasma proteins linked to CLL risk, with PPIE offering new insights into the disease's pathogenesis. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore their potential as therapeutic targets.

AB  - Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and its major clinical manifestation, progressive renal decline that leads to endstage renal disease (ESRD), are a major health burden for individuals with diabetes. The disease process that underlies progressive renal decline comprises factors that increase risk as well as factors that protect against this outcome. Using untargeted proteomic profiling of circulating proteins from individuals in two independent cohorts with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and varying stages of DKD followed for 7 to 15 years, we identified three elevated plasma proteins-fibroblast growth factor 20 (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88), angiopoietin-1 (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.91), and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 12 (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.95)that were associated with protection against progressive renal decline and progression to ESRD. The combined effect of these three protective proteins was demonstrated by very low cumulative risk of ESRD in those who had baseline concentrations above median for all three proteins, whereas the cumulative risk of ESRD was high in those with concentrations below median for these proteins at the beginning of follow- up. This protective effect was shown to be independent from circulating inflammatory proteins and clinical covariates and was confirmed in a third cohort of diabetic individuals with normal renal function. These three protective proteins may serve as biomarkers to stratify diabetic individuals according to risk of progression to ESRD and might also be investigated as potential therapeutics to delay or prevent the onset of ESRD.

AB  - It was unknown whether plasma protein levels can be estimated based on DNA methylation (DNAm) levels, and if so, how the resulting surrogates can be consolidated into a powerful predictor of lifespan. We present here, seven DNAm-based estimators of plasma proteins including those of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and growth differentiation factor 15. The resulting predictor of lifespan, DNAm GrimAge (in units of years), is a composite biomarker based on the seven DNAm surrogates and a DNAm-based estimator of smoking pack-years. Adjusting DNAm GrimAge for chronological age generated novel measure of epigenetic age acceleration, AgeAccelGrim.
   Using large scale validation data from thousands of individuals, we demonstrate that DNAm GrimAge stands out among existing epigenetic clocks in terms of its predictive ability for time-to-death (Cox regression P= 2.0E-75), time-to-coronary heart disease (P= 6.2E-24), time-to-cancer (P= 1.3E-12), its strong relationship with computed tomography data for fatty liver/excess visceral fat, and age-at-menopause (P= 1.6E-12). AgeAccelGrim is strongly associated with a host of age-related conditions including comorbidity count (P= 3.45E-17). Similarly, age-adjusted DNAm PAI-1 levels are associated with lifespan (P= 5.4E-28), comorbidity count (P= 7.3E-56) and type 2 diabetes (P= 2.0E-26). These DNAm-based biomarkers show the expected relationship with lifestyle factors including healthy diet and educational attainment.
   Overall, these epigenetic biomarkers are expected to find many applications including human anti-aging studies.

AB  - Approximately 2% of the human genome encodes for proteases. Unfortunately, however, the biological roles of most of these enzymes remain poorly defined, since the physiological substrates are typically unknown and are difficult to identify using traditional methods. We have developed a proteomics experiment based on FTMS profiling and differential mass spectrometry (dMS) to identify candidate endogenous substrates of proteases using fractionated human plasma as the candidate substrate pool. Here we report proof-of-concept experiments for identifying in vitro substrates of antinopeptidase P2, (APP2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), a peptidase of therapeutic interest for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. For both proteases, previously validated peptide substrates spiked into the human plasma pool were identified. Of note, the differential mass spectrometry experiments also identified novel substrates for each peptidase in the subfraction of human plasma. Targeted MS/MS analysis of these peptides in the complex human plasma pool and manual confirmation of the amino acid sequences led to the identification of these substrates. The novel DPP-4 substrate EPLGRQLTSGP was chemically synthesized and cleavage kinetics were determined in an in vitro DPP-4 enzyme assay. The apparent second order rate constant (k(cat)/K-M) for DPP-4-mediated cleavage was determined to be 2.3 x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) confirming that this peptide is efficiently processed by the peptidase in vitro. Collectively, these results demonstrate that differential mass spectrometry has the potential to identify candidate endogenous substrates of target proteases from a human plasma pool. Importantly, knowledge of the endogenous substrates can provide useful insight into the biology of these enzymes and provides useful biomarkers for monitoring their activity in vivo.

AB  - Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) identify genes that are dysregulated by the studied clinical endpoints, thereby indicating potential new diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets and therapy options. Combining EWAS with deep molecular phenotyping, such as approaches enabled by metabolomics and proteomics, allows further probing of the underlying disease-associated pathways. For instance, methylation of the TXNIP gene is associated robustly with prevalent type 2 diabetes and further with metabolites that are short-term markers of glycaemic control. These associations reflect TXNIP's function as a glucose uptake regulator by interaction with the major glucose transporter GLUT1 and suggest that TXNIP methylation can be used as a read-out for the organism's exposure to glucose stress. Another case is the association between DNA methylation of the AHRR and F2RL3 genes with smoking and a protein that is involved in the reprogramming of the bronchial epithelium. These examples show that associations between DNA methylation and intermediate molecular traits can open new windows into how the body copes with physiological challenges. This knowledge, if carefully interpreted, may indicate novel therapy options and, together with monitoring of the methylation state of specific methylation sites, may in the future allow the early diagnosis of impending disease. It is essential for medical practitioners to recognize the potential that this field holds in translating basic research findings to clinical practice. In this review, we present recent advances in the field of EWAS with metabolomics and proteomics and discuss both the potential and the challenges of translating epigenetic associations, with deep molecular phenotypes, to biomedical applications.

AB  - It has been proposed that mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). To dissect the underlying mechanisms, we performed a multiplexed proteomics study on liver mitochondria isolated from a spontaneous diabetic rat model before/after they were rendered diabetic. Altogether, we identified 1091 mitochondrial proteins, 228 phosphoproteins, and 355 hydroxyproteins. Mitochondrial proteins were found to undergo expression changes in a highly correlated fashion during T2D development. For example, proteins involved in beta-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and other bioenergetic processes were coordinately up-regulated, indicating that liver cells confronted T2D by increasing energy expenditure and activating pathways that rid themselves of the constitutively increased flux of glucose and lipid. Notably, activation of oxidative phosphorylation was immediately related to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which caused oxidative stress within the cells. Increased oxidative stress was also evidenced by our post-translational modification profiles such that mitochondrial proteins were more heavily hydroxylated during T2D development. Moreover, we observed a distinct depression of antiapoptosis and antioxidative stress proteins that might reflect a higher apoptotic index under the diabetic stage. We suggest that such changes in systematic metabolism were causally linked to the development of T2D. Comparing proteomics data against microarray data, we demonstrated that many T2D-related alterations were unidentifiable by either proteomics or genomics approaches alone, underscoring the importance of integrating different approaches. Our compendium could help to unveil pathogenic events in mitochondria leading to T2D and be useful for the discovery of diagnosis biomarker and therapeutic targets of T2D.

TI  - Associations between circulating proteins and cardiometabolic diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational and Mendelian randomisation studies
T2  - HEART
KW  - TRIAL
AB  - Background Integration of large proteomics and genetic data in population-based studies can provide insights into discovery of novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). We aimed to synthesise existing evidence on the observational and genetic associations between circulating proteins and CMD.
   Methods PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched until July 2023 for potentially relevant prospective observational and Mendelian randomisation (MR) studies investigating associations between circulating proteins and CMD, including coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and atherosclerosis. Two investigators independently extracted study characteristics using a standard form and pooled data using random effects models.
   Results 50 observational, 25 MR and 10 studies performing both analyses were included, involving 26414160 non-overlapping participants. Meta-analysis of observational studies revealed 560 proteins associated with CMD, of which 133 proteins were associated with >= 2 CMDs (ie, pleiotropic). There were 245 potentially causal protein biomarkers identified in MR pooled results, involving 23 pleiotropic proteins. IL6RA and MMP12 were each causally associated with seven diseases. 22 protein-disease pairs showed directionally concordant associations in observational and MR pooled estimates. Addition of protein biomarkers to traditional clinical models modestly improved the accuracy of predicting incident CMD, with the highest improvement for heart failure (Delta C-index 0.2). Of the 245 potentially causal proteins (291 protein-disease pairs), 3 pairs were validated by evidence of drug development from existing drug databases, 288 pairs lacked evidence of drug development and 66 proteins were drug targets approved for other indications.
   Conclusions Combined analyses of observational and genetic studies revealed the potential causal role of several proteins in the aetiology of CMD. Novel protein biomarkers are promising targets for drug development and risk stratification.

AB  - It is crucial to understand the glucose control within our bodies. Bariatric/metabolic surgeries, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), provide an avenue for exploring the potential key factors involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis since these surgeries have shown promising results in improving glycemic control among patients with severe type 2 diabetes (T2D). For the first time, a markedly altered population of serum proteins in patients after LSG was discovered and analyzed through proteomics. Apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) was revealed to be increased dramatically in diabetic obese patients following LSG, and a similar effect was observed in patients after RYGB surgery. Moreover, recombinant apoA-IV protein treatment was proven to enhance insulin secretion in isolated human islets. These results showed that apoA-IV may play a crucial role in glycemic control in humans, potentially through enhancing insulin secretion in human islets. ApoA-IV was further shown to enhance energy expenditure and improve glucose tolerance in diabetic rodents, through stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells, partially via G alpha s-coupled GPCR/cAMP (G protein-coupled receptor/cyclic adenosine monophosphate) signaling. Furthermore, T55-121, truncated peptide 55-121 of apoA-IV, was discovered to mediate the function of apoA-IV. These collective findings contribute to our understanding of the relationship between apoA-IV and glycemic control, highlighting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target in managing and improving glucose regulation.

AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the major late complications of diabetes. Treatment aimed at slowing down the progression of DN is available but methods for early and definitive detection of DN progression are currently lacking. The 'Proteomic prediction and Renin angiotensin aldosterone system Inhibition prevention Of early diabetic nephRopathy In TYpe 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria trial' (PRIORITY) aims to evaluate the early detection of DN in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using a urinary proteome-based classifier (CKD273).
   In this ancillary study of the recently initiated PRIORITY trial we aimed to validate for the first time the CKD273 classifier in a multicentre (9 different institutions providing samples from 165 T2D patients) prospective setting. In addition we also investigated the influence of sample containers, age and gender on the CKD273 classifier.
   We observed a high consistency of the CKD273 classification scores across the different centres with areas under the curves ranging from 0.95 to 1.00. The classifier was independent of age (range tested 16-89 years) and gender. Furthermore, the use of different urine storage containers did not affect the classification scores. Analysis of the distribution of the individual peptides of the classifier over the nine different centres showed that fragments of blood-derived and extracellular matrix proteins were the most consistently found.
   We provide for the first time validation of this urinary proteome-based classifier in a multicentre prospective setting and show the suitability of the CKD273 classifier to be used in the PRIORITY trial.

AB  - One of the major difficulties in mining low abundance biomarkers from serum or plasma is due to the fact that a small number of proteins such as albumin, alpha2-macroglobulin, transferrin, and immunoglobulins, may represent as much as 80% of the total serum protein. The large quantity of these proteins makes it difficult to identify low abundance proteins in serum using traditional 2-dimensional electrophoresis. We recently used a combination of multidimensional liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-quadrupole-time of flight and Ion Trap liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify protein markers in sera of Alzheimer's disease (AD), insulin resistance/type-2 diabetes (IR/D2), and congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. We identified 8 proteins that exhibit higher levels in control sera and 36 proteins that exhibit higher levels in disease sera. For example, haptoglobin and hemoglobin are elevated in sera of AD, IR/D2, and CHF patients. The levels of several other proteins including fibrinogen and its fragments, alpha 2-macroglobulin, transthyretin, pro-platelet basic protein, protease inhibitors clade A and C, as well as proteins involved in the classical complement pathway such as complement C3, C4,and C1 inhibitor, were found to differ between IR/D2 and control sera. The sera levels of proteins, such as the 10 kDa subunit of vitronectin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, apolipoprotein B100, fragment of factor H, and histidine-rich glycoprotein were observed to be different between AD and controls. The differences observed in these biomarker candidates were confirmed by Western blot and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The biological meaning of the proteomic changes in the disease states and the potential use of these changes as diagnostic tools or for therapeutic intervention will be discussed.

AB  - Kidney fibrosis is considered the final convergent pathway for progressive chronic kidney diseases, but there is still a paucity of success in clinical application for effective therapy. We recently demonstrated that the expression of secreted leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein-1 (LRG1) is associated with worsened kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and that LRG1 enhances endothelial transforming growth factor-beta signaling to promote diabetic kidney disease progression. While the increased expression of LRG1 was most prominent in the glomerular endothelial cells in diabetic kidneys, its increase was also observed in the tubulointerstitial compartment. Here, we explored the potential role of LRG1 in kidney epithelial cells and TGF-beta- mediated tubulointerstitial fibrosis independent of diabetes. LRG1 expression was induced by tumor necrosis factor-a in cultured kidney epithelial cells and potentiated TGF-beta/Smad3 signal transduction. Global Lrg1 loss in mice led to marked attenuation of tubulointerstitial fibrosis in models of unilateral ureteral obstruction and aristolochic acid fibrosis associated with concomitant decreases in Smad3 phosphorylation in tubule epithelial cells. In mice with kidney epithelial cell-specific LRG1 overexpression, while no significant phenotypes were observed at baseline, marked exacerbation of tubulointerstitial fibrosis was observed in the obstructed kidneys. This was associated with enhanced Smad3 phosphorylation in both kidney epithelial cells and asmooth muscle actin-positive interstitial cells. Co-culture of kidney epithelial cells with primary kidney fibroblasts confirmed the potentiation of TGF-beta-mediated Smad3 activation in kidney fibroblasts through epithelial-derived LRG1. Thus, our results indicate that enhanced LRG1 expression-induced epithelial injury is an amplifier of TGF-beta signaling in autocrine and paracrine manners promoting tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Hence, therapeutic targeting of LRG1 may be an effective means to curtail kidney fibrosis progression in chronic kidney disease.

AB  - This study applies a large proteomics panel to search for new circulating biomarkers associated with progression to kidney failure in individuals with diabetic kidney disease. Four independent cohorts encompassing 754 individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and early and late diabetic kidney disease were followed to ascertain progression to kidney failure. During ten years of follow-up, 227 of 754 individuals progressed to kidney failure. Using the SOMAscan proteomics platform, we measured baseline concentration of 1129 circulating proteins. In our previous publications, we analyzed 334 of these proteins that were members of specific candidate pathways involved in diabetic kidney disease and found 35 proteins strongly associated with risk of progression to kidney failure. Here, we examined the remaining 795 proteins using an untargeted approach. Of these remaining proteins, 11 were significantly associated with progression to kidney failure. Biological processes previously reported for these proteins were related to neuron development (DLL1, MATN2, NRX1B, KLK8, RTN4R and ROR1) and were implicated in the development of kidney fibrosis (LAYN, DLL1, MAPK11, MATN2, endostatin, and ROR1) in cellular and animal studies. Specific mechanisms that underlie involvement of these proteins in progression of diabetic kidney disease must be further investigated to assess their value as targets for kidney-protective therapies. Using multivariable LASSO regression analysis, five proteins (LAYN, ESAM, DLL1, MAPK11 and endostatin) were found independently associated with risk of progression to kidney failure. Thus, our study identified proteins that may be considered as new candidate prognostic biomarkers to predict risk of progression to kidney failure in diabetic kidney disease. Furthermore, three of these proteins (DLL1, ESAM, and MAPK11) were selected as candidate biomarkers when all SOMAscan results were evaluated.

AB  - Objective: This study assessed the proteomic profiles of cytokines and chemokines in individuals with moderate to severe depression, with or without comorbid medical disorders, compared to healthy controls. Two proteomic multiplex platforms were employed for this purpose. Metods: An immunofluorescent multiplex platform and an aptamer-based method were used to evaluate 32 protein analytes from 153 individuals with moderate to severe major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HCs). The study focused on determining the level of agreement between the two platforms and evaluating the ability of individual analytes and principal components (PCs) to differentiate between the MDD and HC groups. Additionally, the study investigated the relationship between PCs consisting of chemokines and cytokines and comorbid inflammatory and cardiometabolic diseases. Findings: Analysis revealed a small or moderate correlation between 47% of the analytes measured by the two platforms. Two proteomic profiles were identified that differentiated individuals with moderate to severe MDD from HCs. High eotaxin, age, BMI, IP-10, or IL -10 characterized profile 1. This profile was associated with several cardiometabolic risk factors, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Profile 2 is characterized by higher age, BMI, interleukins, and a strong negative loading for eotaxin. This profile was associated with inflammation but not cardiometabolic risk factors. Conclusion: This study provides further evidence that proteomic profiles can be used to identify potential biomarkers and pathways associated with MDD and comorbidities. Our findings suggest that MDD is associated with distinct profiles of proteins that are also associated with cardiometabolic risk factors, inflammation, and obesity. In particular, the chemokines eotaxin and IP-10 appear to play a role in the relationship between MDD and cardiometabolic risk factors. These findings suggest that a focus on the interplay between MDD and comorbidities may be useful in identifying potential targets for intervention and improving overall health outcomes.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine and metabolic disorder affecting up to 15% of women at reproductive age. The main features of PCOS are hyperandrogenism and irregular menstrual cycles together with metabolic dysfunctions including hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance and a 4-fold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Despite the high prevalence the pathophysiology of the syndrome is unclear. Insulin resistance in women with PCOS likely affect the skeletal muscle and recently it was demonstrated that changes in DNA methylation affects the gene expression in skeletal muscle that in part can explain their metabolic abnormalities. The objective of this work was to combine gene expression array data from different datasets to improve statistical power and thereby identify novel biomarkers that can be further explored. In this narrative review, we performed a meta-analysis of skeletal muscle arrays available from Gene Expression Omnibus and from publications. The eligibility criteria were published articles in English, and baseline (no treatment) skeletal muscle samples from women with PCOS and controls. The R package Metafor was used for integration of the datasets. One hundred and fourteen unique transcripts were differentially expressed in skeletal muscle from women with PCOS vs. controls (q < 0.05), 87% of these transcripts have not been previously identified as altered in PCOS muscle. ING2, CDKAL1, and AKTIP had the largest differential increase in expression, and TSHZ2, FKBP2, and OCEL1 had the largest decrease in expression. Two genes, IRX3 and CDKAL1 were consistently upregulated (q < 0.05) in the individual analyses and meta-analysis. Based on the meta-analysis, we identified several dysregulated immunometabolic pathways as a part of the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle of women with PCOS. The transcriptomic data need to be verified by functional analyses as well as proteomics to advance our understanding of PCOS specific insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.

AB  - Aims Recent evidence points towards a distinct obese phenotype among patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We aimed to identify differentially expressed circulating biomarkers in obese HFpEF patients and link them to disease severity and outcomes.
   Methods and results From the LIFE-Heart study, 999 patients with HFpEF and 999 patients without heart failure (no-HF) were selected and 92 circulating serum biomarkers were measured using a proximity extension assay. Elevation of identified biomarkers was validated in 220 patients from the Aldo-DHF trial with diagnosed HFpEF. HFpEF patients were older and had more comorbidities including coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes as compared to no-HF patients (P < 0.05 for all). After adjusting for covariates, adrenomedullin (ADM), galectin-9 (Gal-9), thrombospondin-2 (THBS-2), CD4, and tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) were significantly higher in obese HFpEF patients [body mass index (BMI) >= 30 kg/m(2), n = 464] as compared to lean HFpEF (BMI <30 kg/m(2), n = 535) and obese no-HF patients (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2), n = 387) (P < 0.001 for both); these findings were verified in the Aldo-DHF validation cohort (P < 0.001). Except for CD4 these proteins were associated with increased estimates of left atrial pressure in a linear fashion. Importantly, ADM and CD4 were associated with increased mortality in obese HFpEF patients after adjusting for covariates.
   Conclusion Obese HFpEF patients exhibit higher circulating biomarkers of volume expansion (ADM), myocardial fibrosis (THBS-2) and systemic inflammation (Gal-9, CD4) compared to obese non-HFpEF or lean HFpEF patients. These findings support the clinical definition of a distinct obese HFpEF phenotype and might merit further investigation.

AB  - Introduction: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have emerged as novel therapeutics to treat diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Although the beneficial effects of SGLT2i have been demonstrated, their target mechanisms on kidney function are unknown. The current study aimed to elucidate these mechanisms by studying SGLT2i-induced changes in the urinary proteome of persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and DKD. Methods: A total of 40 participants with T2D were enrolled in a double -blinded randomized cross -over trial at the Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Denmark. They were treated with 10 mg of dapagliflozin for 12 weeks. Thirty-two participants with complete urinary proteomics measures before and after the trial were included. All participants received renin-angiotensin system blockade and had albuminuria, (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] >= 30 mg/g). A type 1 diabetes (T1D) cohort consisting of healthy controls and persons with DKD was included for validation. Urinary proteome changes were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted to discover affected biological processes. Results: Dapagliflozin treatment significantly (P-adjusted < 0.05) affected 36 urinary peptide fragments derived from 19 proteins. Eighteen proteins were correspondingly reflected in the validation cohort. A multifold change in peptide abundance was observed in many proteins (A1BG, urinary albumin [ALB], Caldesmon 1, COLCRNN, heat shock protein 90-beta [HSP90AB1], IGLL5, peptidase inhibitor 16 [PI16], prostaglandin-H2-D-isomerase [PTGDS], SERPINA1). These also included urinary biomarkers of kidney fibrosis and function (type I and III collagens and albumin). Biological processes relating to inflammation, wound healing, and kidney fibrosis were enriched. Conclusion: The current study discovers the urinary proteome impacted by the SGLT2i, thereby providing new potential target sites and pathways, especially relating to wound healing and inflammation.

AB  - Background: The pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus (DM) is variable, comprising different inflammatory and immune responses. Proteome analysis holds the promise of delivering insight into the pathophysiological changes associated with diabetes. Recently, we identified and validated urinary proteomics biomarkers for diabetes. Based on these initial findings, we aimed to further validate urinary proteomics biomarkers specific for diabetes in general, and particularity associated with either type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Therefore, the low-molecular-weight urinary proteome of 902 subjects from 10 different centers, 315 controls and 587 patients with T1D (n = 299) or T2D (n = 288), was analyzed using capillary-electrophoresis mass-spectrometry. The 261 urinary biomarkers (100 were sequenced) previously discovered in 205 subjects were validated in an additional 697 subjects to distinguish DM subjects (n = 382) from control subjects (n = 315) with 94% (95% CI: 92-95) accuracy in this study. To identify biomarkers that differentiate T1D from T2D, a subset of normoalbuminuric patients with T1D (n = 68) and T2D (n = 42) was employed, enabling identification of 131 biomarker candidates (40 were sequenced) differentially regulated between T1D and T2D. These biomarkers distinguished T1D from T2D in an independent validation set of normoalbuminuric patients (n = 108) with 88% (95% CI: 81-94%) accuracy, and in patients with impaired renal function (n = 369) with 85% (95% CI: 81-88%) accuracy. Specific collagen fragments were associated with diabetes and type of diabetes indicating changes in collagen turnover and extracellular matrix as one hallmark of the molecular pathophysiology of diabetes. Additional biomarkers including inflammatory processes and pro-thrombotic alterations were observed.
   Conclusions/Significance: These findings, based on the largest proteomic study performed to date on subjects with DM, validate the previously described biomarkers for DM, and pinpoint differences in the urinary proteome of T1D and T2D, indicating significant differences in extracellular matrix remodeling.

AB  - Context: Islet autoantibodies (IAbs) are currently the most reliable indicators of islet autoimmunity. However, IAbs do not fully meet the need for the prediction and intervention of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Serological proteins should be great sources for biomarkers.
   Objective: This work aimed to identify new proteomic biomarkers with the technology of an expression-based genome-wide association study (eGWAS) in children newly diagnosed with T1D.
   Methods: In an attempt to identify additional biomarkers, we performed an eGWAS using microarray data from 169 arrays of the pancreatic islets of T1D rodents (78 T1D cases and 91 controls). We ranked all 16 099 protein-coding genes by the likelihood of differential expression in the pancreatic islets. Our top 20 secreted proteins were screened in 170 children including 100 newly diagnosed T1D, and 50 type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 20 age-matched healthy children. With 6 proteins showing significance, we further conducted a validation study using the second independent set of 400 samples from children including 200 newly diagnosed with T1D, 100T2D, and 100 age-matched controls.
   Results: We identified 2 serum proteins that were significantly changed in T1 D vs both control and T2D, and 5 serum proteins were significantly changed both in T1D and T2D vs control. Serum osteopontin (OPN) levels were uniquely higher in T1D (T1 D vs controls, P = 1.29E-13 similar to 9.38E-7 T1D vs T2D, P = 2.65E-8 similar to 1.58E-7) with no difference between T2D and healthy control individuals. Serum interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (MA RA) levels were lower in T1D compared both with T2D (P= 3.36E-9 similar to 0.0236) and healthy participants (P= 1.09E-79 similar to 2.00E-12).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that OPN and IL1-RA could be candidates for useful biomarkers for T1D in children.

AB  - Background The risk of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression is significant despite treatment with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocking agents. Current clinical tools cannot predict whether or not patients will respond to treatment with RAS inhibitors (RASi). We aimed to investigate whether proteome analysis could identify urinary peptides as biomarkers that could predict the response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin-receptor blockers treatment to avoid DKD progression. Furthermore, we investigated the comparability of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated using four different GFR equations, for DKD progression.Methods We evaluated urine samples from a discovery cohort of 199 diabetic patients treated with RASi. DKD progression was defined based on eGFR percentage slope results between visits (similar to 1 year) and for the entire period (similar to 3 years) based on the eGFR values of each GFR equation. Urine samples were analysed using capillary electrophoresis-coupled mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was performed between the uncontrolled (patients who did not respond to RASi treatment) and controlled kidney function groups (patients who responded to the RASi treatment). Peptides were combined in a support vector machine-based model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the risk prediction models in two independent validation cohorts treated with RASi.Results The classification of patients into uncontrolled and controlled kidney function varies depending on the GFR equation used, despite the same sample set. We identified 227 peptides showing nominal significant difference and consistent fold changes between uncontrolled and controlled patients in at least three methods of eGFR calculation. These included fragments of collagens, alpha-1-antitrypsin, antithrombin-III, CD99 antigen and uromodulin. A model based on 189 of 227 peptides (DKDp189) showed a significant prediction of non-response to the treatment/DKD progression in two independent cohorts.Conclusions The DKDp189 model demonstrates potential as a predictive tool for guiding treatment with RASi in diabetic patients.

AB  - Food intake and nutrient exposure are key environmental factors involved in the pathogenesis and progression of the common polygenic, diet-related diseases. An individual's phenotype represents a complex interaction between the human genome and environmental factors during an individual's lifetime. This review explores the concept that there is a dynamic, two-way interaction between nutrition and the human genome which determines gene expression, the metabolic response and an individual's health status. It addresses the relevance of new high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic technologies within human nutrition research. Common, polygenic, diet-related diseases (CVD, obesity, T2DM, etc.) reflect multiple genetic variants interacting with numerous environmental factors, each combination making a relatively small contribution to overall cellular homeostasis, whole body metabolism and health. This review highlights the value of a nutrigenomics-based systems biology approach to understanding human nutrition and identifying new biomarkers of nutrition and health. The challenge will be to develop and apply robust nutritional genomics research initiatives that are sensitive enough to take account of both human genetic heterogeneity and diverse nutrient exposure. If nutrigenomic approaches enhance our understanding of human nutrition at the molecular level, then it may be possible to apply a more targeted and effective personalized nutrition approach to attenuate the effect of risk factors associated with diet-related diseases. Indeed it could be proposed that a personalized nutrition approach may assist in improving the effectiveness of dietary guidelines/recommendations in general. (c) 2006 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Background: Quantitative proteomics holds great promise for identifying proteins that are differentially abundant between populations representing different physiological or disease states. A range of computational tools is now available for both isotopically labeled and label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based quantitative proteomics. However, they are generally not comparable to each other in terms of functionality, user interfaces, information input/output, and do not readily facilitate appropriate statistical data analysis. These limitations, along with the array of choices, present a daunting prospect for biologists, and other researchers not trained in bioinformatics, who wish to use LC-MS-based quantitative proteomics.
   Results: We have developed Corra, a computational framework and tools for discovery-based LC-MS proteomics. Corra extends and adapts existing algorithms used for LC-MS-based proteomics, and statistical algorithms, originally developed for microarray data analyses, appropriate for LC-MS data analysis. Corra also adapts software engineering technologies (e. g. Google Web Toolkit, distributed processing) so that computationally intense data processing and statistical analyses can run on a remote server, while the user controls and manages the process from their own computer via a simple web interface. Corra also allows the user to output significantly differentially abundant LC-MS-detected peptide features in a form compatible with subsequent sequence identification via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). We present two case studies to illustrate the application of Corra to commonly performed LC-MS-based biological workflows: a pilot biomarker discovery study of glycoproteins isolated from human plasma samples relevant to type 2 diabetes, and a study in yeast to identify in vivo targets of the protein kinase Ark1 via phosphopeptide profiling.
   Conclusion: The Corra computational framework leverages computational innovation to enable biologists or other researchers to process, analyze and visualize LC-MS data with what would otherwise be a complex and not user-friendly suite of tools. Corra enables appropriate statistical analyses, with controlled false-discovery rates, ultimately to inform subsequent targeted identification of differentially abundant peptides by MS/MS. For the user not trained in bioinformatics, Corra represents a complete, customizable, free and open source computational platform enabling LC-MS-based proteomic workflows, and as such, addresses an unmet need in the LC-MS proteomics field.

AB  - Key PointsShort-term changes (deltas) in concentrations of 40 circulating proteins were good predictors of fast development of ESKD in diabetes.Comparing deltas and baseline concentrations of circulating proteins predicting ESKD, we distinguished biomarkers of initiation, progression, or both.Biomarkers of initiation and progression predominantly included proteins flagging apoptosis processes and TNF receptor signaling pathways.
   BackgroundLimited knowledge exists regarding short-term changes/increases in concentrations of circulating proteins (referred here as deltas) and rapid development of kidney failure (rapid KF) in diabetes mellitus.MethodsConcentrations of 452 circulating proteins were measured using the OLINK proteomics platform at baseline and after a median interval of 3-4 years in 106 individuals with type 1 and 77 with type 2 diabetes in two case-control studies. During 10-year follow-up, 31 and 26 individuals, respectively, developed rapid KF.ResultsDeltas for 40 proteins predicted rapid KF in both studies. All were better predictors than delta urine albumin-creatinine ratio, and half were better than delta glomerular filtration rate. Comparing the delta proteins with 46 circulating proteins of which elevated baseline concentrations were predictors of rapid KF risk in our previous study, 61 unique proteins were identified. Among these proteins, 21 were good predictors of rapid KF only when measured at baseline (predictors of initiation), 15 were good predictors when measured as deltas (predictors of progression), and 25 were good predictors when both baseline and delta concentrations were used (predictors of initiation and progression). An index score, developed for the latter 25 proteins, provided superior prediction of rapid KF. A subset of these latter proteins was associated with apoptotic processes/TNF receptor signaling pathways.ConclusionsDevelopment of rapid KF in diabetes was preceded by elevated concentrations of multiple circulating proteins both at baseline and during short-term follow-up. Comparing baseline and short-term changes in concentrations of circulating proteins classified predictors of rapid KF risk into those associated with initiation, progression, or both. Predictors of both initiation and progression flagged apoptosis processes and TNF receptor signaling pathways. Multiprotein prognostic algorithms using proteins associated with both initiation and progression improved prediction of rapid KF risk beyond clinical variables.

AB  - Background
   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent and causes serious health complications in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). Early diagnosis of NAFLD is important, as this can help prevent irreversible damage to the liver and, ultimately, hepatocellular carcinomas. We sought to expand etiological understanding and develop a diagnostic tool for NAFLD using machine learning.
   Methods and findings
   We utilized the baseline data from IMI DIRECT, a multicenter prospective cohort study of 3,029 European-ancestry adults recently diagnosed with T2D (n= 795) or at high risk of developing the disease (n= 2,234). Multi-omics (genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) and clinical (liver enzymes and other serological biomarkers, anthropometry, measures of beta-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and lifestyle) data comprised the key input variables. The models were trained on MRI-image-derived liver fat content (<5% or >= 5%) available for 1,514 participants. We applied LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) to select features from the different layers of omics data and random forest analysis to develop the models. The prediction models included clinical and omics variables separately or in combination. A model including all omics and clinical variables yielded a cross-validated receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROCAUC) of 0.84 (95% CI 0.82, 0.86;p <0.001), which compared with a ROCAUC of 0.82 (95% CI 0.81, 0.83;p <0.001) for a model including 9 clinically accessible variables. The IMI DIRECT prediction models outperformed existing noninvasive NAFLD prediction tools. One limitation is that these analyses were performed in adults of European ancestry residing in northern Europe, and it is unknown how well these findings will translate to people of other ancestries and exposed to environmental risk factors that differ from those of the present cohort. Another key limitation of this study is that the prediction was done on a binary outcome of liver fat quantity (<5% or >= 5%) rather than a continuous one.
   Conclusions
   In this study, we developed several models with different combinations of clinical and omics data and identified biological features that appear to be associated with liver fat accumulation. In general, the clinical variables showed better prediction ability than the complex omics variables. However, the combination of omics and clinical variables yielded the highest accuracy. We have incorporated the developed clinical models into a web interface (see:) and made it available to the community.

T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
KW  - KIDNEY INJURY MOLECULE-1
KW  - OBESITY
AB  - Importance Cardiometabolic parameters are established risk factors for COVID-19 severity. The identification of causal or protective biomarkers for COVID-19 severity may facilitate the development of novel therapies.
   Objective To identify protein biomarkers that promote or reduce COVID-19 severity and that mediate the association of cardiometabolic risk factors with COVID-19 severity.
   Design, Setting, and Participants This genetic association study using 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted in 2022 to investigate associations among cardiometabolic risk factors, circulating biomarkers, and COVID-19 hospitalization. Inputs for MR included genetic and proteomic data from 4147 participants with dysglycemia and cardiovascular risk factors collected through the Outcome Reduction With Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial. Genome-wide association study summary statistics were obtained from (1) 3 additional independent plasma proteome studies, (2) genetic consortia for selected cardiometabolic risk factors (including body mass index [BMI], type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and systolic blood pressure; all n >10000), and (3) the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (n=5773 hospitalized and 15497 nonhospitalized case participants with COVID-19). Data analysis was performed in July 2022.
   Exposures Genetically determined concentrations of 235 circulating proteins assayed with a multiplex biomarker panel from the ORIGIN trial for the initial analysis.
   Main Outcomes and Measures Hospitalization status of individuals from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative with a positive COVID-19 test result.
   Results Among 235 biomarkers tested in samples totaling 22101 individuals, MR analysis showed that higher kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) levels reduced the likelihood of COVID-19 hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] per SD increase in KIM-1 levels,0.86 [95% CI, 0.79-0.93]). A meta-analysis validated the protective association with no observed directional pleiotropy (OR per SD increase in KIM-1 levels,0.91 [95% CI, 0.88-0.95]). Of the cardiometabolic risk factors studied, only BMI was associated with KIM-1 levels (0.17 SD increase in biomarker level per 1 kg/m(2) [95% CI, 0.08-0.26]) and COVID-19 hospitalization (OR per 1-SD biomarker level, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.18-1.50]). Multivariable MR analysis also revealed that KIM-1 partially mitigated the association of BMI with COVID-19 hospitalization, reducing it by 10 percentage points (OR adjusted for KIM-1 level per 1 kg/m(2), 1.23 [95% CI, 1.06-1.43]).
   Conclusions and Relevance In this genetic association study, KIM-1 was identified as a potential mitigator of COVID-19 severity, possibly attenuating the increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization among individuals with high BMI. Further studies are required to better understand the underlying biological mechanisms.

AB  - Background Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also now known as long COVID, has become a major global health and economic burden. Previously, we provided evidence that there is a significant insoluble fibrin amyloid microclot load in the circulation of individuals with long COVID, and that these microclots entrap a substantial number of inflammatory molecules, including those that might prevent clot breakdown. Scientifically, the most challenging aspect of this debilitating condition is that traditional pathology tests such as a serum CRP (C-reactive protein) may not show any significant abnormal inflammatory markers, albeit these tests measure only the soluble inflammatory molecules. Elevated, or abnormal soluble biomarkers such as IL-6, D-Dimer or fibrinogen indicate an increased risk for thrombosis or a host immune response in COVID-19. The absence of biomarkers in standard pathology tests, result in a significant amount of confusion for patients and clinicians, as patients are extremely sick or even bed-ridden but with no regular identifiable reason for their disease. Biomarkers that are currently available cannot detect the molecules present in the microclots we identified and are therefore unable to confirm their presence or the mechanisms that drive their formation. Methods Here we analysed the protein content of double-digested microclots of 99 long COVID patients and 29 healthy controls. The patients suffering from long COVID reported their symptoms through a questionnaire completed by themselves or their attending physician. Results Our long COVID cohort's symptoms were found to be in line with global findings, where the most prevalent symptoms were constant fatigue (74%,) cognitive impairment (71%) and depression and anxiety (30%). Our most noteworthy findings were a reduced level of plasma Kallikrein compared to our controls, an increased level of platelet factor 4 (PF4) von Willebrand factor (VWF), and a marginally increased level of alpha-2 antiplasmin (alpha-2-AP). We also found a significant presence of antibodies entrapped inside these microclots. Conclusion Our results confirm the presence of pro-inflammatory molecules that may also contribute to a failed fibrinolysis phenomenon, which could possibly explain why individuals with long COVID suffer from chronic fatigue, dyspnoea, or cognitive impairment. In addition, significant platelet hyperactivation was noted. Hyperactivation will result in the granular content of platelets being shed into the circulation, including PF4. Overall, our results provide further evidence of both a failed fibrinolytic system in long COVID/PASC and the entrapment of many proteins whose presence might otherwise go unrecorded. These findings might have significant implications for individuals with pre-existing comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Protein biomarkers have been identified across many age-related morbidities. However, characterising epigenetic influences could further inform disease predictions. Here, we leverage epigenome-wide data to study links between the DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of the circulating proteome and incident diseases. Using data from four cohorts, we trained and tested epigenetic scores (EpiScores) for 953 plasma proteins, identifying 109 scores that explained between 1% and 58% of the variance in protein levels after adjusting for known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) genetic effects. By projecting these EpiScores into an independent sample (Generation Scotland; n = 9537) and relating them to incident morbidities over a follow-up of 14 years, we uncovered 137 EpiScore-disease associations. These associations were largely independent of immune cell proportions, common lifestyle and health factors, and biological aging. Notably, we found that our diabetes-associated EpiScores highlighted previous top biomarker associations from proteome-wide assessments of diabetes. These EpiScores for protein levels can therefore be a valuable resource for disease prediction and risk stratification.
   eLife digest Although our genetic code does not change throughout our lives, our genes can be turned on and off as a result of epigenetics. Epigenetics can track how the environment and even certain behaviors add or remove small chemical markers to the DNA that makes up the genome. The type and location of these markers may affect whether genes are active or silent, this is, whether the protein coded for by that gene is being produced or not. One common epigenetic marker is known as DNA methylation. DNA methylation has been linked to the levels of a range of proteins in our cells and the risk people have of developing chronic diseases. Blood samples can be used to determine the epigenetic markers a person has on their genome and to study the abundance of many proteins. Gadd, Hillary, McCartney, Zaghlool et al. studied the relationships between DNA methylation and the abundance of 953 different proteins in blood samples from individuals in the German KORA cohort and the Scottish Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. They then used machine learning to analyze the relationship between epigenetic markers found in people's blood and the abundance of proteins, obtaining epigenetic scores or 'EpiScores' for each protein. They found 109 proteins for which DNA methylation patterns explained between at least 1% and up to 58% of the variation in protein levels. Integrating the 'EpiScores' with 14 years of medical records for more than 9000 individuals from the Generation Scotland study revealed 137 connections between EpiScores for proteins and a future diagnosis of common adverse health outcomes. These included diabetes, stroke, depression, Alzheimer's dementia, various cancers, and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Age-related chronic diseases are a growing issue worldwide and place pressure on healthcare systems. They also severely reduce quality of life for individuals over many years. This work shows how epigenetic scores based on protein levels in the blood could predict a person's risk of several of these diseases. In the case of type 2 diabetes, the EpiScore results replicated previous research linking protein levels in the blood to future diagnosis of diabetes. Protein EpiScores could therefore allow researchers to identify people with the highest risk of disease, making it possible to intervene early and prevent these people from developing chronic conditions as they age.
