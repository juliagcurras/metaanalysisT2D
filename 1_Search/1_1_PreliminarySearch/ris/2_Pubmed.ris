AB  - The persistent increase in the worldwide burden of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2D) and the accompanying rise of its complications, including
      cardiovascular disease, necessitates our understanding of the metabolic
      disturbances that cause diabetes mellitus. Metabolomics and proteomics,
      facilitated by recent advances in high-throughput technologies, have given
      us unprecedented insight into circulating biomarkers of T2D even over a
      decade before overt disease. These markers may be effective tools for
      diabetes mellitus screening, diagnosis, and prognosis. As participants of
      metabolic pathways, metabolite and protein markers may also highlight
      pathways involved in T2D development. The integration of metabolomics and
      proteomics with genomics in multiomics strategies provides an analytical
      method that can begin to decipher causal associations. These methods are
      not without their limitations; however, with careful study design and
      sample handling, these methods represent powerful scientific tools that
      can be leveraged for the study of T2D. In this article, we aim to give a
      timely overview of circulating metabolomics and proteomics findings with
      T2D observed in large human population studies to provide the reader with
      a snapshot into these emerging fields of research.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of diabetes and its complications, such as
      cardiovascular and kidney disease, remains a huge burden globally.
      Identification of biomarkers for the screening, diagnosis, and prognosis
      of diabetes and its complications and better understanding of the
      molecular pathways involved in the development and progression of diabetes
      can facilitate individualized prevention and treatment. With the
      advancement of analytical techniques, metabolomics can identify and
      quantify multiple biomarkers simultaneously in a high-throughput manner.
      Providing information on underlying metabolic pathways, metabolomics can
      further identify mechanisms of diabetes and its progression. The
      application of metabolomics in epidemiological studies have identified
      novel biomarkers for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications, such as
      branched-chain amino acids, metabolites of phenylalanine, metabolites
      involved in energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Metabolomics have
      also been applied to explore the potential pathways modulated by
      medications. Investigating diabetes using a systems biology approach by
      integrating metabolomics with other omics data, such as genetics,
      transcriptomics, proteomics, and clinical data can present a comprehensive
      metabolic network and facilitate causal inference. In this regard,
      metabolomics can deepen the molecular understanding, help identify
      potential therapeutic targets, and improve the prevention and management
      of T2D and its complications. The current review focused on metabolomic
      biomarkers for kidney and cardiovascular disease in T2D identified from
      epidemiological studies, and will also provide a brief overview on
      metabolomic investigations for T2D.

AB  - It was unknown whether plasma protein levels can be estimated based on DNA
      methylation (DNAm) levels, and if so, how the resulting surrogates can be
      consolidated into a powerful predictor of lifespan. We present here, seven
      DNAm-based estimators of plasma proteins including those of plasminogen
      activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and growth differentiation factor 15. The
      resulting predictor of lifespan, DNAm GrimAge (in units of years), is a
      composite biomarker based on the seven DNAm surrogates and a DNAm-based
      estimator of smoking pack-years. Adjusting DNAm GrimAge for chronological
      age generated novel measure of epigenetic age acceleration,
      AgeAccelGrim.Using large scale validation data from thousands of
      individuals, we demonstrate that DNAm GrimAge stands out among existing
      epigenetic clocks in terms of its predictive ability for time-to-death
      (Cox regression P=2.0E-75), time-to-coronary heart disease (Cox
      P=6.2E-24), time-to-cancer (P= 1.3E-12), its strong relationship with
      computed tomography data for fatty liver/excess visceral fat, and
      age-at-menopause (P=1.6E-12). AgeAccelGrim is strongly associated with a
      host of age-related conditions including comorbidity count (P=3.45E-17).
      Similarly, age-adjusted DNAm PAI-1 levels are associated with lifespan
      (P=5.4E-28), comorbidity count (P= 7.3E-56) and type 2 diabetes
      (P=2.0E-26). These DNAm-based biomarkers show the expected relationship
      with lifestyle factors including healthy diet and educational
      attainment.Overall, these epigenetic biomarkers are expected to find many
      applications including human anti-aging studies.

AB  - Similar to dementia, the risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) increases with age, and T2DM also increases the risk for dementia,
      particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although T2DM is primarily a
      peripheral disorder and AD is a central nervous system disease, both share
      some common features as they are chronic and complex diseases, and both
      show involvement of oxidative stress and inflammation in their
      progression. These characteristics suggest that T2DM may be associated
      with AD, which gave rise to a new term, type 3 diabetes (T3DM). In this
      study, we searched for matching peripheral proteomic biomarkers of AD and
      T2DM based in a systematic review of the available literature. We
      identified 17 common biomarkers that were differentially expressed in both
      patients with AD or T2DM when compared with healthy controls. These
      biomarkers could provide a useful workflow for screening T2DM patients at
      risk to develop AD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common microvascular
      complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (2-DM). Currently, urine and
      kidney biopsy specimens are the major clinical resources for DKD
      diagnosis. Our study proposes to evaluate the diagnostic value of blood in
      monitoring the onset of DKD and distinguishing its status in the clinic.
      METHODS: This study recruited 1,513 participants including healthy adults
      and patients diagnosed with 2-DM, early-stage DKD (DKD-E), and
      advanced-stage DKD (DKD-A) from 4 independent medical centers. One
      discovery and four testing cohorts were established. Sera were collected
      and subjected to training proteomics and large-scale metabolomics.
      RESULTS: Deep profiling of serum proteomes and metabolomes revealed
      several insights. First, the training proteomics revealed that the
      combination of α2-macroglobulin, cathepsin D, and CD324 could serve as a
      surrogate protein biomarker for monitoring DKD progression. Second,
      metabolomics demonstrated that galactose metabolism and glycerolipid
      metabolism are the major disturbed metabolic pathways in DKD, and serum
      metabolite glycerol-3-galactoside could be used as an independent marker
      to predict DKD. Third, integrating proteomics and metabolomics increased
      the diagnostic and predictive stability and accuracy for distinguishing
      DKD status. CONCLUSIONS: Serum integrative omics provide stable and
      accurate biomarkers for early warning and diagnosis of DKD. Our study
      provides a rich and open-access data resource for optimizing DKD
      management.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common diseases of
      endocrine and metabolic disorders, whose mechanism is still largely
      unknown. Fortunately, various "omics" tools have been employed to better
      understand the progression pathologies of T2DM and its complications. More
      specifically, proteomics, metabolomics and metagenomics have played
      crucial roles in advancing deeper understanding of the physiological
      processes and regulatory mechanisms of T2DM, such as regulation of
      signaling pathways perturbed by glucose levels, intestinal microorganism,
      and inflammation and so on. By analyzing the dynamic change and
      modification of proteins, proteomics has become an important tool in
      biology and medicine. Metabolomic analysis can amplify and quantify
      metabolites in living organisms to reveal the relative relationship
      between metabolites and physiological and pathological changes. There are
      also increasing evidences that the human microbiome, specifically the
      gastrointestinal microbiome have a potential role in the etiology and
      pathological outcomes of T2DM and its complications. This article
      summarized and discussed the recent applications of these "omics" tools in
      finding biomarkers for T2DM and its complications. We also reviewed
      employing multiple "omics" to further advance our understanding of this
      pathology. This review will benefit deeper understanding in new
      therapeutic and/or diagnostic biological target for the discovery of T2DM
      and its complications.

AB  - The incidence of obesity and type diabetes 2 has increased dramatically
      resulting in an increased interest in its biomedical relevance. However,
      the mechanisms that trigger the development of diabetes type 2 in obese
      patients remain largely unknown. Scientific, clinical and pharmaceutical
      communities are dedicating vast resources to unravel this issue by
      applying different omics tools. During the last decade, the advances in
      proteomic approaches and the Human Proteome Organization have opened and
      are opening a new door that may be helpful in the identification of
      patients at risk and to improve current therapies. Here, we briefly review
      some of the advances in our understanding of type 2 diabetes that have
      occurred through the application of proteomics. We also review, in detail,
      the current improvements in proteomic methodologies and new strategies
      that could be employed to further advance our understanding of this
      pathology. By applying these new proteomic advances, novel therapeutic
      and/or diagnostic protein targets will be discovered in the obesity/Type 2
      diabetes area.

AB  - The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 (DM 2) is increasing every
      passing year due to some global changes in lifestyles of people. The exact
      underlying mechanisms of the progression of this disease are not yet
      known. However recent advances in the combined omics more particularly in
      proteomics and genomics have opened a gateway towards the understanding of
      predetermined genetic factors, progression, complications and treatment of
      this disease. Here we shall review the recent advances in proteomics that
      have led to an early and better diagnostic approaches in controlling DM 2
      more importantly the comparison of structural and functional protein
      biomarkers that are modified in the diseased state. By applying these
      advanced and promising proteomic strategies with bioinformatics
      applications and bio-statistical tools the prevalence of DM 2 and its
      associated disorders i-e nephropathy and retinopathy are expected to be
      controlled.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as any degree of glucose
      intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy and it
      affects 18% of pregnant women worldwide. GDM is considered a high-risk
      state which may lead to type II diabetes which is associated with an
      increase in a number of interrelated adverse perinatal outcomes. Given the
      fact that the progress of a successful pregnancy is dependent on the
      intricate communication between several biological molecules,
      identification of the proteomic profile perturbations in women with GDM is
      expected to help in understanding the disease pathogenesis and also
      discovery of clinical biomarker(s). In recent years, both gel-free and
      gel-based proteomics have been extensively investigated for improving
      maternal and child health. Although there are several reports integrating
      various aspects of proteomics in pregnancy related diseases such as
      preeclampsia, extensive Pubmed search shows no review so far on the
      application of proteomics in gestational diabetes. In this review, we
      focus on various high-throughput proteomic technologies for the
      identification of unique biosignatures and biomarkers responsible for the
      early prediction of GDM. Further, different analytical strategies and
      biological samples involved in proteomic analysis of this
      pregnancy-related disease are discussed.This article is part of a Special
      Issue entitled: Proteomics in India.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic multisystem disease. Diabetic
      nephropathy (DN) is one of its significant microvascular complications,
      associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this article
      is to review the literature regarding the latest advances in the
      management of type 2 DM (T2DM) in patients with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD). We initially refer to the screening guidelines, the diagnostic
      tests used, the need for novel biomarkers in DN, the recent advances in
      high-risk patient identification, the recommended glycemic targets, and
      concerns regarding the accuracy of HbA1c in these patients. Then, a
      detailed explanation of the appropriate medical management based on
      evidence from recent trials is presented, analyzed, and discussed. All
      patients with T2DM should be screened for albuminuria at initial diagnosis
      and annually thereafter. Proteomics and metabolomics today represent
      promising diagnostic tools. Optimal glycemic control, with individualized
      HbA1c targets, is fundamental for reduced onset or delayed progression of
      DN and microvascular complications, in general. This can be enhanced by
      lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions when needed.
      Metformin represents the first pharmacological step, with, recently, a
      broadened indication for patients with impaired renal function. If HbA1c
      remains above the target in patients with established CKD, SGLT2i or GLP-1
      RA are the preferred second-line agents, as introduced in all new
      guidelines. This change was the result of recent landmark trials that
      highlighted the superiority of the two aforementioned medication
      categories in terms of both renal and cardiovascular outcomes.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are complex diseases
      commonly associated with aging. Accumulating evidence indicates a
      connection between these two diseases at the molecular level. Much of what
      we currently know about T2D and AD is derived from in vivo and in vitro
      studies. However, further research and characterization of molecules is
      necessary to establish a strong connection between T2D and AD. In silico
      studies play a major role in finding non-evident patterns of gene
      expression and gene network connectivity. In this review, we give a brief
      introduction to T2D and AD and then describe the risk factors and
      molecules that are commonly associated with these diseases. Finally, we
      discuss the future directions and applications of bioinformatics that can
      provide greater insight into the relationship between these two diseases.
      Analysis and integration of high-throughput data on genomics,
      transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics from normal and disease
      tissues would be very useful to improve our understanding of the mechanism
      behind disease initiation and the connection between these two diseases.
      We encourage researchers to use bioinformatics approaches to identify
      genes and their regulatory pathways that are commonly affected in T2D and
      AD, as these genes and pathways could be potential biomarkers and targets
      for disease treatment.

AB  - In recent years, metabolomics has become a necessary tool for
      understanding the impact of external and pathological factors on the
      operation of biological systems. The first reports of metabolomics date
      back to the 1970s, however, the area only began to develop dynamically at
      the beginning of this century and has proved effective only during the
      present decade. The five primary tools used in this form of analysis are
      NMR spectrometry, HPLC, TLC-UV, GC-MS and LC-MS/MS, with MS as the most
      universal approach, particularly when used together with chromatographic
      separation and NMR. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is a rapidly growing
      problem with global consequences. The metabolomic approach has been
      extensively applied to examining T2DM, insulin resistance and obesity, not
      only to assess the development of the disease, but also to discover its
      potential biomarkers. The presented review summarizes current studies on
      lipidomic and proteomic profiles in the context of different types of
      diabetes mellitus disease (T1DM, T2DM and GDM), as determined by
      chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an independent risk factor of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, identifying periphery biomarkers
      correlated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is of importance for early
      diagnosis of AD. Here, we performed platelet proteomics in T2DM patients
      with MCI (T2DM-MCI) and without MCI (T2DM-nMCI). Pearson analysis of the
      omics data with MMSE (mini-mental state examination), Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40
      (β-amyloid), and rGSK-3β(T/S9) (total to Serine-9-phosphorylated glycogen
      synthase kinase-3β) revealed that mitophagy/autophagy-, insulin
      signaling-, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways-related proteins were
      most significantly involved. Among them, only the increase of optineurin,
      an autophagy-related protein, was simultaneously correlated with the
      reduced MMSE score, and the increased Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and rGSK-3β(T/S9), and
      the optineurin alone could discriminate T2DM-MCI from T2DM-nMCI.
      Combination of the elevated platelet optineurin and rGSK-3β(T/S9) enhanced
      the MCI-discriminating efficiency with AUC of 0.927, specificity of 86.7%,
      sensitivity of 85.3%, and accuracy of 0.859, which is promising for
      predicting cognitive decline in T2DM patients.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial condition resulting in high
      fasting blood glucose levels. Although its diagnosis is straightforward,
      there is not one set of biomarkers or drug targets that can be used for
      classification or personalized treatment of individuals who suffer from
      this condition. Instead, the application of multiplex methods
      incorporating a systems biology approach is essential in order to increase
      our understanding of this disease. This chapter reviews the state of the
      art in biomarker studies of human type 2 diabetes from a proteomic and
      metabolomic perspective. Our main focus was on biomarkers for disease
      prediction as these could lead to early intervention strategies for the
      best possible patient outcomes.

      transfer from genome to phenome and represent the largest class of drug
      targets. We review recent advances in high-throughput technologies that
      provide comprehensive, scalable profiling of the plasma proteome with the
      potential to improve prediction and mechanistic understanding of type 2
      diabetes (T2D). RECENT FINDINGS: Technological and analytical advancements
      have enabled identification of novel protein biomarkers and signatures
      that help to address challenges of existing approaches to predict and
      screen for T2D. Genetic studies have so far revealed putative causal roles
      for only few of the proteins that have been linked to T2D, but ongoing
      large-scale genetic studies of the plasma proteome will help to address
      this and increase our understanding of aetiological pathways and
      mechanisms leading to diabetes. Studies of the human plasma proteome have
      started to elucidate its potential for T2D prediction and biomarker
      discovery. Future studies integrating genomic and proteomic data will
      provide opportunities to prioritise drug targets and identify pathways
      linking genetic predisposition to T2D development.

AB  - Recent advances in proteomic technologies have made high-throughput
      profiling of low-abundance proteins in large epidemiological cohorts
      increasingly feasible. We investigated whether aptamer-based proteomic
      profiling could identify biomarkers associated with future development of
      type 2 diabetes (T2DM) beyond known risk factors. We identified dozens of
      markers with highly significant associations with future T2DM across 2
      large longitudinal cohorts (n = 2839) followed for up to 16 years. We
      leveraged proteomic, metabolomic, genetic, and clinical data from humans
      to nominate 1 specific candidate to test for potential causal
      relationships in model systems. Our studies identified functional effects
      of aminoacylase 1 (ACY1), a top protein association with future T2DM risk,
      on amino acid metabolism and insulin homeostasis in vitro and in vivo.
      Furthermore, a loss-of-function variant associated with circulating levels
      of the biomarker WAP, Kazal, immunoglobulin, Kunitz, and NTR
      domain-containing protein 2 (WFIKKN2) was, in turn, associated with
      fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and HOMA-IR measurements in humans. In
      addition to identifying potentially novel disease markers and pathways in
      T2DM, we provide publicly available data to be leveraged for insights
      about gene function and disease pathogenesis in the context of human
      metabolism.

AB  - Diabetic kidney disease occurs in ∼ 25-40% of patients with type 2
      diabetes. Given the high risk of progressive renal function loss and
      end-stage renal disease, early identification of patients with a renal
      risk is important. Novel biomarkers may aid in improving renal risk
      stratification. In this review, we first focus on the classical panel of
      albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate as the primary
      clinical predictors of renal disease and then move our attention to novel
      biomarkers, primarily concentrating on assay-based multiple/panel
      biomarkers, proteomics biomarkers and metabolomics biomarkers. We focus on
      multiple biomarker panels since the molecular processes of renal disease
      progression in type 2 diabetes are heterogeneous, rendering it unlikely
      that a single biomarker significantly adds to clinical risk prediction. A
      limited number of prospective studies of multiple biomarkers address the
      predictive performance of novel biomarker panels in addition to the
      classical panel in type 2 diabetes. However, the prospective studies
      conducted so far have small sample sizes, are insufficiently powered and
      lack external validation. Adequately sized validation studies of multiple
      biomarker panels are thus required. There is also a paucity of studies
      that assess the effect of treatments on novel biomarker panels and
      determine whether initial treatment-induced changes in novel biomarkers
      predict changes in long-term renal outcomes. Such studies can not only
      improve our healthcare but also our understanding of the mechanisms of
      actions of existing and novel drugs and may yield biomarkers that can be
      used to monitor drug response. We conclude that this will be an area to
      focus research on in the future.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes is an expensive public health problem threatening society
      at many levels. Despite many advances in classification of diabetes, we're
      still in early stages of developing an etio-pathologic ontology of
      diabetes. Recognizing the various biologic and social determinants of
      disease outcomes, precision medicine applies to medical interventions as
      well as psychosocial measures, nutrition, and exercise that may also
      affect individuals differently. Using this highly personalized approach,
      one hopes to achieve cost-effective care. The striking evolution in
      generating "Big Data," Biomarker Fingerprints, and the Internet of Things
      will force all clinicians to be familiar with the terminology and
      understand the clinical relevance.

AB  - Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are at increased risk of
      developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this
      study, we attempted to list the proteomic biomarkers of PCOS and T2DM that
      have been published in the literature so far. We identified eight common
      biomarkers that were differentially expressed in both women with PCOS and
      T2DM when compared with healthy controls. These include pyruvate kinase
      M1/M2, apolipoprotein A-I, albumin, peroxiredoxin 2, annexin A2,
      α-1-B-glycoprotein, flotillin-1 and haptoglobin. These biomarkers could
      help improve our understanding of the links between PCOS and T2DM and
      could be potentially used to identify subgroups of women with PCOS at
      increased risk of T2DM. More studies are required to further evaluate the
      role these biomarkers play in women with PCOS and T2DM.

AB  - In the present research work, the levels of protein biomarkers specific to
      diabetes mellitus type 2 in the Pakistani population using proteomic
      technology have been identified and characterized and effect of high dose
      thiamine has been seen on the levels of these marker proteins. Diabetic
      patients and normal healthy controls were recruited from the Sheikh Zayed
      Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Total biochemical assays and proteins were
      estimated by modern proteomic techniques. Some proteins were up- and
      downregulated in diabetic samples as compared to control and decreased
      after thiamine therapy, while other protein markers did not show a
      significant change after the thiamine therapy. The effect of high dose
      thiamine on the levels of these identified protein biomarkers in the human
      urine has also been observed. Assessment of the levels of these biomarkers
      will be helpful in not only early diagnosis but also prognosis of diabetes
      mellitus type 2.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We will summarize recent epidemiological observations
      on the risk for overt diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in nonproteinuric
      patients, will focus on novel studies based on a proteomic biomarker of
      DKD and will discuss the possibility of preventing the progression of DKD
      in nonproteinuric patients by sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2)
      inhibitors. RECENT FINDINGS: Although less frequently than in type 2
      diabetes, DKD may develop also in nonproteinuric type 1 diabetes. However,
      the progression rate to kidney failure in nonproteinuric diabetic people
      is much lower than in proteinuric ones. A new proteomic biomarker, the
      chronic kidney disease (CKD)273, reliably predicts the risk of incident
      micro and macroalbuminuria and of CKD in nonalbuminuric diabetic people.
      SGLT2 inhibition markedly reduces albuminuria in macro and
      microalbuminuric patients and discernibly mitigates albumin excretion also
      in those with albuminuria in the normal range. SUMMARY: Studies focusing
      on risk factors for DKD in nonproteinuric patients are a clinical research
      priority. The CKD273 classifier is a promising biomarker for the early
      identification of nonproteinuric patients at high risk for progressive
      DKD. Empagliflozin and SGLT2 inhibitors may have a favorable impact on the
      progression of DKD in nonalbuminuric diabetic people, a hypothesis to be
      tested in specific clinical trials.

AB  - Risk prediction for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      remains suboptimal even after the introduction of global risk assessment
      by various scores. This has prompted the search for additional biomarkers.
      A variety of blood biomarkers representing various pathophysiological
      pathways of insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, as well as markers of
      subclinical disease and genetic markers, have been investigated. This
      review provides an overview of studies assessing the clinical utility of
      various biomarkers on the basis of hypothesis-driven selection as well as
      hypothesis-free approaches from novel "-omics" technologies. So far, the
      assessment of genotypes and of several candidate biomarkers from blood has
      resulted in only small improvements in the accuracy of prediction of CVD
      and T2D over and above that predicted on the basis of established risk
      factors. Integrated approaches, combining biomarkers from genomics,
      transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, as well as serial
      measurements of biomarkers, are required to make a complete assessment of
      the potential clinical usefulness of biomarkers for risk prediction of
      cardiometabolic disease.

AB  - Objective: Detailed proteomic analysis in a cohort of patients with
      differing severity of COVID-19 disease identified biomarkers within the
      complement and coagulation cascades as biomarkers for disease severity has
      been reported; however, it is unclear if these proteins differ
      sufficiently from other conditions to be considered as biomarkers.
      Methods: A prospective, parallel study in T2D (n = 23) and controls (n =
      23). A hyperinsulinemic clamp was performed and normoglycemia induced in
      T2D [4.5 ± 0.07 mmol/L (81 ± 1.2 mg/dl)] for 1-h, following which blood
      glucose was decreased to ≤2.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dl). Proteomic analysis for
      the complement and coagulation cascades were measured using Slow Off-rate
      Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan. Results: Thirty-four proteins were measured.
      At baseline, 4 of 18 were found to differ in T2D versus controls for
      platelet degranulation [Neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (p = 0.014),
      Thrombospondin-1 (p = 0.012), Platelet factor-4 (p = 0.007), and
      Kininogen-1 (p = 0.05)], whilst 3 of 16 proteins differed for complement
      and coagulation cascades [Coagulation factor IX (p < 0.05), Kininogen-1 (p
      = 0.05), and Heparin cofactor-2 (p = 0.007)]; STRING analysis demonstrated
      the close relationship of these proteins to one another. Induced
      euglycemia in T2D showed no protein changes versus baseline. At
      hypoglycemia, however, four proteins changed in controls from baseline
      [Thrombospondin-1 (p < 0.014), platelet factor-4 (p < 0.01), Platelet
      basic protein (p < 0.008), and Vitamin K-dependent protein-C (p <
      0.00003)], and one protein changed in T2D [Vitamin K-dependent protein-C,
      (p < 0.0002)]. Conclusion: Seven of 34 proteins suggested to be biomarkers
      of COVID-19 severity within the platelet degranulation and complement and
      coagulation cascades differed in T2D versus controls, with further changes
      occurring at hypoglycemia, suggesting that validation of these biomarkers
      is critical. It is unclear if these protein changes in T2D may predict
      worse COVID-19 disease for these patients. Clinical Trial Registration:

AB  - AIMS: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common and severe
      complication to type 2 diabetes. The pathogenesis of DPN is not fully
      known, but several pathways and gene polymorphisms contributing to DPN are
      described. DPN can be studied using nerve biopsies, but studies on the
      proteome of the nerve itself, and its surrounding tissue as a whole, are
      lacking. Studies on the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) have proposed
      PIN a useful indicator of DPN. METHODS: A quantitative mass
      spectrometry-based proteomics analysis was made of peripheral nerves from
      age- and gender-matched living human male tissue donors; nine type 2
      diabetes subjects, with decreased sural nerve action potentials indicating
      DPN, and six controls without type 2 diabetes, with normal
      electrophysiology results. RESULTS: A total of 2617 proteins were
      identified. Linear regression was used to discover which proteins were
      differentially expressed between type 2 diabetes and controls. Only soft
      signals were found. Therefore, clustering of the 500 most variable
      proteins was made to find clusters of similar proteins in type 2 diabetes
      subjects and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study shows,
      for the first time, that the use of quantitative mass spectrometry enables
      quantification of proteins from nerve biopsies from subjects with and
      without type 2 diabetes, which may aid in finding biomarkers of importance
      to DPN development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past decade, researchers have been focused on
      discovering protein biomarkers for diabetic kidney disease. This paper
      aims to search for, analyze, and synthesize current updates regarding the
      development of these efforts. METHODS: We systematically searched the
      ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and PubMed databases for observational
      studies of protein biomarkers in patients with diabetes mellitus. We
      included studies published between January 2018 and April 2020, that were
      based on a population of patients with type-1 or type-2 diabetes mellitus
      aged ⩾18 years, with an observational design such as cross-sectional,
      case-control, or cohort studies. The dependent variable of the research
      results was in the form of protein biomarkers from urine, plasma, or
      serum. RESULTS: Following the screening process, 20 research articles with
      available full text met the inclusion criteria. These could be categorized
      as glomerular biomarkers (ANGPTL4, beta-2 microglobulin, Smad1, and
      glypican-5); inflammatory biomarkers (MCP-1 and adiponectin); and tubular
      biomarkers (NGAL, VDBP, megalin, sKlotho, and KIM-1). The development of a
      panel of biomarkers showed more promising results than those for a single
      biomarker in diagnosing diabetic kidney disease. CONCLUSION: All the
      biomarkers discussed in this review showed promising results for
      predicting diabetic kidney disease because they correlate with
      albuminuria, eGFR, or both. However, of the 11 protein biomarkers, none
      have prognostic value beyond albuminuria and eGFR.

AB  - PURPOSE: Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterized by chronic
      hyperglycemia. So far, the pathogenesis of diabetes has not been fully
      elucidated. Identifying new potential molecule mechanisms and biomarkers
      in this process could contribute to the understanding of pathophysiology.
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Proteomic changes in the liver of type 2 diabetic
      mice (n = 6) and normal mice (n = 6) are studied. Triplicate experiments
      are carried out for each sample. RESULTS: A total of 15 differentially
      expressed proteins (DEPS ) are identified and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
      and Genomes enrichment analysis indicates that DEPS mainly involved two
      inflammatory pathways: glutathione metabolic pathway and the arachidonic
      acid metabolic pathway. The core of protein-protein interaction is the
      tumor necrosis factor inflammatory pathway, indicating the connection
      between inflammation and diabetes. Ten out of fifteen gene transcript
      levels are consistent with proteomics by quantitative RT-PCR validation.
      The transcriptional levels of OAT (ornithine aminotransferase) and
      fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase1 (FBP1) were significantly increased, whereas
      fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) and ef-2 transcription levels
      decreased significantly. In addition, western blotting results showed that
      the expression of OAT and FBP protein increased significantly in the
      diabetes group, while elongation factor 2 decreased significantly and FABP
      do not have significant difference in the diabetes group. CONCLUSIONS AND
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Taken together, the present exploratory liver
      proteomic analysis might be seen as an important starting point for
      studies targeting specific liver proteins aimed at the implementation of
      new biomarkers for the early detection of type 2 diabetes mellitus-related
      potential mechanisms, hoping to provide biomarkers and clinical
      therapeutic targets of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder that severely
      affects human health, but the pathogenesis of the disease remains unknown.
      The high-fat/high-sucrose diets combined with streptozotocin- (STZ-)
      induced nonhuman primate animal model of diabetes are a valuable research
      source of T2DM. Here, we present a study of a STZ rhesus macaque model of
      T2DM that utilizes quantitative iTRAQ-based proteomic method. We compared
      the protein profiles in the liver of STZ-treated macaques as well as
      age-matched healthy controls. We identified 171 proteins differentially
      expressed in the STZ-treated groups, about 70 of which were documented as
      diabetes-related gene in previous studies. Pathway analyses indicated that
      the biological functions of differentially expressed proteins were related
      to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, complements, and
      coagulation cascades. Expression change in tryptophan metabolism pathway
      was also found in this study which may be associations with diabetes. This
      study is the first to explore genome-wide protein expression in hepatic
      tissue of diabetes macaque model using HPLC-Q-TOF/MS technology. In
      addition to providing potential T2DM biomarkers, this quantitative
      proteomic study may also shed insights regarding the molecular
      pathogenesis of T2DM.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disease of the
      brain leading to the irreversible loss of neurons and intellectual
      abilities. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder that is
      characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance
      and relative insulin deficiency. The prevalence of AD and T2DM is
      increasing at an alarming rate and has become a major public health
      concern worldwide. The clinico-pathological relationship between AD and
      T2DM has been debated for more than a decade. Recent epidemiological
      studies have provided direct evidence that T2DM is a strong risk factor
      for AD and numerous studies have demonstrated that patients with diabetes
      have an increased risk of developing AD as compared with healthy
      individuals. The underlying biological mechanisms that link the
      development of diabetes with AD are not fully understood and therefore are
      worth intensive research. The existence of proteomic links between AD and
      diabetes is an important topic currently under active debate. An
      understanding of the complex association between diabetes and AD is
      necessary for the development of novel drug therapies and lifestyle
      guidelines aimed at the treatment and/or prevention of these diseases.
      This review aims to summarize what is currently known about the biological
      and especially proteomic relationships and similarities between these two
      age-related devastating diseases of modern day life. This study may also
      aid in future for the identification of a single or a panel of potential
      blood-based protein biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD and T2DM with
      high sensitivity and specificity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetic Keratopathy (DK) is one of the significant
      complications of type II diabetes (T2DM) with pathogenesis not yet
      clarified. Since hyperglycemia is able to change the protein components
      contained in plasma exosomes, liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is considered as feasible to analyze the
      expression of plasma exosomal proteins in patients with T2DM and
      non-diabetic patients respectively, find critical biological markers, and
      explore the mechanism of DK as well as potential therapeutic targets.
      METHOD: Blood and clinical information of corneal epithelial injury in a
      diabetic group (the study group) and a non-diabetic group (the control
      group), who were patients admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology,
      Yangpu Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine from July 2020 to
      November 2020, were collected. The qEV size exclusion method was adopted
      to separate exosomes from plasma. The exosomes were then identified
      through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking
      analyzer (NTA), and Western blot. The plasma exosomes of the study group
      and the control group were quantitatively analyzed by proteomics. A
      bioinformatics method is utilized to screen differential proteins and the
      expression of the differential proteins was verified by Western blot.
      RESULT: TEM indicated that the exosomes had a double-concave disc-like
      appearance, with a size of about 100 nm, and Western blot expressed as
      CD63 and TSG101. The plasma exosomes of the study group and the control
      group were analyzed by quantitative proteomics with a total number of 952
      proteins detected of which 245 proteins existed in the ExoCarta exosomal
      protein database. Through adoption of P-value to screen credible
      differential proteins, the heat map displayed 28 differential proteins, 7
      upregulated proteins, and 21 downregulated proteins; the volcano map
      displayed 7 upregulated proteins and 22 downregulated proteins; the PPI
      interaction map displayed 12 upregulated proteins and 18 downregulated
      proteins. Through GO enrichment analysis, it was identified that the
      differential protein participated in the main biological processes and was
      involved in regulating the cell's stimulation response to insulin, the
      insulin receptor signaling pathway, and the activity of
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase D as well as anti-oxidation.
      The enriched cell components include main components such as exosomes,
      blood particles, and cytoplasm. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that
      the target protein FLOT2 was mainly concentrated in insulin-related
      signaling pathways. Western blot indicated that the expression of FLOT2 in
      the study group was lower compared with the control group while the
      expression of Exo70 was higher. CONCLUSION: Proteomic analysis of the
      study group and the control group displayed a variety of proteins in
      plasma exosomes. The downregulated protein FLOT2 in the study group was
      closely related to the occurrence, development, and complication of DK in
      T2DM patients. The expression status of plasma FLOT2 protein in T2DM
      patients is expected to be a biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring of
      DK.

AB  - AIMS: Due to the importance of omics approaches in diabetes diagnosis, we
      were assumed to study the scientific activities on omics and type 2
      diabetes worldwide. METHOD: Bibliometric approach was utilized to evaluate
      the documents on proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics in patients with
      type 2 diabetes in the Scopus database from the beginning to 2020. The
      articles were screened by two reviewers and the number of publications and
      citations on omics and type 2 diabetes, top-ranked journals, top-cited
      articles, country co-contributions, co-authorships, author keywords, and
      terms were analyzed. RESULTS: The scientific publications in this field
      consisted of 551 original articles, of which the USA shares the most
      percent, followed by China and Germany. The frequent keywords showed that
      the following hotspots were of interest: "Metabolomics, proteomics, and
      lipidomics as biomarkers for diabetes", "Omics and diabetic nephropathy",
      "The application of omics in obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2
      diabetes". CONCLUSION: This study showed an increasing trend in applying
      omics in type 2 diabetes researches and determined the leading producers
      in this field. Besides, the research hotspots and the main subjects of
      documents were provided for future research and policy decision-making.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a public health problem with a rising incidence
      worldwide. In this study, a potential new biomarker for T2D and mechanisms
      underlying the hypoglycemic effects of Enteromorpha prolifera
      oligosaccharide were investigated. Tandem mass tag labeling with LC-MS/MS
      was used to identify the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between
      the jejunum of diabetic rats and control rats. Correlations between
      glycometabolic parameters and DEPs were revealed by a network analysis.
      The expression levels of target genes in key metabolic pathways were
      further evaluated to identify candidate biomarkers. Among 6810 total
      proteins, approximately 88 % were quantified, of which 148 DEPs with a
      fold change of 1.2 and a corrected p-value of <0.05 were identified. A
      KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the hypoglycaemic effects of E.
      prolifera oligosaccharide involved the PI3K/AKT and extracellular matrix
      receptor interaction signaling pathways. More importantly, Col1a1 was the
      most significant gene in the extracellular matrix receptor interaction
      pathway and was linked to hypoglycaemic activity for the first time. Thus,
      Col1a1 is a novel potential therapeutic target for alleviating T2D.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome is a complex endocrine disorder affecting
      numerous women of reproductive age across the globe. Characterized mainly
      by irregular menses, hirsutism, skewed LH: FSH ratios and bulky polycystic
      ovaries, this multifactorial endocrinopathy results in unfavorable
      reproductive and metabolic sequelae, including anovulatory infertility,
      type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease in later
      years. Increasing evidence has shown that the manifestation of polycystic
      ovary syndrome (PCOS) is attributable to a cumulative impact of altered
      genetic, epigenetic and protein profiles which bring about a systemic
      dysfunction. While genetic approaches help ascertain role of causal
      variants in its etiology, tissue-specific epigenetic patterns help in
      deciphering the auxiliary role of environmental, nutritional and
      behavioral factors. Proteomics is advantageous, linking both genotype and
      phenotype and contributing to biomarker discovery. Investigating molecular
      mechanism underlying PCOS is imperative in order to gain insight into the
      pathophysiology of PCOS and formulate novel diagnostic and treatment
      strategies. In this review we have summarized these three aspects, which
      have been successfully utilized to delineate the pathomechanisms of PCOS.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have increased
      risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), encompassing myocardial infarction,
      stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. We hypothesized that those
      biomarkers indicative of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) seen in large vessel
      occlusion (LVO) may also be elevated in T2D and further enhanced by stress
      conditions; therefore, these proteins represent potentially predictive
      biomarkers for those T2D patients at high risk of AIS. Methods: We
      performed an exploratory proteomic analysis in control subjects (n = 23)
      versus those with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (n = 23) who underwent a
      hyperinsulinemic clamp study to transient severe hypoglycemia [blood
      glucose <2.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dl)] in a prospective case-control study. We
      compared these proteins described as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers
      for AIS due to LVO: lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid
      receptor-1 (LYVE1), thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), pro-platelet basic protein
      (PPBP), and cadherin 1 (CDH1). Results: At baseline (BL), PPBP (p < 0.05),
      THBS1 (p < 0.05), and CDH1 (p < 0.01) were elevated in T2D; LYVE1 was not
      different between controls and T2D subjects at BL or at subsequent
      timepoints. PPBP and THBS1 tended to increase at hypoglycemia in both
      cohorts, though reached significance only in controls (p < 0.05),
      returning to BL levels post-hypoglycemia. CDH1 levels were higher in T2D
      at BL, at hypoglycemia and up to 2-h posthypoglycemia, thereafter
      reverting to BL levels. Conclusion: Elevated levels of PPBP, THBS1, and
      CDH1, circulatory proteins suggested as biomarkers of AIS due to LVO, may,
      in T2D patients, be prognostically indicative of a cohort of T2D patients
      at increased risk of ischaemic stroke. Prospective studies are needed to
      determine if this reflects future clinical risk. Clinical trial reg. no:

AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease encompasses a spectrum of liver
      diseases, including simple steatosis, steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis and
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
      is currently the most dominant chronic liver disease in Western countries
      due to the fact that hepatic steatosis is associated with insulin
      resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome and
      drug-induced injury. A variety of chemicals, mainly drugs, and diets is
      known to cause hepatic steatosis in humans and rodents. Experimental
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease models rely on the application of a diet
      or the administration of drugs to laboratory animals or the exposure of
      hepatic cell lines to these drugs. More recently, genetically modified
      rodents or zebrafish have been introduced as non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease models. Considerable interest now lies in the discovery and
      development of novel non-invasive biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease, with specific focus on hepatic steatosis. Experimental diagnostic
      biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, such as (epi)genetic
      parameters and '-omics'-based read-outs are still in their infancy, but
      show great promise. In this paper, the array of tools and models for the
      study of liver steatosis is discussed. Furthermore, the current
      state-of-art regarding experimental biomarkers such as epigenetic,
      genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabonomic biomarkers will be
      reviewed.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers of
      diabetic vascular dementia (DVD) and unravel the underlying mechanisms
      using mass spectrometry (MS). Methods: Label-free liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomic analysis was
      applied to urine samples from four groups, including 14 patients with
      vascular dementia (VD), 22 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
      12 patients with DVD, and 21 normal controls (NCs). Searching the MS data
      by Proteome Discoverer software (ThermoFisher Scientific; Waltham, MA,
      USA), protein abundances were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively
      and compared between these groups. Combining bioinformatics analysis using
      Gene Ontology (GO), pathway crosstalk analysis using Kyoto Encyclopedia of
      Genes and Genomes (KEGG), protein-protein interaction (PPI) network
      analysis using STRING, and literature searching, the differentially
      expressed proteins (DEPs) of DVD can be comprehensively judged and were
      further quantified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
      methods. Results: The proteomic findings showed quantitative changes in
      patients with DVD compared to patients with NC, T2DM, and VD groups; among
      4,744 identified urine proteins, 1,222, 1,152, and 1,180 proteins
      displayed quantitative changes unique to DVD vs. NC, T2DM, and VD,
      respectively, including 481 overlapped common DEPs. Then, nine unique
      proteins [including HP, SERPIND, ATP5PB, VNN2, ALDH3A1, U2AF2, C6,
      A0A5C2GRG5 (no name), and A0A5C2FZ29 (no name)] and two composite markers
      (CM) (A0A5C2GRG5+U2AF2 and U2AF2+C6) were confirmed by a ROC curve method.
      Conclusion: This study provided an insight into the potential pathogenesis
      of DVD and elucidated a method for early detection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Elevated glycolytic enzymes in renal glomeruli correlated with
      preservation of renal function in the Medalist Study, individuals with ≥50
      years of type 1 diabetes. Specifically, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)
      activation protected insulin-deficient diabetic mice from
      hyperglycemia-induced glomerular pathology. This study aims to extend
      these findings in a separate cohort of individuals with type 1 and type 2
      diabetes and discover new circulatory biomarkers for renal protection
      through proteomics and metabolomics of Medalists' plasma. We hypothesize
      that increased glycolytic flux and improved mitochondrial biogenesis will
      halt the progression of diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
      Immunoblots analyzed selected glycolytic and mitochondrial enzymes in
      postmortem glomeruli of non-Medalists with type 1 diabetes (n = 15), type
      2 diabetes (n = 19), and no diabetes (n = 5). Plasma proteomic (SOMAscan)
      (n = 180) and metabolomic screens (n = 214) of Medalists with and without
      stage 3b chronic kidney disease (CKD) were conducted and significant
      markers validated by ELISA. RESULTS: Glycolytic (PKM1, PKM2, and ENO1) and
      mitochondrial (MTCO2) enzymes were significantly elevated in glomeruli of
      CKD- versus CKD+ individuals with type 2 diabetes. Medalists' plasma PKM2
      correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (r 2 = 0.077; P =
      0.0002). Several glucose and mitochondrial enzymes in circulation were
      upregulated with corresponding downregulation of toxic metabolites in
      CKD-protected Medalists. Amyloid precursor protein was also significantly
      upregulated, tumor necrosis factor receptors downregulated, and both
      confirmed by ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of enzymes involved in the
      metabolism of intracellular free glucose and its metabolites in renal
      glomeruli is connected to preserving kidney function in both type 1 and
      type 2 diabetes. The renal profile of elevated glycolytic enzymes and
      reduced toxic glucose metabolites is reflected in the circulation,
      supporting their use as biomarkers for endogenous renal protective factors
      in people with diabetes.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a metabolic disorder characterized by high
      blood glucose due to insulin deficiency or resistance. Alzheimer's disease
      (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease leading to irreversible loss
      of neurons, intellectual abilities, memory and reasoning. The worldwide
      prevalence of diabetes and AD in elderly population is a major public
      health concern. Interestingly, both health issues are unraveling the
      puzzling links. The clinico-pathological relationship between diabetes and
      AD has been reported at genomic and proteomic levels. The association of
      virus infection in type 2 diabetes mellitus and AD has been reported in
      few recent studies, some have shown direct evidence of virus infection in
      diabetes and AD while other have shown that diabetes increases the risk of
      developing AD. This review aims to summarize the association of few common
      viruses like Hepatitis C Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus-1 which affects
      both these two age-related devastating diseases. We also discuss the
      pathological links of Influenza virus, Cytomegalovirus, West Nile virus,
      Enterovirus, Herpes Simplex Virus-2, Hepatitis viruses in diabetes and
      Influenza virus, Picornavirus and Borna disease virus in AD. Establishing
      such relationships and defining their common pathogenesis and
      patho-physiological mechanisms may lead to new concepts and paths for
      developing novel preventive strategies and pharmacological treatment
      options for diabetes and AD. This study may aid in future for the
      identification of a single or a panel of likely blood-based viral
      biomarkers for early diagnosis of diabetes and AD with high sensitivity
      and specificity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To monitor of type 2 diabetes more simply, conveniently and
      noninvasively, we are trying to identify the potential urinary peptides
      that associated with different stages of glucose control in type 2
      diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Firstly, we collected urine samples from type
      2 diabetic patients and normal controls. These type 2 diabetic patients
      were divided into two groups according to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and
      hemoglobin A1c% (HbA1c), respectively. Magnetic beads based weak cation
      exchange chromatography (MB-WCX) was used to condense urinary peptides.
      The eluates were then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser
      desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS).
      Subsequently, ClinProt was used to profile and screen the polypeptide
      patterns based on different methods of grouping in diabetic patients and
      normal controls. Finally, the amino acid sequences of differentially
      expressed peptides were identified by nano-liquid chromatography-tandem
      mass spectrometry and the protein sources of the corresponding peptide
      were matched in IPI Human database. RESULTS: Proteomics analysis found two
      up-regulated peptide (m/z 2756.1 and m/z 3223.2) representations in
      diabetic subjects, and the two peptides increased with increases in the
      amount of glycosylated hemoglobin. Further, the parallelism between m/z
      3223.2 and glycosylated hemoglobin was better than the parallelism between
      m/z 2756.1 and glycosylated hemoglobin. Area under the receiver operating
      characteristic of the two peptides was 0.722 and 0.661, respectively. The
      above-mentioned peptide m/z 2756.1 was further identified as fragment of
      fibrinogen alpha chain precursor and m/z 3223.2 was fragment of
      prothrombin precursor. CONCLUSION: These results suggested the two urinary
      biomarkers enable monitor of type 2 diabetes patients with different
      stages of glucose control.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect urinary proteomic profiling of patients with type 2
      diabetes by using ProteinChip array technology, for searching new
      potential biomarkers in early diagnosis of type 2 diabetic nephropathy
      (T2DN). METHODS: A total of 95 urine samples from type 2 diabetic patients
      with normoalbuminuria (DM, n=30), microalbuminuria (DNl, n=25) and
      macroalbuminuria (DN2, n=20), and healthy controls (n=20) were analyzed by
      SELDI-TOF-MS (the surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry) technology combined with bioinformatics
      tools. RESULTS: Over 300 proteins or peptides from 1 to 80 kDa were
      obtained using ProteinChip. About 40 of them with the m/z values from
      2008.78 to 79176.55 Da were significantly differentiated between type 2
      diabetic patients and control subjects. Four proteins of mass 2797.03,
      4545.77, 4984.03 and 9083.71 Da were selected as the potential biomarkers
      for T2DN with sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 96.7%. CONCLUSION:
      ProteinChip technology can help to discover new biomarkers and provide a
      novel non-invasive tool to early diagnosis of T2DN.

AB  - Insulin resistance (IR) is a precursor of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and
      improved risk prediction and understanding of the pathogenesis are needed.
      We used a novel high-throughput 92-protein assay to identify circulating
      biomarkers for HOMA of IR in two cohorts of community residents without
      diabetes (n = 1,367) (mean age 73 ± 3.6 years). Adjusted linear regression
      identified cathepsin D and confirmed six proteins (leptin, renin,
      interleukin-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1ra], hepatocyte growth factor,
      fatty acid-binding protein 4, and tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA]) as
      IR biomarkers. Mendelian randomization analysis indicated a positive
      causal effect of IR on t-PA concentrations. Two biomarkers, IL-1ra (hazard
      ratio [HR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59) and t-PA (HR 1.30, 1.02-1.65) were
      associated with incident T2D, and t-PA predicted 5-year transition to
      hyperglycemia (odds ratio 1.30, 95% CI 1.02-1.65). Additional adjustment
      for fasting glucose rendered both coefficients insignificant and revealed
      an association between renin and T2D (HR 0.79, 0.62-0.99). LASSO
      regression suggested a risk model including IL-1ra, t-PA, and the
      Framingham Offspring Study T2D score, but prediction improvement was
      nonsignificant (difference in C-index 0.02, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.12) over the
      T2D score only. In conclusion, proteomic blood profiling indicated
      cathepsin D as a new IR biomarker and suggested a causal effect of IR on
      t-PA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The clinical research on BH4 is limited because of the
      difficulties on its measurement. In this study, we used our own
      established LC-MS/MS method to examine the plasma BH4 levels in diabetes
      to determine whether it could be used as a biomarker for the prediction of
      kidney injury in those patients. METHODS: Hospitalized diabetes patients
      in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan to Aug 2021 were
      recruited. To assess the association between plasma BH4 with ACR or eGFR
      in diabetes, a total of 142 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) were
      enrolled. They were divided into three groups by albuminuria levels:
      normoalbuminuria (n = 68), microalbuminuria (n = 48), and macroalbuminuria
      (n = 26) according to ACR; or into two groups by eGFR: eGFR≥90 or eGFR<90
      ml/min for correlation and logistic regression analysis. Plasma BH4 level
      was measured by LC-MS/MS along with other biochemical indices. RESULTS:
      Plasma BH4 concentrations were decreased as ACR progressed. BH4 (r =
      -0.55, P < 0.001) and 2h C-Peptide (CP-2h) (r = -0.248, P = 0.003) levels
      were negatively correlated with ACR. Moreover, multivariable logistic
      regression analysis showed BH4 concentrations (B = -0.468, P < 0.001) and
      CP-2h (B = -0.257, P = 0.028) were independently associated with ACR
      progression. ROC curve showed that BH4 level has a predictive value on ACR
      (95%CI 0.686-0.841, sensitivity 69.1%, specificity 73%). Moreover, in
      diabetes patients with eGFR≥90 ml/min, plasma BH4 level (P = 0.008) is
      higher than those in diabetes with eGFR<90 ml/min and BH4 was remained
      independently associated with eGFR after multivariable logistic regression
      analysis (B = -0.193, P = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Our established LC-MS/MS
      method could be used on human plasma BH4 measurements and our data
      suggested that BH4 level can be used as a biomarker for kidney injury in
      diabetes indicated by its association with ACR progression and early renal
      function decline.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a disease associated with a number of
      metabolic disturbances, including protein metabolism. In the present
      study, blood samples were obtained from Bahraini subjects, including 6
      patients with T2DM and 6 age‑ and sex‑matched, non‑diabetic, healthy
      controls. Depleted and non‑depleted sera were prepared from the collected
      blood, and the global protein expression changes were evaluated by liquid
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Only significantly and markedly
      differentially‑expressed proteins (P<0.05, analysis of variance; maximum
      fold change ≥1.5) were considered as candidate proteins for informatics
      analysis. Accordingly, a total of 62 proteins were identified to be
      differentially expressed in T2DM, compared with control subjects, and they
      were grouped functionally into 16 classes of proteins. The largest class
      was that of the immune‑associated proteins. Additionally, ~25 of these
      proteins (40%) had previously been associated with DM; however, the
      association of the other 37 proteins with T2DM was a novel observation.
      The majority of the identified proteins were upregulated in T2DM. The
      identified proteins could be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease
      or serve as disease biomarkers. Further validation of the identified
      proteins in a large study cohort is required, in order to fully access
      their potential clinical usefulness.

AB  - Human saliva plays a pivotal role in digesting food and maintaining oral
      hygiene. The presence of electrolytes, mucus, glycoproteins, enzymes,
      antibacterial compounds, and gingival crevicular fluid in saliva ensures
      the optimum condition of oral cavity and general health condition. Saliva
      collection has been proven non-invasive, convenient, and inexpensive
      compared to conventional venipuncture procedure. These distinctive
      advantages provide a promising potential of saliva as a diagnostic fluid.
      Through comprehensive analysis, an array of salivary proteins and peptides
      may be beneficial as biomarkers in oral and systemic diseases. In this
      review, we discuss the utility of human salivary proteomes and tabulate
      the recent salivary biomarkers found in subjects with acute myocardial
      infarction as well as respective methods employed. In a clinical setting,
      since acute myocardial infarction contributes to large cases of mortality
      worldwide, an early intervention using these biomarkers will provide an
      effective solution to reduce global heart attack incidence particularly
      among its high-risk group of type-2 diabetes mellitus patients. The
      utility of salivary biomarkers will make the prediction of this cardiac
      event possible due to its reliability hence improve the quality of life of
      the patients. Current challenges in saliva collection are also addressed
      to improve the quality of saliva samples and produce robust biomarkers for
      future use in clinical applications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is thought to be a risk factor
      for endometrial hyperplasia, but potential links between the two diseases
      are unknown. This study aims to evaluate the role of T2DM in the
      progression of endometrial hyperplasia. METHODS: Female Sprague-Dawley
      rats were randomly divided into normal (N) group, endometrial hyperplasia
      (NH) group, T2DM (T) group, and endometrial hyperplasia with T2DM (TH)
      group. Proteomics analysis was performed to determine the protein profile
      of endometrial tissues. Proliferation, migration, and invasion of cells
      with/without GLANT2-knockdown were assessed. Immunohistochemical staining
      and ELISA were used to examine the expression of GALNT2 in endometrial
      tissues and serum of clinical samples. RESULTS: The highest uterus index
      and endometrial thickness were observed in TH group, with the expression
      of proliferation marker PCNA increased significantly, indicating that T2DM
      facilitates the progress of endometrial hyperplasia. Proteomics analysis
      showed that there were significant differences in protein profiles among
      groups and differential proteins were mainly enriched in metabolic
      pathways. Further verification by molecular biology analysis indicated
      that GALNT2 is the key target for T2DM facilitating endometrial
      hyperplasia. The expression of GALNT2 was significantly decreased in high
      glucose environment. T2DM could synergize the proliferative function of
      GALNT2 aberration by activating EGFR/AKT/ERK pathway. The decreased
      expressions of GALNT2 in clinical samples were associated with worse
      subtypes of endometrial hyperplasia. CONCLUSION: T2DM promoted the
      progression of endometrial hyperplasia by regulating the GALNT2-mediated
      phosphorylation of EGFR and enhancing cell proliferation. GALNT2 has the
      potential to be a novel biomarker in the treatment of endometrial
      hyperplasia.

AB  - Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the most common diabetic
      complications, as well as the leading cause of chronic kidney disease and
      end-stage renal disease around the world. To prevent the dreadful
      consequence, development of new assays for diagnostic of DKD has always
      been the priority in the research field of diabetic complications. At
      present, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR) are the standard methods for assessing glomerular
      damage and renal function changes in clinical practice. However, due to
      diverse tissue involvement in different individuals, the so-called
      "non-albuminuric renal impairment" is not uncommon, especially in patients
      with type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, the precision of creatinine-based
      GFR estimates is limited in hyperfiltration status. These facts make
      albuminuria and eGFR less reliable indicators for early-stage DKD. In
      recent years, considerable progress has been made in the understanding of
      the pathogenesis of DKD, along with the elucidation of its genetic
      profiles and phenotypic expression of different molecules. With the help
      of ever-evolving technologies, it has gradually become plausible to apply
      the thriving information in clinical practice. The strength and weakness
      of several novel biomarkers, genomic, proteomic and metabolomic signatures
      in assisting the early diagnosis of DKD will be discussed in this article.

AB  - Currently, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity are major global
      public health issues, and their prevalence in the United Arab Emirates
      (UAE) are among the highest in the world. In 2019, The UAE diabetes
      national prevalence was 15.4%. In recent years there has been a
      considerable investigation of predictive biomarkers associated with these
      conditions. This study analysed fasting (8 h) blood samples from an obese,
      normoglycemic cohort and an obese, T2DM cohort of UAE nationals, employing
      clinical chemistry analysis, 1D 1H NMR and mass spectroscopy (FIA-MS/MS
      and LC-MS/MS) techniques. The novel findings reported for the first time
      in a UAE population revealed significant differences in a number of
      metabolites in the T2DM cohort. Metabolic fingerprints identified by NMR
      included BCAAs, trimethylamine N-oxide, β-hydroxybutyrate, trimethyl uric
      acid, and alanine. A targeted MS approach showed significant differences
      in lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, acylcarnitine, amino
      acids and sphingomyelins; Lyso.PC.a.C18.0, PC.ae.C34.2, C3.DC..C4.OH,
      glutamine and SM.C16.1, being the most significant metabolites. Pearson's
      correlation studies showed associations between these metabolites and the
      clinical chemistry parameters across both cohorts. This report identified
      differences in metabolites in response to T2DM in agreement with many
      published population studies. This contributes to the global search for a
      bank of metabolite biomarkers that can predict the advent of T2DM and give
      insight to its pathogenic mechanisms.

AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Multiplex proteomics could improve understanding and risk
      prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in type 2
      diabetes. This study assessed 80 cardiovascular and inflammatory proteins
      for biomarker discovery and prediction of MACE in type 2 diabetes.
      METHODS: We combined data from six prospective epidemiological studies of
      30-77-year-old individuals with type 2 diabetes in whom 80 circulating
      proteins were measured by proximity extension assay.
      Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used in a discovery/replication
      design to identify biomarkers for incident MACE. We used gradient-boosted
      machine learning and lasso regularised Cox regression in a random 75%
      training subsample to assess whether adding proteins to risk factors
      included in the Swedish National Diabetes Register risk model would
      improve the prediction of MACE in the separate 25% test subsample.
      RESULTS: Of 1211 adults with type 2 diabetes (32% women), 211 experienced
      a MACE over a mean (±SD) of 6.4 ± 2.3 years. We replicated associations
      (<5% false discovery rate) between risk of MACE and eight proteins: matrix
      metalloproteinase (MMP)-12, IL-27 subunit α (IL-27a), kidney injury
      molecule (KIM)-1, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23, protein S100-A12, TNF
      receptor (TNFR)-1, TNFR-2 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
      receptor (TRAIL-R)2. Addition of the 80-protein assay to established risk
      factors improved discrimination in the separate test sample from 0.686
      (95% CI 0.682, 0.689) to 0.748 (95% CI 0.746, 0.751). A sparse model of 20
      added proteins achieved a C statistic of 0.747 (95% CI 0.653, 0.842) in
      the test sample. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We identified eight protein
      biomarkers, four of which are novel, for risk of MACE in community
      residents with type 2 diabetes, and found improved risk prediction by
      combining multiplex proteomics with an established risk model.
      Multiprotein arrays could be useful in identifying individuals with type 2
      diabetes who are at highest risk of a cardiovascular event.

AB  - AIMS: To seek urinary peptides as biomarkers distinguishing type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients from healthy controls. METHODS: Random
      urine samples obtained from 28 patients with T2DM and 29 healthy
      individuals were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) after purification using
      weak cationic-exchange magnetic beads (MB-WCX). Then the generated mass
      spectra of peptides were analyzed by ClinProTools2.1 bioinformatics
      software. Subsequently, the amino acid sequences of differently expressed
      peptides were identified by a nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry and a Sequest search found the corresponding protein name.
      RESULTS: Three differently expressed peptides and their mass to charge
      ratios (m/z) were found. Compared with healthy controls, the peak areas of
      the three differently expressed peptides were all reduced in T2DM, and the
      m/z were 1056.1 (m/z), 1963.5 (m/z), 2123.5 (m/z), respectively. The
      above-mentioned peptides were further identified as fragments of histidine
      triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1), bifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA
      synthetase (EPRS), and clusterin precursor protein (CLU). CONCLUSIONS:
      Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1, bifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA
      synthetase, and clusterin precursor protein may serve as potential
      biomarkers distinguishing type 2 diabetes mellitus patients from healthy
      controls.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The urinary proteomic classifier CKD273 has shown promise for
      prediction of progressive diabetic nephropathy (DN). Whether it is also a
      determinant of mortality and cardiovascular disease in patients with
      microalbuminuria (MA) is unknown. METHODS: Urine samples were obtained
      from 155 patients with type 2 diabetes and confirmed microalbuminuria.
      Proteomic analysis was undertaken using capillary electrophoresis coupled
      to mass spectrometry to determine the CKD273 classifier score. A
      previously defined CKD273 threshold of 0.343 for identification of DN was
      used to categorise the cohort in Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models
      with all-cause mortality as the primary endpoint. Outcomes were traced
      through national health registers after 6 years. RESULTS: CKD273
      correlated with urine albumin excretion rate (UAER) (r = 0.481, p =
      <0.001), age (r = 0.238, p = 0.003), coronary artery calcium (CAC) score
      (r = 0.236, p = 0.003), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide
      (NT-proBNP) (r = 0.190, p = 0.018) and estimated glomerular filtration
      rate (eGFR) (r = 0.265, p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis only UAER (β
      = 0.402, p < 0.001) and eGFR (β = - 0.184, p = 0.039) were statistically
      significant determinants of CKD273. Twenty participants died during
      follow-up. CKD273 was a determinant of mortality (log rank [Mantel-Cox] p
      = 0.004), and retained significance (p = 0.048) after adjustment for age,
      sex, blood pressure, NT-proBNP and CAC score in a Cox regression model.
      CONCLUSION: A multidimensional biomarker can provide information on
      outcomes associated with its primary diagnostic purpose. Here we
      demonstrate that the urinary proteomic classifier CKD273 is associated
      with mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes and MA even when
      adjusted for other established cardiovascular and renal biomarkers.

AB  - This study aimed to obtain information on bile acid profiles in diabetic
      (db/db) mice and their wild type (wt) littermates for the understanding of
      pathogenesis and discovery of potential biomarkers of type 2 diabetes.
      Analytical methods based on protein precipitation or solid-phase
      extraction together with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
      were developed for the determination of 25 bile acids in plasma, urine and
      feces samples collected from db/db and wt mice. GLP-1 concentration and
      hepatic genes related to bile acid synthesis were also investigated. The
      results showed that the concentrations of individual bile acids varied
      notably both interindividually and temporally. However, plasma, urine and
      feces samples displayed discriminating bile acid profiles between the
      db/db and wt groups, with the plasma profile showing the best
      differentiation capacity. In plasma and urine, the concentration variation
      of taurine-conjugated bile acids was more correlated with that of other
      taurine-conjugated bile acids, and vice versa for the unconjugated bile
      acids. Transcription of hepatic gene Cyp7b1 was downregulated, and Hsd3b7
      upregulated in db/db mice. In conclusion, the bile acid profile,
      particularly that in plasma, can distinguish the two animal groups and is
      a promising biomarker for type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become the most frequent cause of chronic
      kidney disease worldwide due to the constant increase of the incidence of
      type 2 diabetes mellitus in developed and developing countries. The
      understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of human diseases
      through a large-scale characterization of the protein content of a
      biological sample is the key feature of the proteomics approach to the
      study of human disease. We discuss the main results of over 10 years of
      tissue and urine proteomics studies applied to DN in order to understand
      how far we have come and how far we still have to go before obtaining a
      full comprehension of the molecular mechanisms involved in the
      pathogenesis of DN and identifying reliable biomarkers for accurate
      management of patients.

AB  - Metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and metabolic syndrome (MetS)
      are alarming health burdens around the world, while therapies for these
      diseases are far from satisfying as their etiologies are not completely
      clear yet. T2DM, NAFLD, and MetS are all complex and multifactorial
      metabolic disorders based on the interactions between genetics and
      environment. Omics studies such as genetics, transcriptomics, epigenetics,
      proteomics, and metabolomics are all promising approaches in accurately
      characterizing these diseases. And the most effective treatments for
      individuals can be achieved via omics pathways, which is the theme of
      precision medicine. In this review, we summarized the multi-omics studies
      of T2DM, NAFLD, and MetS in recent years, provided a theoretical basis for
      their pathogenesis and the effective prevention and treatment, and
      highlighted the biomarkers and future strategies for precision medicine.

AB  - Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) identify genes that are
      dysregulated by the studied clinical endpoints, thereby indicating
      potential new diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets and therapy options.
      Combining EWAS with deep molecular phenotyping, such as approaches enabled
      by metabolomics and proteomics, allows further probing of the underlying
      disease-associated pathways. For instance, methylation of the TXNIP gene
      is associated robustly with prevalent type 2 diabetes and further with
      metabolites that are short-term markers of glycaemic control. These
      associations reflect TXNIP's function as a glucose uptake regulator by
      interaction with the major glucose transporter GLUT1 and suggest that
      TXNIP methylation can be used as a read-out for the organism's exposure to
      glucose stress. Another case is the association between DNA methylation of
      the AHRR and F2RL3 genes with smoking and a protein that is involved in
      the reprogramming of the bronchial epithelium. These examples show that
      associations between DNA methylation and intermediate molecular traits can
      open new windows into how the body copes with physiological challenges.
      This knowledge, if carefully interpreted, may indicate novel therapy
      options and, together with monitoring of the methylation state of specific
      methylation sites, may in the future allow the early diagnosis of
      impending disease. It is essential for medical practitioners to recognize
      the potential that this field holds in translating basic research findings
      to clinical practice. In this review, we present recent advances in the
      field of EWAS with metabolomics and proteomics and discuss both the
      potential and the challenges of translating epigenetic associations, with
      deep molecular phenotypes, to biomedical applications.

AB  - AIMS: Recent evidence points towards a distinct obese phenotype among
      patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We
      aimed to identify differentially expressed circulating biomarkers in obese
      HFpEF patients and link them to disease severity and outcomes. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: From the LIFE-Heart study, 999 patients with HFpEF and 999
      patients without heart failure (no-HF) were selected and 92 circulating
      serum biomarkers were measured using a proximity extension assay.
      Elevation of identified biomarkers was validated in 220 patients from the
      Aldo-DHF trial with diagnosed HFpEF. HFpEF patients were older and had
      more comorbidities including coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes
      as compared to no-HF patients (P < 0.05 for all). After adjusting for
      covariates, adrenomedullin (ADM), galectin-9 (Gal-9), thrombospondin-2
      (THBS-2), CD4, and tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
      ligand receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) were significantly higher in obese HFpEF
      patients [body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 , n = 464] as compared to lean
      HFpEF (BMI <30 kg/m2 , n = 535) and obese no-HF patients (BMI ≥30 kg/m2 ,
      n = 387) (P < 0.001 for both); these findings were verified in the
      Aldo-DHF validation cohort (P < 0.001). Except for CD4 these proteins were
      associated with increased estimates of left atrial pressure in a linear
      fashion. Importantly, ADM and CD4 were associated with increased mortality
      in obese HFpEF patients after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSION: Obese
      HFpEF patients exhibit higher circulating biomarkers of volume expansion
      (ADM), myocardial fibrosis (THBS-2) and systemic inflammation (Gal-9, CD4)
      compared to obese non-HFpEF or lean HFpEF patients. These findings support
      the clinical definition of a distinct obese HFpEF phenotype and might
      merit further investigation.

AB  - Bariatric surgery restores glucose tolerance in many, but not all,
      severely obese subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aimed to evaluate
      the plasma protein profiles associated with the T2D remission after
      obesity surgery. We recruited seventeen women with severe obesity
      submitted to bariatric procedures, including six non-diabetic patients and
      eleven patients with T2D. After surgery, diabetes remitted in 7 of the 11
      patients with T2D. Plasma protein profiles at baseline and 6 months after
      bariatric surgery were analyzed by two-dimensional differential gel
      electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and matrix-assisted laser
      desorption/ionization-time-of-flight/time-of-flight coupled to mass
      spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS). Remission of T2D following bariatric
      procedures was associated with changes in alpha-1-antichymotrypsin
      (SERPINA 3, p < 0.05), alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M, p < 0.005),
      ceruloplasmin (CP, p < 0.05), fibrinogen beta chain (FBG, p < 0.05),
      fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG, p < 0.05), gelsolin (GSN, p < 0.05),
      prothrombin (F2, p < 0.05), and serum amyloid p-component (APCS, p <
      0.05). The resolution of diabetes after bariatric surgery is associated
      with specific changes in the plasma proteomic profiles of proteins
      involved in acute-phase response, fibrinolysis, platelet degranulation,
      and blood coagulation, providing a pathophysiological basis for the study
      of their potential use as biomarkers of the surgical remission of T2D in a
      larger series of severely obese patients.

AB  - Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed upon nonenzymatic
      reactions of sugars or their metabolites with proteins and other cellular
      constituents. Many AGEs are long lived. Recent findings suggest that AGEs
      may predict diabetes and its complications and thus may warrant further
      study. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of our
      experimental procedures for measuring AGEs in stored blood sample and to
      conduct a pilot study for developing AGE biomarkers for diabetes and/or
      age-related changes of glucose metabolism. We conducted a reliability
      study of the samples and methods using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS assays for 10 AGEs (including
      methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone (MG-H1), glucosepane (GSP) and two
      oxidation measures, in stored repository blood samples from the Nurses'
      Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We also
      analyzed data relating blood GSP levels to type 2 diabetes status in a
      case-control study (25 cases and 15 controls). Among the AGEs, GSP, and
      MG-H1 showed the highest reliability across the various measures:
      reliability in duplicate samples and stability with delayed processing and
      storage over 1-2 year period. Furthermore, plasma GSP was associated with
      older age (P = 0.04) and type 2 diabetes status (age-adjusted P = 0.0475).
      Our findings suggest that analysis of these AGEs may be developed as
      biomarkers for diabetes and/or age-related changes of glucose metabolism.

AB  - Abnormal glucose handling has emerged as a major clinical problem in
      millions of diabetic patients worldwide. Insulin resistance affects
      especially one of the main target organs of this hormone, the skeletal
      musculature, making impaired glucose metabolism in contractile fibres a
      major feature of type 2 diabetes. High levels of circulating free fatty
      acids, an increased intramyocellular lipid content, impaired
      insulin-mediated glucose uptake, diminished mitochondrial functioning and
      an overall weakened metabolic flexibility are pathobiochemical hallmarks
      of diabetic skeletal muscles. In order to increase our cellular
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie this complex
      diabetes-associated skeletal muscle pathology, we initiated herein a mass
      spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of skeletal muscle preparations from
      the non-obese Goto-Kakizaki rat model of type 2 diabetes. Following
      staining of high-resolution two-dimensional gels with colloidal Coomassie
      Blue, 929 protein spots were detected, whereby 21 proteins showed a
      moderate differential expression pattern. Decreased proteins included
      carbonic anhydrase, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase and enolase.
      Increased proteins were identified as monoglyceride lipase, adenylate
      kinase, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, phosphoglucomutase, aldolase,
      isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase, small heat shock Hsp27/B1,
      actin and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. These proteomic findings
      suggest that the diabetic phenotype is associated with a generally
      perturbed protein expression pattern, affecting especially glucose, fatty
      acid, nucleotide and amino acid metabolism, as well as the contractile
      apparatus, the cellular stress response, the anti-oxidant defense system
      and detoxification mechanisms. The altered expression levels of distinct
      skeletal muscle proteins, as documented in this study, might be helpful
      for the future establishment of a comprehensive biomarker signature of
      type 2 diabetes. Reliable markers could be used for improving diagnostics,
      monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic evaluations.

AB  - AIM: To establish and compare serum proteomic of diabetic retinopathy (DR)
      patients in various phases and discuss pathogenesis of DR so as to find
      out possible serum specific molecular markers for early diagnosis of DR.
      METHODS: Thirty-two subjects were divided into four groups: one group of
      eight type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients without apparent DR (No-DR,
      NDR), one group of eight T2DM patients with non-proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy (NPDR), one group of eight T2DM patients with proliferative
      diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and one group of eight healthy volunteer
      participants. Two dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis
      (2D-DIGE) was applied to establish differential protein expression
      profiles in four groups. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time
      of flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS) was applied to
      identify mass spectrometry of differential proteins and analyze follow-up
      bioinformatics. RESULTS: 2D-DIGE maps of serum protein were satisfactory
      obtained from NDR, NPDR, PDR and normal control groups. Twenty-six
      different proteins spots were screened (the volume ratio was >1.5 based on
      DeCyder software analysis). Twenty-four of them were verified and two of
      them were not. Fifteen proteins were verified. Most of them were
      high-abundant proteins in serum. The four relatively low-abundant ones
      were beta 2-glycoprotein I (β(2)-GPI), alpha2-HS-glycoprotein(AHSG),
      alpha1-acid glycoprotein(α(1)-AGP) and apolipoprotein A-1(apo A-1).
      β(2)-GPI expression was gradually increased in the development of DR but
      unrelated to the severity of DR. The volume ratio of β(2)-GPI is 1.54,
      2.43, and 2.84 in NDR, NPDR and PDR group respectively compared with
      normal control group. CONCLUSION: Serum proteomic analysis of 2D-DIGE
      combined with MALDI-TOF-TOF MS is feasible to be applied in the study of
      DR. β(2)-GPI probably takes part in the process of DR occurrence and
      development and it could be a candidate biomarker on DR diagnosis in early
      phase.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy occurs in approximately 25% of patients with type 1
      or type 2 diabetes; the disease can cause poor vision and even blindness
      because high glucose levels weaken retinal capillaries, causing leakage of
      blood into surrounding areas. We adopted a proteomics-based approach using
      2D-DIGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS to compare the differential plasma proteome
      between diabetic retinopathy with significant retinopathy occurrence
      within 5years after diagnosis of diabetes, and diabetic non-retinopathy
      without diagnosed retinopathy for more than 10years after diagnosis of
      diabetes. We identified 77 plasma proteins, which represent 28 unique gene
      products. These proteins mainly have inflammatory response and coagulation
      roles. Our approach identified several potential diabetic retinopathy
      biomarkers including afamin and the protein arginine N-methyltransferase
      5, which may be associated with the progression and development of
      diabetes. In conclusion, we report a comprehensive patient-based plasma
      proteomic approach to the identification of potential plasma biomarkers
      for diabetic retinopathy screening and detection.

AB  - A common complication of both type I and type II diabetes is nephropathy,
      characterized by accumulation of extracellular matrix in the glomerular
      mesangium. This indicates a central role of mesangial cells in the
      pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy. Using the proteomic approach, it
      was earlier elucidated in a rat model that the proteasome subunit-α type-6
      protein (PSMA6) is suppressed in the renal cortex in nephropathic kidney.
      However, the underlying mechanism effecting suppression of PSMA6 protein
      in the renal cortex is not yet known. Twenty diabetic patients were
      enrolled and the expression level of PSMA6 in them was detected by
      immunohistochemistry. The protein and mRNA expression levels of PSMA6 in
      NRK-52E cells under high glucose condition were determined by Western blot
      and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. Dual luciferase assay was
      used to detect the relationship of PSMA6 and miR-4490. Our results show
      that PSMA6 protein is down-regulated in patients with diabetic nephropathy
      compared with healthy control. Using the NRK-52E cell line cultured under
      high glucose condition as an in vitro model of diabetic nephropathy, we
      show that loss of PSMA6 protein expression occured independent of changes
      the in PSMA6 mRNA expression. We next elucidate that PSMA6 mRNA is
      post-transcriptionally regulated by the microRNA (miRNA)-4490, whose
      expression is inversely correlated to PSMA6 protein expression. Using
      reporter assays we show that PSMA6 is a direct target of the miR-4490.
      Exogenous manipulation of miR-4490 levels modulated expression of PSMA6,
      indicating that miR-4490 can be tested as a biomarker for nephropathy in
      diabetic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few biomarkers of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are
      replicable in the differentiation of T2DM with different complications. We
      aimed to identify proteomic biomarkers among T2DM patients with
      nephropathy or retinopathy. METHODS: Plasma low abundance proteins were
      enriched by depletion of 14 high abundance proteins using an affinity
      removal system, and subjected to nanoflow liquid chromatography
      electrospray ionization (nano LC-ESI) mass spectrometry after a gel
      electrophoresis with in-gel digestion. The plasma differential proteomes
      between normal adults and diabetic patients were validated by another
      cohort of 149 T2DM patients. RESULTS: A total of 826 proteins in plasma
      were consistently identified from 8 plasma samples of normal adults, and
      817 proteins were consistently identified in 8 plasma samples of T2DM
      patients. Using the MetaCore analysis, low abundance proteins in plasma
      between normal adults and T2DM patients were significantly different in 5
      functional pathways. Moreover, plasma prolactin-induced protein (PIP),
      thrombospondin-2 (THBS2), L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) and neutrophil
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels were higher in T2DM
      patients. Further, PIP, THBS2 and NGAL were significantly higher in T2DM
      patients with nephropathy (albuminuria) but not in those with retinopathy,
      while L1CAM levels were higher in T2DM patients with retinopathy.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that higher PIP, THBS2 and/or NGAL
      levels were significantly associated with nephropathy of T2DM, and higher
      L1CAM but normal PIP, THBS2 or NGAL was significantly associated with
      retinopathy of T2DM.

AB  - PURPOSE: Objective markers of usual diet are of interest as alternative or
      validating tools in nutritional epidemiology research. The main purpose of
      the work was to assess whether saliva protein composition can reflect
      dietary habits in older adults, and how type 2 diabetes impacted on the
      saliva-diet correlates. METHODS: 214 participants were selected from 2
      European cohorts of community-dwelling older adults (3C-Bordeaux and
      Seniors-ENRICA-2), using a case-control design nested in each cohort.
      Cases were individuals with type 2 diabetes. Dietary information was
      obtained using the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). Saliva
      was successfully obtained from 211 subjects, and its proteome analyzed by
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The relative
      abundance of 246 saliva proteins was obtained across all participants. The
      salivary proteome differed depending on the intake level of some food
      groups (especially vegetables, fruits, sweet snacks and red meat), in a
      diabetic status- and cohort-specific manner. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
      suggested that some biological processes were consistently affected by
      diet across cohorts, for example enhanced platelet degranulation in high
      consumers of sweet snacks. Minimal models were then fitted to predict
      dietary variables by sociodemographic, clinical and salivary proteome
      variables. For the food group «sweet snacks», selected salivary proteins
      contributed to the predictive model and improved its performance in the

AB  - The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is growing exponentially in
      Western countries, and the incidence of this condition is today increasing
      worldwide. Other than for cardiovascular complications, diabetes is
      particularly challenging for the kidney's health and proper function.
      Prolonged exposure of the kidneys to hyperglycemia in fact often results
      in a clinical complication called diabetic glomerulosclerosis, also known
      as diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy represents today the leading
      cause of end-stage renal disease in Western countries. When left untreated
      or undiagnosed, diabetic nephropathy is ultimately responsible for the
      need for dialysis and, in the worst cases, kidney transplantation of the
      affected individuals. The pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy has been
      studied extensively. A great number of metabolites, cytokines, proteins
      and transcription factors play a role in the accumulation of extracellular
      matrix and mesangial proliferation in the glomerulus; importantly, these
      phenotypic alterations are considered the 2 histological hallmarks of
      diabetic nephropathy. Additional effort is however required to understand
      the wide network of biochemical pathways that link diabetes to the renal
      damage in the long run. The integrative analysis of the proteomic and
      transcriptomic features of body fluids and/or bioptic samples among
      different categories of patients affected by diabetic nephropathy, if
      based on the accurate classification of the histopathological changes in
      the glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartment, could lead to the
      identification of new early biomarkers. This approach could represent an
      effective, noninvasive, alternative tool for early diagnosis and
      intervention.

AB  - Metabolic disorders in T2DM generate multiple sources of free radicals and
      oxidative stress that accelerate nonenzymatic degenerative protein
      modifications (DPMs) such as protein oxidation, disrupt redox signaling
      and physiological function, and remain a major risk factor for clinical
      diabetic vascular complications. In order to identify potential oxidative
      biomarkers in the blood plasma of patients with T2DM, we used
      LC-MS/MS-based proteomics to profile plasma samples from patients with
      T2DM and healthy controls. The results showed that human serum albumin
      (HSA) is damaged by irreversible cysteine trioxidation, which can be a
      potential oxidative stress biomarker for the early diagnosis of T2DM. The
      quantitative detection of site-specific thiol trioxidation is technically
      challenging; thus, we developed a sensitive and selective LC-MS/MS
      workflow that has been used to discover and quantify three unique
      thiol-trioxidized HSA peptides, ALVLIAFAQYLQQC(SO3H)PFEDHVK (m/z 1241.13),
      YIC(SO3H)ENQDSISSK (m/z 717.80) and RPC(SO3H)FSALEVDETYVPK (m/z 951.45),
      in 16 individual samples of healthy controls (n = 8) and individuals with
      diabetes (n = 8). Targeted quantitative analysis using multiple reaction
      monitoring mass spectrometry revealed impairment of the peptides with m/z
      1241.13, m/z 717.80 and m/z 951.45, with significance (P < 0.02, P < 0.002
      and P < 0.03), in individuals with diabetes. The results demonstrated that
      a set of three HSA thiol-trioxidized peptides, which are irreversibly
      oxidatively damaged in HSA in the plasma of patients with T2DM, can be
      important indicators and potential biomarkers of oxidative stress in T2DM.

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a peptidomic profile based on
      LC-MS/MS and random forest (RF) algorithm to distinguish the urinary
      peptidomic scenario of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with
      different stages of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Urine from 60 T2DM
      patients was collected: 22 normal (stage A1), 18 moderately increased
      (stage A2) and 20 severely increased (stage A3) albuminuria. A total of
      1080 naturally occurring peptides were detected, which resulted in the
      identification of a total of 100 proteins, irrespective of the patients'
      renal status. The classification accuracy showed that the most severe DKD
      (A3) presented a distinct urinary peptidomic pattern. Estimates for
      peptide importance assessed during RF model training included multiple
      fragments of collagen and alpha-1 antitrypsin, previously associated to
      DKD. Proteasix tool predicted 48 proteases potentially involved in the
      generation of the 60 most important peptides identified in the urine of DM
      patients, including metallopeptidases, cathepsins, and calpains.
      Collectively, our study lightened some biomarkers possibly involved in the
      pathogenic mechanisms of DKD, suggesting that peptidomics is a valuable
      tool for identifying the molecular mechanisms underpinning the disease and
      thus novel therapeutic targets.

AB  - Bariatric surgery (BS) results in metabolic pathway recalibration. We have
      identified potential biomarkers in plasma of people achieving type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remission after BS. Longitudinal analysis was
      performed on plasma from 10 individuals following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
      (n = 7) or sleeve gastrectomy (n = 3). Sequential window acquisition of
      all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) was done
      on samples taken at 4 months before (baseline) and 6 and 12 months after
      BS. Four hundred sixty-seven proteins were quantified by SWATH-MS.
      Principal component analysis resolved samples from distinct time points
      after selection of key discriminatory proteins: 25 proteins were
      differentially expressed between baseline and 6 months post-surgery; 39
      proteins between baseline and 12 months. Eight proteins (SHBG, TF, PRG4,
      APOA4, LRG1, HSPA4, EPHX2 and PGLYRP) were significantly different to
      baseline at both 6 and 12 months post-surgery. The panel of proteins
      identified as consistently different included peptides related to insulin
      sensitivity (SHBG increase), systemic inflammation (TF and HSPA4-both
      decreased) and lipid metabolism (APOA4 decreased). We found significant
      changes in the proteome for eight proteins at 6- and 12-months post-BS,
      and several of these are key components in metabolic and inflammatory
      pathways. These may represent potential biomarkers of remission of T2DM.

AB  - The identification of biomarkers to noninvasively detect
      prediabetes/diabetes will facilitate interventions designed to prevent or
      delay progression to frank diabetes and its attendant complications. The
      purpose of this study was to characterize the human salivary proteome in
      type-2 diabetes to identify potential biomarkers of diabetes. Whole saliva
      from control and type-2 diabetic individuals was characterized by
      multidimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry
      (2D-LC-MS/MS). Label-free quantification was used to identify
      differentially abundant protein biomarkers. Selected potential biomarkers
      were then independently validated in saliva from control, diabetic, and
      prediabetic subjects by Western immunoblotting and ELISA. Characterization
      of the salivary proteome identified a total of 487 unique proteins.
      Approximately 33% of these have not been previously reported in human
      saliva. Of these, 65 demonstrated a greater than 2-fold difference in
      abundance between control and type-2 diabetes samples. A majority of the
      differentially abundant proteins belong to pathways regulating metabolism
      and immune response. Independent validation of a subset of potential
      biomarkers utilizing immunodetection confirmed their differential
      expression in type-2 diabetes, and analysis of prediabetic samples
      demonstrated a trend of relative increase in their abundance with
      progression from the prediabetic to the diabetic state. This comprehensive
      proteomic analysis of the human salivary proteome in type-2 diabetes
      provides the first global view of potential mechanisms perturbed in
      diabetic saliva and their utility in detection and monitoring of diabetes.
      Further characterization of these markers in a larger cohort of subjects
      may provide the basis for new, noninvasive tests for diabetes screening,
      detection, and monitoring.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to identify proteins that
      contribute to pathophysiology and allow prediction of incident type 2
      diabetes or incident prediabetes. We quantified 14 candidate proteins
      using targeted mass spectrometry in plasma samples of the prospective,
      population-based German KORA F4/FF4 study (6.5-year follow-up). 892
      participants aged 42-81 years were selected using a case-cohort design,
      including 123 persons with incident type 2 diabetes and 255 persons with
      incident WHO-defined prediabetes. Prospective associations between protein
      levels and diabetes, prediabetes as well as continuous fasting and 2 h
      glucose, fasting insulin and insulin resistance were investigated using
      regression models adjusted for established risk factors. The best
      predictive panel of proteins on top of a non-invasive risk factor model or
      on top of HbA1c, age, and sex was selected. Mannan-binding lectin serine
      peptidase (MASP) levels were positively associated with both incident type
      2 diabetes and prediabetes. Adiponectin was inversely associated with
      incident type 2 diabetes. MASP, adiponectin, apolipoprotein A-IV,
      apolipoprotein C-II, C-reactive protein, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol
      specific phospholipase D1 were associated with individual continuous
      outcomes. The combination of MASP, apolipoprotein E (apoE) and adiponectin
      improved diabetes prediction on top of both reference models, while
      prediabetes prediction was improved by MASP plus CRP on top of the HbA1c
      model. In conclusion, our mass spectrometric approach revealed a novel
      association of MASP with incident type 2 diabetes and incident
      prediabetes. In combination, MASP, adiponectin and apoE improved type 2
      diabetes prediction beyond non-invasive risk factors or HbA1c, age and
      sex.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As part of a clinical proteomics program focused on diabetes
      and its complications we are looking for new and better protein biomarkers
      for diabetic nephropathy. The search for new and better biomarkers for
      diabetic nephropathy has, with a few exceptions, previously focused on
      either hypothesis-driven studies or urinary based investigations. To date
      only two studies have investigated the proteome of blood in search for new
      biomarkers, and these studies were conducted in sera from patients with
      type 2 diabetes. This is the first reported in depth proteomic study where
      plasma from type 1 diabetic patients was investigated with the goal of
      finding improved candidate biomarkers to predict diabetic nephropathy. In
      order to reach lower concentration proteins in plasma a pre-fractionation
      step, either hexapeptide bead-based libraries or anion exchange
      chromatography, was performed prior to surface enhanced laser
      desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. RESULTS:
      Proteomic analysis of plasma from a cross-sectional cohort of 123 type 1
      diabetic patients previously diagnosed as normoalbuminuric,
      microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric, gave rise to 290 peaks clusters of
      which 16 were selected as the most promising biomarker candidates based on
      statistical performance, including independent component analysis. Four of
      the peaks that were discovered have been identified as transthyretin,
      apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein C1 and cystatin C. Several yet
      unidentified proteins discovered by this novel approach appear to have
      more potential as biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy. CONCLUSION: These
      results demonstrate the capacity of proteomic analysis of plasma, by
      confirming the presence of known biomarkers as well as revealing new
      biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy in plasma in type 1 diabetic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the proteomic era, one of the most rapidly growing
      areas in biomedical research is biomarker discovery, particularly using
      proteomic technologies. The urinary proteome is known to be a valuable
      field of study and has become one of the most attractive subdisciplines in
      clinical proteomics for human diseases. We have described the levels of
      protein biomarkers specific to diabetes mellitus type 2 in the Pakistani
      population using proteomic technology. METHODS: One hundred type 2
      diabetes patients with 50 age- and sex-matched normal healthy controls
      were recruited from Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Urinary
      proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional liquid chromatography, using
      chromatofocusing in the first dimension and reverse-phase chromatography
      in the second, followed by mass spectrometric analysis. Levels of the
      proteins, which were found to vary in the diabetes type 2 patients
      compared to the controls, were then determined by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay in all the samples. RESULTS: Levels of transthyretin,
      α-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor, and haptoglobin precursor decreased
      by 30.8%, 55.2%, and 81.45%, whereas levels of albumin, zinc α2
      glycoprotein, retinol binding protein 4, and E-cadherin increased by
      486.5%, 29.23%, 100%, and 693%, respectively, in the diabetes patients
      compared to the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in the levels of these
      identified protein biomarkers have been reported in other pathological
      states. Assessment of the levels of these biomarkers will be helpful not
      only in early diagnosis but also in prognosis of diabetes mellitus type 2.

AB  - Discovery of protein biomarkers in different diseases is an important area
      of research in the field of proteomics. We have described the levels of
      protein biomarkers specific to diabetes mellitus type 2 in the local
      population of Pakistan using proteomic technology. Type 2 diabetic
      patients, age and sex-matched normal healthy controls were recruited from
      Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Plasma proteins were analysed by
      2D liquid chromatographic system in which samples were initially
      fractionated by chromatofocusing and the selected fractions were further
      analysed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The
      proteins which showed variation between test and control samples were
      identified by MALDI-TOF analysis. All the samples belonging to the control
      and diabetic groups were then analyzed by ELISA and estimated four
      proteins which were found to vary. Levels of apolipoprotein A-I was found
      to decrease by -6.4% while apolipoprotein E, leptin and C reactive protein
      (CRP) were increased by +802, +842 and +872%, respectively, in the
      diabetic patients as compared to the controls. The discovery of these
      marker proteins might thus provide an adjunctive method for early
      detection of risk for this disease.

AB  - Early detection of insulin resistance (IR) and/or impaired glucose
      tolerance (IGT) is crucial for delaying and preventing the progression
      toward type 2 diabetes. We recently developed and validated a
      straightforward metabolite-based test for the assessment of IR and IGT in
      a single LC-MS/MS method. Plasma samples were diluted with
      isotopically-labeled internal standards and extracted by simple protein
      precipitation. The extracts were analyzed by LC-MS/MS for the quantitation
      of 2-hydroxybutyric acid (0.500-40.0μg/mL), 3-hydroxybutyric acid
      (1.00-80.0μg/mL), 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid (0.500-20.0μg/mL),
      1-linoleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (2.50-100μg/mL), oleic
      acid (10.0-400μg/mL), pantothenic acid (0.0100-0.800μg/mL), and serine
      (2.50-100μg/mL). Liquid chromatography was carried out on a reversed phase
      column with a run time of 3.1min and the mass spectrometer operated in
      negative MRM mode. Method validation was performed on three identical
      LC-MS/MS systems with five runs each. Sufficient linearity (R2>0.99) was
      observed for all the analytes over the ranges. The imprecision (CVs) was
      found to be less than 5.5% for intra-run and less than 5.8% for inter-run
      for the seven analytes. The analytical recovery was determined to be
      between 96.3 and 103% for the seven analytes. This fast and robust method
      has subsequently been used for patient sample analysis for the assessment
      of IR and IGT.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic renal insufficiency and/or proteinuria in type 2
      diabetes may stem from chronic renal diseases (CKD) other than classic
      diabetic nephropathy in more than one-third of patients. We interrogated
      urine proteomic profiles generated by surface-enhanced laser
      desorption/ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry with the aim of
      isolating a set of biomarkers able to reliably identify biopsy-proven
      diabetic nephropathy and to establish a stringent correlation with the
      different patterns of renal injury. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten
      micrograms of urine proteins from 190 subjects (20 healthy subjects, 20
      normoalbuminuric, and 18 microalbuminuric diabetic patients and 132
      patients with biopsy-proven nephropathy: 65 diabetic nephropathy, 10
      diabetic with nondiabetic CKD [nd-CKD], and 57 nondiabetic with CKD) were
      run using a CM10 ProteinChip array and analyzed by supervised learning
      methods (Classification and Regression Tree analysis). RESULTS: The
      classification model correctly identified 75% of patients with
      normoalbuminuria, 87.5% of those with microalbuminuria, and 87.5% of those
      with diabetic nephropathy when applied to a blinded testing set. Most
      importantly, it was able to reliably differentiate diabetic nephropathy
      from nd-CKD in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Among the best
      predictors of the classification model, we identified and validated two
      proteins, ubiquitin and β2-microglobulin. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest
      the presence of a specific urine proteomic signature able to reliably
      identify type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic glomerulosclerosis.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes and tooth loss are linked both epidemiologically and
      pathophysiologically. We applied label-free differential protein
      expression analysis using multidimensional liquid chromatography/tandem
      mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) to explore the proteomic profile of saliva
      samples collected from selected type 2 diabetic edentulous patients and
      non-diabetic controls. Ninety-six peptides corresponding to 52 proteins
      were differentially expressed between the diabetic edentulous patients and
      controls (p < 0.05). Some diabetes-related inflammatory biomarkers
      including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and serum amyloid A
      were detected with levels increased in diabetic samples. Other biomarkers
      including amylase, palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated protein
      (PLUNC), and serotransferrin levels were decreased in diabetic samples. In
      contrast with previous findings, salivary carbonic anhydrase 6 and alpha-2
      macroglobulin levels, however, were decreased in this diabetic patient
      population. Cluster analysis and principle component analysis demonstrated
      a differential pattern of protein biomarker expression between diabetic
      and control subjects. Western blot analysis was completed to confirm the
      relatively lower expression level of two biomarkers, including PLUNC and
      amylase in the diabetic group compared to control subjects. The presence
      of salivary biomarkers specific for diabetes in edentulous subjects mimics
      those in serum, especially those related to inflammatory/lipid metabolism.
      While this exploratory study requires further validation with a larger
      population, it provides proof-of-principle for salivary proteomics for
      edentulous subjects with diabetes.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that the accumulation of atypical,
      1-deoxysphingolipids that lack the C1 hydroxyl group may be associated
      with diabetic neuropathy (DN). We hypothesized that specific plasma
      1-deoxysphingolipids associate with DN severity, and that alterations in
      plasma serine and alanine associate with 1-deoxysphingolipid elevation in
      patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We examined individual
      1-deoxysphingolipid species using LC/MS/MS in plasma samples from 75
      individuals including lean controls (LC, n = 19), those with obesity (n =
      19), obesity with T2D without DN (ob/T2D, n = 18), and obesity with T2D
      with DN (Ob/T2D/DN, n = 19). We observed a step wise increase in
      1-deoxydihydroceramides across these four groups (spearman correlation
      coefficient r = 0.41, p = 0.0002). Mean total concentrations of
      1-deoxydihydroceramides, and most individual 1-deoxydihydroceramide
      species, were higher in ob/T2D/DN versus LC group (8.939 vs. 5.195
      pmol/100 μL for total 1-deoxydihydroceramides p = 0.005). No significant
      differences in 1-deoxydihydroceramides were observed between the ob/T2D
      and ob/T2D/DN groups. l-alanine was higher and l-serine lower in ob/T2D/DN
      versus LC groups (326.2 vs. 248.0 μM, p = 0.0086 and 70.2 vs. 89.8 μM, p =
      0.0110), consistent with a potential contribution of these changes to the
      observed 1-deoxysphingolipids profiles. 1-deoxydihydroceramides correlated
      inversely with leg intraepidermal nerve fiber density (CC -0.40, p =
      0.003). These findings indicate that 1-deoxydihydroceramides may be
      important biomarkers and/or mediators of DN.

AB  - The incidence of diabetes mellitus is growing rapidly, with an increasing
      disease related morbidity and mortality. This is caused by macro- and
      microvascular complications, as a consequence of the often late diagnosis
      of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but especially by the difficulties to control
      glucose homeostasis due to the progressive nature of the disease. T2D is
      moreover a dual disease, with components of beta-cell failure and
      components of insulin resistance in peripheral organs, such as liver, fat,
      and muscle. Understanding the pathogenesis of the disease by gaining
      insight into the molecular pathways involved in both phenomena is one of
      the major assets of proteomic approaches. Moreover, proteomics and
      peptidomics may provide us with robust biomarkers for beta-cell failure,
      insulin resistance in pheripheral organs, but also for the development of
      diabetic complications. This review focuses on the knowledge gained by use
      of proteomic and peptidomic techniques in the study of the pathophysiology
      of T2D and in the attempts to discover new therapeutic targets.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus in general and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) in particular, are
      very complex diseases with heterogeneous etiology. T2D results from the
      impaired secretion or action of the insulin with a clinical phenotype of
      persistent hyperglycemia in the uncontrolled subjects. The disease
      clinical features appear after several years of latent preclinical
      asymptomatic conditions. Thus, when the disease is full blown, there are
      limited chances to reverse the disease phenotype; however, it can be
      managed by controlling diet, changing life style and using medicines.
      Understanding pathological mechanisms whereby genetic and/or environmental
      factors contribute to the development of diabetes is important for the
      prevention and treatment of the disease. In this regard, approaches such
      as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics are being
      applied to identify more specific biomarkers for T2D for its early
      detection, management and devising new therapies. The emphasis of the
      present review is to provide updates on the applications of proteomics in
      addressing T2D with a focus on protein based biomarker discovery.
      Moreover, the idea of personalized medicine and intervention is also
      discussed for diabetes treatment in proteomics perspective.

AB  - The general awareness of the importance of peptides in physiology and
      pathophysiology has increased strongly over the last few years. With
      worldwide progress in the analysis of whole genomes, the knowledge base in
      gene sequence and expression data useful for protein and peptide analysis
      has drastically increased. The medical need for relevant biomarkers is
      enormous. This is particularly true for the many types of cancer, but
      other diseases such as Type 2 diabetes also lack useful and adequate
      diagnostic markers with high specificity and sensitivity. Despite advances
      in imaging technologies for early detection of diseases, proteomic and
      peptidomic multiplex techniques have evolved in recent years. This review
      focuses on the application of peptidomics technologies to peptides in
      health and disease. Peptidomics technologies provide new opportunities for
      the detection of low-molecular-weight proteome biomarkers (peptides) by
      mass spectrometry. Improvements in peptidomics research are based on
      separation of peptides and/or proteins by their physicochemical properties
      in combination with mass spectrometric detection, identification and
      sophisticated bioinformatics tools for data analysis. Therefore,
      peptidomics technologies offer an opportunity to discover novel biomarkers
      for diagnosis and management of disease (e.g., prognosis, treatment
      decision and monitoring response to therapy).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The hepatokine fetuin-A, released by the human liver, promotes
      pro-inflammatory effects of perivascular fat. The involvement of
      inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can affect the kidney and
      contribute to the development of diabetic kidney disease. Therefore we
      examined the association of urinary fetuin-A protein fragments with renal
      damage in T2DM patients. METHODS: Urinary peptides of 1491 individuals
      using proteome data available from the human urine proteome database were
      analysed. Prediction of proteases involved in urinary peptide generation
      was performed using the Proteasix tool. RESULTS: We identified 14
      different urinary protein fragments that belong to the region of the
      connecting peptide (amino acid 301-339) of the total fetuin-A protein.
      Calpains (CAPN1 and CAPN2), matrix metalloproteinase and pepsin A-3 were
      identified as potential proteases that were partially confirmed by
      previous in vitro studies. Combined fetuin-A peptides (mean of amplitudes)
      were significantly increased in T2DM patients with kidney disease and to a
      lesser extent with cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, fetuin-A peptide
      levels displayed a significant negative correlation with baseline
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values (r = -0.316, P <
      0.0001) and with the slope (%) of eGFR per year (r = -0.096, P = 0.023). A
      multiple regression model including fetuin-A peptide and albuminuria
      resulted in a significantly improved correlation with eGFR (r = -0.354, P
      < 0.0001) compared with albuminuria, indicating an added value of this
      novel biomarker. CONCLUSIONS: The urinary proteome analysis demonstrated
      the association of fetuin-A peptides with impaired kidney function in T2DM
      patients. Furthermore, fetuin-A peptides displayed early signs of kidney
      damage before albuminuria appeared and therefore can be used as markers
      for kidney disease detection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex, pandemic disease
      contributing towards the global burden of health issues. To date, there
      are no simple clinical tests for the early detection of T2DM. METHOD: To
      identify potential peptide biomarkers for such applications, 406 sera of
      T2DM patients (n = 206) and healthy controls (n = 200) are analyzed by
      using MALDI-TOF MS with a cross-sectional case-control design. RESULT: Six
      peptides (peaks m/z 1452.9, 1692.8, 1946.0, 2115.1, 2211.0 and 4053.6) are
      identified as candidate biomarkers for T2DM. A diagnostic model
      constructed with six peptides is able to discriminate T2DM patients from
      healthy controls, with an accuracy of 82.20%, sensitivity of 82.50%, and
      specificity of 77.80% in the validation set. Peptide peaks m/z 1452.9 and
      1692.8 are identified as fragments of the complement C3f, while peptide
      peaks m/z 1946.0, 2115.1, and 2211.0 are identified as the fragments of
      kininogen 1 isoform 1 precursor. CONCLUSION: This study reinforces
      proteomic analyses as a potential technique for defining significant
      clinical peptide biomarkers, providing a simple and convenient diagnostic
      model for T2DM in clinical examination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes who had a recent myocardial infarction
      (MI) are at high risk of cardiovascular events. Therefore, risk assessment
      is important for treatment and shared decisions. We used data from EXAMINE
      trial to investigate whether a multi-proteomic approach would provide
      specific proteomic signatures and also improve the prognostic capacity for
      determining the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, heart failure
      [HF], all-cause death, and combinations of these outcomes. METHODS: 93
      circulating proteins (92 from the Olink® CVDII plus troponin) were
      assessed in 5131 patients. Cox, competing risks, and reclassification
      measures were applied. RESULTS: The clinical model showed good
      discrimination and calibration for all outcomes. On top of the clinical
      model that included age, sex, smoking, diabetes duration, history of MI
      (prior to the index MI of inclusion), history of HF hospitalization,
      history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, systolic blood
      pressure, statin therapy, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and study
      treatment (alogliptin or placebo), troponin and BNP added prognostic
      information to the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke
      (∆C-index + 5%) and cardiovascular death alone (∆C-index + 7%). Troponin,
      BNP, and TRAILR2 added prognostic information on all-cause death and the
      composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization. HF
      hospitalization alone was improved by adding BNP and Gal-9. For MI,
      troponin, FGF23, and AMBP added prognostic value; whereas for stroke, only
      troponin added prognostic value (multi-proteomics improved C-index > 3% [p
      < 0.001] for all the studied outcomes). The addition of the final
      biomarker selection to the clinical model improved event reclassification
      (cNRI from + 23% to + 64%). Specifically, the addition of the biomarkers
      allowed a better classification of patients at low risk (as having "true"
      low risk) and patients and high risk (as having "true" high risk). These
      results were consistent for all the studied outcomes with even more marked
      differences in the fatal events. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of
      multi-proteomic biomarkers to a clinical model in this population with
      diabetes and a recent MI allowed a better risk prediction and event
      reclassification, potentially helping for better risk assessment and
      targeted treatment decisions. T2D type 2 diabetes, MI myocardial

AB  - Thrombus formation underpins the development of cardiovascular diseases,
      including acute coronary syndromes and ischaemic stroke. A number of
      well-characterised cardiovascular risk factors which contribute to the
      development of the majority of cardiovascular events have been identified,
      including dyslipidaemia, hypertension and diabetes. Individuals with type
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a 3- to 5-fold increased risk for
      development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). They may have a cluster of
      haemostatic abnormalities, including elevated levels of plasminogen
      activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and fibrinogen, which contribute to acute
      thrombotic events. It is clear that additional unidentified risk factors
      contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular events, and so the search
      for novel biomarkers and effectors, particularly in individuals with T2DM,
      remains a major challenge of cardiovascular medicine. Plasma and cellular
      proteins which contribute to thrombus formation have the potential to
      confer a pro-thrombotic state and represent a link between genotype,
      environment and disease phenotype. The comprehensive analysis of these
      proteins is now increasingly facilitated through the continued development
      of proteomic technologies which provide multifaceted approaches to the
      identification of novel biomarkers and/or effectors of thrombus formation
      and on which future anticoagulant and thrombolytic therapies may be based.
      This review provides an overview of current proteomic technologies. It
      focuses on the recent studies in which these technologies have been
      applied in the search for novel proteins that may confer increased risk of
      acute cardiovascular diseases and therefore that may influence disease
      progression and therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an
      increased risk of suffering from various malignancies. This study aimed to
      identify specific biomarkers that can detect lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) in
      T2DM patients for the early diagnosis of LAC. METHODS: The clinical
      information of hospitalized T2DM patients diagnosed with various cancers
      was collected by reviewing medical records in Wuxi People's Hospital
      Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University from January 1, 2015, to June 30,
      2020. To discover diagnostic biomarkers for early-stage LAC in the T2DM
      population, 20 samples obtained from 5 healthy controls, 5 T2DM patients,
      5 LAC patients and 5 T2DM patients with LAC (T2DM + LAC) were subjected to
      sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass
      spectrum (SWATH-MS) analysis to identify specific differentially-expressed
      proteins (DEPs) for LAC in patients with T2DM. Then, these results were
      validated by parallel reaction monitoring MS (PRM-MS) and ELISA analyses.
      RESULTS: Lung cancer was the most common malignant tumor in patients with
      T2DM, and LAC accounted for the majority of cases. Using SWATH-MS
      analysis, we found 13 proteins to be unique in T2DM patients with early
      LAC. Two serum proteins were further validated by PRM-MS analysis, namely,
      pregnancy-zone protein (PZP) and insulin-like growth factor binding
      protein 3 (IGFBP3). Furthermore, the diagnostic values of these proteins
      were validated by ELISA, and PZP was validated as a novel serum biomarker
      for screening LAC in T2DM patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated
      that PZP could be used as a novel serum biomarker for the identification
      of LAC in T2DM patients, which will enhance auxiliary diagnosis and assist
      in the selection of surgical treatment at an early stage.

AB  - Regulation of blood glucose requires precise coordination between
      different endocrine systems and multiple organs. Type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2D) arises from a dysregulated response to elevated glucose levels in
      the circulation. Globally, the prevalence of T2D has increased
      dramatically in all age groups. T2D in older adults is associated with
      higher mortality and reduced functional status, leading to higher rate of
      institutionalization. Despite the potential healthcare challenges
      associated with the presence of T2D in the elderly, the pathogenesis and
      phenotype of late-onset T2D is not well studied. Here we applied
      untargeted metabolite profiling of urine samples from people with and
      without late-onset T2D using ultra-performance liquid-chromatography
      mass-spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to identify urinary biomarkers for late-onset
      T2D in the elderly. Statistical modeling of measurements and thorough
      validation of structural assignment using liquid chromatography tandem
      mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) have led to the identification of metabolite
      biomarkers associated with late-onset T2D. Lower levels of phenylalanine,
      acetylhistidine, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were found in
      urine samples of T2D subjects validated with commercial standards.
      Elevated levels of 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), which previously has only
      been implicated in animal model of diabetes, was found in urine of older
      people with T2D.

AB  - AIM: The Xiaoke Pill containing Chinese herb extracts and Glibenclamide,
      is used in therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and is effective
      in reducing the risk of hypoglycemia and improving diabetes symptoms
      compared with Glibenclamide. We describe a quantitative proteomics project
      to measure the T2DM serum proteome response to the Xiaoke Pill and
      Glibenclamide. METHODS: Based on a recently conducted 48-week clinical
      trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Glibenclamide (n = 400) and
      Xiaoke Pill (n = 400), after matching for age, sex, BMI, drug dose and
      whether hypoglycemia occurred, 32 patients were selected for the serum
      based proteomic analysis and divided into four groups (with/without
      hypoglycemia treated with Xiaoke Pill or Glibenclamide, n = 8 for each
      group). We screened the differential serum proteins related to treatments
      and the onset of hypoglycemia using the iTRAQ labeling quantitative
      proteomics technique. Baseline and follow-up samples were used. RESULTS:
      The quantitative proteomics experiments demonstrated that 25 and 21
      proteins differed upon treatment with the Xiaoke Pill in patients without
      and with hypoglycemia, respectively, while 24 and 25 proteins differed
      upon treatment with Glibenclamide in patients without and with
      hypoglycemia, respectively. The overlap of different proteins between the
      patients with and without hypoglycemia given the same drug treatment was
      much greater than between the patients given different drug treatments.
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the serum proteins response to the two
      different anti-diabetic drug treatments may serve as a sensitive biomarker
      for evaluation of the therapeutic effects and continue investigations into
      the mechanism.

AB  - Background: Growing evidence has confirmed that populations with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increasing risk of developing colorectal
      cancer (CRC). Thus, convenient and effective screening strategies for CRC
      should be developed for the T2DM population to increase the detection rate
      of CRC. Methods: Twenty serum samples extracted from five healthy
      participants, five T2DM patients, five CRC patients and five T2DM patients
      with CRC (T2DM + CRC) were submitted to data-independent acquisition mass
      spectrometry (DIA-MS) analysis to discover unique differentially altered
      proteins (DAPs) for CRC in patients with T2DM. Then, the diagnostic value
      of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) was validated by ELISA analysis in the
      validated cohort. Results: Based on DIA-MS analysis, we found eight unique
      proteins specific to T2DM patients with CRC. Among these proteins, four
      proteins showed different expression between the T2DM + CRC and T2DM
      groups, and PZP exhibited the largest difference. Next, the diagnostic
      value of serum PZP was validated by ELISA analysis with an AUC of 0.713.
      Moreover, the combination of PZP, CA199 and CEA exhibited encouraging
      diagnostic value, and the AUC reached 0.916. Conclusion: Overall, our
      current research implied that PZP could be regarded as a newfound serum
      biomarker for CRC medical diagnosis in T2DM patients.

AB  - Abdominal or visceral obesity is a well-known risk factor for metabolic
      diseases. However, whether abdominal obesity significantly affects plasma
      lipid profile during the development of type 2 diabetes has not been fully
      elucidated. We investigated the differences in plasma lipid concentrations
      in 63 participants categorized into six groups (middle-aged Korean men);
      Normal, Pre-diabetes (pre-DM), and Diabetes mellitus (DM) with or without
      abdominal obesity (AO or lean). The lipidomic profiles were determined by
      using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
      Sphingomyelin (SM) levels in plasma were significantly higher in the
      pre-DM with AO than in pre-DM with lean (p = 0.021). SM concentrations
      correlated positively with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (r = 0.256, p =
      0.044), cholesteryl ester (CE) (r = 0.483, p < 0.0001), ceramide (r =
      0.489, p < 0.0001) and plasmanyl phosphatidylcholine (PC) (r = 0.446, p <
      0.0001). The present study found that pre-diabetic patients with AO were
      characterized by increased plasma concentrations of SM. Plasma SM levels
      in individuals with AO may be an early prognostic biomarker to better
      predict the progression toward type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

AB  - AIMS: To determine whether biomarkers for diabetic kidney disease (DKD)
      can be used to determine the prevalence, progression and/or incidence of
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) complicating type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Proteomic
      biomarkers were measured in baseline fasting plasma from 958 Fremantle
      Diabetes Study Phase II participants whose baseline and, in those
      returning for follow-up (n = 764), Year 4 fundus photographs were graded
      for DR presence/severity. The performance of PromarkerD (three biomarkers
      and readily available clinical variables which identify prevalent DKD and
      predict incident DKD and estimated glomerular filtration rate decline ≥30%
      over four years) for detecting DR prevalence, progression and incidence
      was assessed using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).
      Logistic regression determined whether individual proteins were associated
      with DR outcomes after adjusting for the most parsimonious model. RESULTS:
      Plasma apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4) was independently associated with
      moderate non-proliferative DR at baseline (OR (95% CI): 1.64 (1.01, 2.67),
      P = 0.047). Model discrimination was poor for all PromarkerD predicted
      probabilities against all DR outcomes (AUC ≤0.681). CONCLUSIONS:
      PromarkerD and its constituent biomarkers were not consistently associated
      with DR prevalence or temporal change. APOA4 was associated with prevalent
      DR, but not DR incidence or progression. Distinct pathophysiological
      mechanisms may underlie DKD and DR.

AB  - HIV and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are both associated with gut microbiota
      alterations, low-grade endotoxemia and increased cardiovascular risk. We
      investigated the potential role of plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) in
      relation to these processes. Plasma EVs were isolated by size exclusion
      chromatography in fasting individuals with HIV and T2D (n = 16), T2D only
      (n = 14), HIV only (n = 20) or healthy controls (n = 19), and
      characterized by transmission electron microscopy, western blot,
      nanoparticle tracking analysis and quantitative proteomics. The findings
      were compared to gut microbiota alterations, lipopolysaccharide levels and
      cardiovascular risk profile. Individuals with concomitant HIV and T2D had
      higher plasma EV concentration, which correlated closely with plasma
      lipopolysaccharides, triglycerides and Framingham score, but not with gut
      microbiota alterations. Proteomic analyses identified 558 human proteins,
      largely related to cardiometabolic disease genes and upstream regulation
      of inflammatory pathways, including IL-6 and IL-1β, as well as 30
      bacterial proteins, mostly from lipopolysaccharide-producing
      Proteobacteria. Our study supports that EVs are related to microbial
      translocation processes in individuals with HIV and T2D. Their proteomic
      content suggests a contributing role in low-grade inflammation and
      cardiovascular risk development. The present approach for exploring
      gut-host crosstalk can potentially identify novel diagnostic biomarkers
      and therapeutic targets.

AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Increased levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)
      are associated with type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. However, most
      metabolomic studies are limited to an analysis of plasma metabolites under
      fasting conditions, rather than the dynamic shift in response to a
      metabolic challenge. Moreover, metabolomic profiles of peripheral tissues
      involved in glucose homeostasis are scarce and the transcriptomic
      regulation of genes involved in BCAA catabolism is partially unknown. This
      study aimed to identify differences in circulating and skeletal muscle
      BCAA levels in response to an OGTT in individuals with normal glucose
      tolerance (NGT) or type 2 diabetes. Additionally, transcription factors
      involved in the regulation of the BCAA gene set were identified. METHODS:
      Plasma and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained from individuals
      with NGT or type 2 diabetes before and after an OGTT. Plasma and
      quadriceps muscles were harvested from skeletal muscle-specific Ppargc1a
      knockout and transgenic mice. BCAA-related metabolites and genes were
      assessed by LC-MS/MS and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Small
      interfering RNA and adenovirus-mediated overexpression techniques were
      used in primary human skeletal muscle cells to study the role of PPARGC1A
      and ESRRA in the expression of the BCAA gene set. Radiolabelled leucine
      was used to analyse the impact of oestrogen-related receptor α (ERRα)
      knockdown on leucine oxidation. RESULTS: Impairments in BCAA catabolism in
      people with type 2 diabetes under fasting conditions were exacerbated
      after a glucose load. Branched-chain keto acids were reduced 37-56% after
      an OGTT in the NGT group, whereas no changes were detected in individuals
      with type 2 diabetes. These changes were concomitant with a stronger
      correlation with glucose homeostasis biomarkers and downregulated
      expression of branched-chain amino acid transaminase 2, branched-chain
      keto acid dehydrogenase complex subunits and 69% of downstream
      BCAA-related genes in skeletal muscle. In primary human myotubes
      overexpressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α
      (PGC-1α, encoded by PPARGC1A), 61% of the analysed BCAA genes were
      upregulated, while 67% were downregulated in the quadriceps of skeletal
      muscle-specific Ppargc1a knockout mice. ESRRA (encoding ERRα) silencing
      completely abrogated the PGC-1α-induced upregulation of BCAA-related genes
      in primary human myotubes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Metabolic
      inflexibility in type 2 diabetes impacts BCAA homeostasis and attenuates
      the decrease in circulating and skeletal muscle BCAA-related metabolites
      after a glucose challenge. Transcriptional regulation of BCAA genes in
      primary human myotubes via PGC-1α is ERRα-dependent.

AB  - Diabetic nephropathy is a major complication of diabetes mellitus, and
      thus novel biomarkers are desired to evaluate the presence and progression
      of diabetic nephropathy. In this study, we sought to identify possible
      metabolites related to diabetic nephropathy among urinary eicosanoids and
      related mediators. Using liquid chromatogram-tandem mass spectrometry, we
      optimized the lipid extraction from urine using the Monospin C18 as a
      solid-phase extraction cartridge and measured the urinary lipid mediators
      in 111 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as 33 healthy
      subjects. We observed that 14 metabolites differed significantly among the
      clinical stages of nephropathy. Among them, levels of
      tetranor-prostaglandin E metabolite (tetranor-PGEM), an arachidonic acid
      metabolite, were significantly higher in subjects with stage 1 nephropathy
      than in healthy subjects and increased with the progression of
      nephropathy. We also observed that levels of maresin-1, a docosahexaenoic
      acid metabolite, and leukotriene B4-ethanolamide, an arachidonoyl
      ethanolamide metabolite, were significantly lower in subjects with stage
      3-4 nephropathy than in healthy subjects and those with stage 1-2
      nephropathy. Finally, using a comprehensive analysis of urinary
      eicosanoids and related mediators, we concluded that tetranor-PGEM was
      capable of discriminating clinical stages of nephropathy and thus useful
      as a novel biomarker for diabetic nephropathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current study is to accomplish a relative
      exploration of the biological roles of differentially dysregulated genes
      (DRGs) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study aimed to determine
      the impact of these DRGs on the biological pathways and networks that are
      related to the associated disorders and complications in T2DM and to
      predict its role as prospective biomarkers. METHODS: Datasets obtained
      from metabolomic and proteomic profiling were used for investigation of
      the differential expression of the genes. A subset of DRGs was integrated
      into IPA software to explore its biological pathways, related diseases,
      and their regulation in T2DM. Upon entry into the IPA, only 94 of the DRGs
      were recognizable, mapped, and matched within the database. RESULTS: The
      study identified networks that explore the dysregulation of several
      functions; cell components such as degranulation of cells; molecular
      transport process and metabolism of cellular proteins; and inflammatory
      responses. Top disorders associated with DRGs in T2DM are related to organ
      injuries such as renal damage, connective tissue disorders, and acute
      inflammatory disorders. Upstream regulator analysis predicted the role of
      several transcription factors of interest, such as STAT3 and HIF alpha, as
      well as many kinases such as JAK kinases, which affects the gene
      expression of the dataset in T2DM. Interleukin 6 (IL6) is the top
      regulator of the DRGs, followed by leptin (LEP). Monitoring the
      dysregulation of the coupled expression of the following biomarkers (TNF,
      IL6, LEP, AGT, APOE, F2, SPP1, and INS) highlights that they could be used
      as potential prognostic biomarkers. CONCLUSION: The integration of data
      obtained by advanced metabolomic and proteomic technologies has made it
      probable to advantage in understanding the role of these biomarkers in the
      identification of significant biological processes, pathways, and
      regulators that are associated with T2DM and its comorbidities.

AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is not fully
      understood. We investigated whether circulating levels of preselected
      proteins were associated with the outcome 'diabetes' and whether these
      associations were causal. METHODS: In 2467 individuals of the
      population-based, cross-sectional EpiHealth study (45-75 years, 50%
      women), 249 plasma proteins were analysed by the proximity extension assay
      technique. DNA was genotyped using the Illumina HumanCoreExome-12 v1.0
      BeadChip. Diabetes was defined as taking glucose-lowering treatment or
      having a fasting plasma glucose of ≥7.0 mmol/l. The associations between
      proteins and diabetes were assessed using logistic regression. To
      investigate causal relationships between proteins and diabetes, a
      bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomisation was performed based on
      large, genome-wide association studies belonging to the DIAGRAM and MAGIC
      consortia, and a genome-wide association study in the EpiHealth study.
      RESULTS: Twenty-six proteins were positively associated with diabetes,
      including cathepsin D, retinal dehydrogenase 1, α-L-iduronidase,
      hydroxyacid oxidase 1 and galectin-4 (top five findings). Three proteins,
      lipoprotein lipase, IGF-binding protein 2 and paraoxonase 3 (PON-3), were
      inversely associated with diabetes. Fourteen of the proteins are novel
      discoveries. The Mendelian randomisation study did not disclose any
      significant causal effects between the proteins and diabetes in either
      direction that were consistent with the relationships found between the
      protein levels and diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The 29 proteins
      associated with diabetes are involved in several physiological pathways,
      but given the power of the study no causal link was identified for those
      proteins tested in Mendelian randomisation. Therefore, the identified
      proteins are likely to be biomarkers for type 2 diabetes, rather than
      representing causal pathways.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), a major TB risk
      factor, are both accompanied by marked alterations in metabolic processes.
      Dissecting the specific metabolic changes induced by disease through
      metabolomics has shown potential to improve our understanding of relevant
      pathophysiological mechanisms of disease, which could lead to improved
      treatment. Targeted tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
      (LC-MS/MS) was used to compare amine and acylcarnitine levels in plasma
      samples of patients with TB or TB-DM from Indonesia at time of diagnosis
      and during antibiotic treatment. Partial least squares discrimination
      analysis (PLS-DA) showed good separation of patient groups. Amine levels
      were strongly altered in both disease groups compared to healthy controls,
      including low concentrations of citrulline and ornithine. Several amino
      acid ratios discriminated TB from controls (phenylalanine/histidine;
      citrulline/arginine; kynurenine/tryptophan), possibly reflecting changes
      in indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and nitric oxide synthase
      (NOS) activity. Choline, glycine, serine, threonine and homoserine levels
      were lower in TB-DM compared to TB, and, in contrast to other analytes,
      did not normalize to healthy control levels during antibiotic treatment.
      Our results not only provide important validation of previous studies but
      also identify novel biomarkers, and significantly enhance our
      understanding of metabolic changes in human TB and TB-DM.

AB  - Highly efficient extraction of peptides from serum is critical for finding
      serum biomarkers using mass spectrometry, which still remains a great
      challenge. Currently, a bottom-up proteomics approach has been applied to
      discover serum biomarkers. However, the approach was labor intensive, time
      and cost consuming, and cannot meet the requirements for clinical
      application. In this work, Fe3O4/C@MIL-100 composites were synthesized to
      efficiently capture peptides from microwave-assisted formic acid digests
      of BSA and human serum prior to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Fe3O4/C@MIL-100
      composites exhibited size-selective adsorption performance, thus providing
      a rapid and convenient approach to enrich low-abundance peptides. Notably,
      the peptides' mass fingerprinting of serum digestions between type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and healthy persons were distinguishable, which
      indicated the potential ability of this technique for T2DM diagnosis and
      rapid biomarker discovery. Graphical Abstract Efficient extraction and

AB  - UNLABELLED: Very low calorie diets (VLCD) with and without exercise
      programs lead to major metabolic improvements in obese type 2 diabetes
      patients. The mechanisms underlying these improvements have so far not
      been elucidated fully. To further investigate the mechanisms of a VLCD
      with or without exercise and to uncover possible biomarkers associated
      with these interventions, blood samples were collected from 27 obese type
      2 diabetes patients before and after a 16-week VLCD (Modifast ∼ 450
      kcal/day). Thirteen of these patients followed an exercise program in
      addition to the VCLD. Plasma was obtained from 27 lean and 27 obese
      controls as well. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry
      (MS) and targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and a large scale
      isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) approach.
      After the 16-week VLCD, there was a significant decrease in body weight
      and HbA1c in all patients, without differences between the two
      intervention groups. Targeted MRM analysis revealed differences in several
      proteins, which could be divided in diabetes-associated (fibrinogen,
      transthyretin), obesity-associated (complement C3), and diet-associated
      markers (apolipoproteins, especially apolipoprotein A-IV). To further
      investigate the effects of exercise, large scale iTRAQ analysis was
      performed. However, no proteins were found showing an exercise effect.
      Thus, in this study, specific proteins were found to be differentially
      expressed in type 2 diabetes patients versus controls and before and after
      a VLCD. These proteins are potential disease state and intervention
      specific biomarkers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Controlled-Trials.com

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is caused by the failure of the pancreatic
      beta-cell to secrete sufficient insulin to compensate a decreased response
      of peripheral tissues to insulin action. The pathological events causing
      beta-cell dysfunctions are only poorly understood and early markers that
      would predict islet function are missing. In contrast to immunoassays,
      unbiased proteomic technologies provide the opportunity to screen for
      novel marker protein and peptides of T2DM. An important subset of the
      proteome, peptides and peptide hormones secreted by the pancreas are
      deregulated in T2DM. The mass range of peptides and small proteins (1-20
      kDa) is only sufficiently targeted by peptidomics, a combination of liquid
      chromatographic and mass spectrometric (MS) peptide analysis. Here, we
      describe the application of isotope label-free quantitative peptidomics to
      display and quantify relevant changes in the level of pancreatic peptides
      and peptide hormones in a preclinical model of T2DM, the Lep(ob)/Lep(ob)
      mouse. The amino acid sequence of statistical relevant top candidates was
      determined by MS/MS fragmentation or Edman degradation. The comparison of
      lean versus obese mice revealed increased levels of islet-specific
      peptides that can be divided into the following categories 1) the major
      islet peptide hormones insulin, amylin and glucagon; 2) proinsulin and
      C-peptide and 3) novel processing products of secretogranin, glucagon and
      amylin. Furthermore, we found increased levels of proteins and peptides
      implicated in zymogen granule maturation (syncollin) and nutritional
      digestion. In summary, our findings demonstrate that peptidomics is a
      valid approach to screen for novel peptide biomarkers.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine and metabolic disorder
      affecting up to 15% of women at reproductive age. The main features of
      PCOS are hyperandrogenism and irregular menstrual cycles together with
      metabolic dysfunctions including hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance
      and a 4-fold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Despite the
      high prevalence the pathophysiology of the syndrome is unclear. Insulin
      resistance in women with PCOS likely affect the skeletal muscle and
      recently it was demonstrated that changes in DNA methylation affects the
      gene expression in skeletal muscle that in part can explain their
      metabolic abnormalities. The objective of this work was to combine gene
      expression array data from different datasets to improve statistical power
      and thereby identify novel biomarkers that can be further explored. In
      this narrative review, we performed a meta-analysis of skeletal muscle
      arrays available from Gene Expression Omnibus and from publications. The
      eligibility criteria were published articles in English, and baseline (no
      treatment) skeletal muscle samples from women with PCOS and controls. The
      R package Metafor was used for integration of the datasets. One hundred
      and fourteen unique transcripts were differentially expressed in skeletal
      muscle from women with PCOS vs. controls (q < 0.05), 87% of these
      transcripts have not been previously identified as altered in PCOS muscle.
      ING2, CDKAL1, and AKTIP had the largest differential increase in
      expression, and TSHZ2, FKBP2, and OCEL1 had the largest decrease in
      expression. Two genes, IRX3 and CDKAL1 were consistently upregulated (q <
      0.05) in the individual analyses and meta-analysis. Based on the
      meta-analysis, we identified several dysregulated immunometabolic pathways
      as a part of the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance in the
      skeletal muscle of women with PCOS. The transcriptomic data need to be
      verified by functional analyses as well as proteomics to advance our
      understanding of PCOS specific insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is still
      difficult. Screening of plasma biomarkers has great significance of
      optimizing diagnosis and predicting the complications of T2DM. METHODS: We
      used a special diet, Purina #5008, to induce diabetes in Zucker leptin
      receptor gene-deficient rats (fa/fa) to establish Zucker diabetic fatty
      (ZDF) rats, simulating the early stage of T2DM. The differentially
      expressed proteins (DEP) and lipids (DEL), as potential biomarkers, were
      screened to compare the plasma expression levels in ZDF rats and their
      basic diet-fed wild-type controls (fa/+) by Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) and
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: These two groups
      had different plasma proteins and lipids profiles consisting of 84 DEPs
      and, 179 DELs identified in the positive ion mode and 178 DELs in the
      negative ion mode, respectively. Enrichment analysis of these different
      indicators showed that oxidative stress, insulin resistance and metabolic
      disorders of glycan and lipid played an important role in generating the
      difference. Some markers can be used as candidate biomarkers in prediction
      and treatments of T2DM, such as ceruloplasmin, apolipoprotein C-I,
      apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein C-IV. CONCLUSION: These plasma
      differences help to optimize the diagnosis and predict the complications
      of T2DM, although this remains to be verified in the crowd. Trace elements
      related-metalloproteins, such as ceruloplasmin, and lipid metabolism and
      transport-related apolipoprotein C are expected to be candidate biomarkers
      of T2DM and should be given more attention.

AB  - PURPOSE: Diabetic patients are more likely to experience dry eye (DE).
      TMT-based proteomics and WGCNA are used to identify the differentially
      expressed proteins in tear proteome of type 2 diabetes with DE. The aim is
      to provide a molecular basis for exploring possible mechanisms underlying
      the pathogenesis of diabetic DE. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Subjects are divided
      into four groups (ten in each): type 2 diabetes with DE; type 2 diabetes
      without DE; non-diabetes with DE and normal controls. All subjects undergo
      DE tests. Total proteins are extracted and quantitatively labeled with
      TMT, then analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. WGCNA is
      used to identify the hub genes. Finally, differentially expressed proteins
      are validated by ELISA. RESULTS: A total of 1922 proteins are identified,
      of which 1814 contain quantitative information. Ultimately, 650 of these
      proteins yield quantitative values. WGCNA performed on these 650 proteins
      reveal four distinct hub genes of diabetic DE. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL
      RELEVANCE: DE is associated with the differential expression of tear
      proteins in type 2 diabetes. Inflammation, immune factors, and lipid
      metabolism may play a role in the development of diabetic DE. LTF, LYZ,
      ZAG, and DNAJC3 have the potential to be the biomarkers of DE in diabetes.

AB  - The incidence of type 2 diabetes is increasing more rapidly in adolescents
      than in any other age group. We identified and compared metabolite
      signatures in obese children with type 2 diabetes (T2D), obese children
      without diabetes (OB), and healthy, age- and gender-matched normal weight
      controls (NW) by measuring 273 analytes in fasting plasma and 24-hour
      urine samples from 90 subjects by targeted LC-MS/MS. Diabetic subjects
      were within 2 years of diagnosis in an attempt to capture early-stage
      disease prior to declining renal function. We found 22 urine metabolites
      that were uniquely associated with T2D when compared to OB and NW groups.
      The metabolites most significantly elevated in T2D youth included members
      of the betaine pathway, nucleic acid metabolism, and branched-chain amino
      acids (BCAAs) and their catabolites. Notably, the metabolite pattern in OB
      and T2D groups differed between urine and plasma, suggesting that urinary
      BCAAs and their intermediates behaved as a more specific biomarker for
      T2D, while plasma BCAAs associated with the obese, insulin resistant state
      independent of diabetes status. Correlative analysis of metabolites in the
      T2D signature indicated that betaine metabolites, BCAAs, and aromatic
      amino acids were associated with hyperglycemia, but BCAA acylglycine
      derivatives and nucleic acid metabolites were linked to insulin
      resistance. Of major interest, we found that urine levels of
      succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICA-riboside) were
      increased in diabetic youth, identifying urine SAICA-riboside as a
      potential biomarker for T2D.

AB  - Renal dysfunction, a major complication of type 2 diabetes, can be
      predicted from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and protein
      markers such as albumin concentration. Urinary protein biomarkers may be
      used to monitor or predict patient status. Urine samples were selected
      from patients enrolled in the retrospective diabetic kidney disease (DKD)
      study, including 35 with good and 19 with poor prognosis. After removal of
      albumin and immunoglobulin, the remaining proteins were reduced,
      alkylated, digested, and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively with a
      nano LC-MS platform. Each protein was identified, and its concentration
      normalized to that of creatinine. A prognostic model of DKD was formulated
      based on the adjusted quantities of each protein in the two groups. Of
      1296 proteins identified in the 54 urine samples, 66 were differentially
      abundant in the two groups (area under the curve (AUC): p-value < 0.05),
      but none showed significantly better performance than albumin. To improve
      the predictive power by multivariate analysis, five proteins (ACP2, CTSA,
      GM2A, MUC1, and SPARCL1) were selected as significant by an AUC-based
      random forest method. The application of two classifiers-support vector
      machine and random forest-showed that the multivariate model performed
      better than univariate analysis of mucin-1 (AUC: 0.935 vs. 0.791) and
      albumin (AUC: 1.0 vs. 0.722). The urinary proteome can reflect kidney
      function directly and can predict the prognosis of patients with chronic
      kidney dysfunction. Classification based on five urinary proteins may
      better predict the prognosis of DKD patients than urinary albumin
      concentration or eGFR.

AB  - Aim: An advanced proteomics platform for protein biomarker discovery in
      diabetic chronic kidney disease (DKD) was developed, validated and
      implemented. Materials & methods: Three Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients
      and three control subjects were enrolled. Urinary peptides were extracted,
      samples were analyzed on a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap Velos Pro instrument. Raw
      data were searched using the SEQUEST algorithm and integrated into
      Proteome Discoverer platform. Results & discussion: Unique peptide
      sequences, resulted sequence coverage, scoring of peptide spectrum matches
      were reported to albuminuria and databases. Five proteins that can be
      associated with early DKD were found: apolipoprotein AI, neutrophil
      gelatinase-associated lipocalin, cytidine deaminase, S100-A8 and
      hemoglobin subunit delta. Conclusion: Urinary proteome analysis could be
      used to evaluate mechanisms of pathogenesis of DKD.

AB  - Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is an important cause of renal dysfunction and the
      most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Diabetic nephropathy
      is also associated with an increased risk of vascular disease and patient
      mortality. Aggressive management of hypertension to reduce
      microalbuminuria, together with tight glycaemic control are important
      therapeutic strategies for renal and vascular disease prevention in T2D.
      The main pathophysiological mechanisms associated with diabetic
      nephropathy result from activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
      system (RAAS), protein kinase C pathway, pro-inflammatory cytokines and
      various growth factors. Angiotensin II and transforming growth factor-beta
      (TGF-beta) are two important molecular mediators. The production of
      advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and increased oxidative stress
      further exacerbates renal injury. These molecular changes within the renal
      tissue result in mesangial expansion, increased extracellular matrix
      deposition and an alteration in podocyte structure and function.
      Therapeutic targeting of these molecular pathways is an important area of
      translational research in diabetes. The elucidation of new genetic
      associations and proteomic biomarkers of diabetic kidney disease will also
      assist in the identification and treatment of high-risk patients. This
      review article will discuss both the molecular and clinical aspects of
      diabetic nephropathy, providing a bench-to-bedside research perspective to
      potential new therapeutic strategies.

AB  - AIM: Recombinant FGF21 analogs are under wide ranging investigations as a
      potential therapeutic agent for Type 2 diabetes, as well as other
      metabolic disorders. The endogenous FGF21 is often used as a surrogate
      pharmacodynamic(PD) biomarker to assess drug efficacy and safety. Results
      & methodology: Immunocapture was performed using a monoclonal antibody
      which had been generated to bind to specific domain of native FGF21 as the
      capture reagent. After immunocapture, enzymatic digestion was performed
      and a native FGF21-specific tryptic peptide was monitored using LC-MS/MS
      by selective reaction monitoring. CONCLUSION: We have successfully
      developed and validated a bioanalytical assay which provides the
      specificity to differentiate the endogenous FGF21 from the recombinant
      therapeutic agent which has nearly identical sequence to the endogenous
      molecule.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 24 hour urine exosome protein content changes among
      pregnant US subjects with diabetes and obesity during early pregnancy.
      METHODS: The exosome proteome content from 24 hour urine samples of
      pregnant subjects with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM, N=8) and
      pre-gestational Type 2 diabetes (PGD, N = 10) were compared with control
      samples (CTRL, N = 10) obtained at week 20 of pregnancy. Differences in
      exosome protein load between groups was identified by liquid
      chromatography/mass spectrometry, analyzed by linear regression in
      negative binomial distribution, visualized in MetaboAnalyst (version 3.0),
      and validated by western immunoblotting. RESULTS: At the 20th week of
      pregnancy, we identified 646, 734 and 856 proteins in exosomes from 24
      hour urine samples of patients from the CTRL, GDM and PGD groups,
      respectively. S100 calcium binding protein A9, damage associated molecular
      pattern (DAMP) signal, was found to be significantly increased in both GDM
      and PGD subjects. In GDM subjects the peptide counts for S100A9 protein
      independently correlated with maternal obesity and macrosomia of the
      newborn infants. Early to late pregnancy developmental changes in the GDM
      group were shown to utilize pathways and protein expression levels
      differently from those in PGD or CTRL groups. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary exosome
      proteomic analysis non-invasively provides insights into maternal changes
      during diabetic pregnancy. Exosome biomarkers early in pregnancy can be
      potentially used to better understand pathophysiologic mechanisms of
      diabetes at a cellular level, and to distinguish between gestational and
      pre-gestational diabetes at the pathway level. This information can aid
      intervention efforts to improve pregnancy outcomes in women with diabetes.
