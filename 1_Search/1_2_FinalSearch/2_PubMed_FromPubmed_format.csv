Metabolomics and proteomics, facilitated by recent advances in high-throughput technologies, have given us unprecedented insight into circulating biomarkers of T2D even over a decade before overt disease. These markers may be effective tools for diabetes mellitus screening, diagnosis, and prognosis. As participants of metabolic pathways, metabolite and protein markers may also highlight pathways involved in T2D development. The integration of metabolomics and proteomics with genomics in multiomics strategies provides an analytical method that can begin to decipher causal associations. These methods are not without their limitations; however, with careful study design and sample handling, these methods represent powerful scientific tools that can be leveraged for the study of T2D. In this article, we aim to give a timely overview of circulating metabolomics and proteomics findings with T2D observed in large human population studies to provide the reader with a snapshot into these emerging fields of research.","Chen, Zsu-ZsuGerszten, Robert E","Chen ZZGerszten RE","From the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism (Z.-Z.C.), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.Cardiovascular Institute (Z.-Z.C., R.E.G.), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.Cardiovascular Institute (Z.-Z.C., R.E.G.), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA (R.E.G.).","eng","R01 DK108159/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesP30 DK040561/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR01 DK081572/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesU24 DK112340/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL144483/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL132320/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL133870/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesT32 HL007374/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralReview","20200521","United States","Circ Res","Circulation research","0047103","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Proteome)","IM","AnimalsBiomarkers/bloodDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/genetics/*metabolismGenomics/*methodsHumans*MetabolomeProteome/genetics/*metabolism","PMC11118076","NIHMS1585000","NOTNLM","biomarkerscardiovascular diseasesdiabetes mellitus, type 2metabolomicsproteomics","Disclosures.

We present here, seven DNAm-based estimators of plasma proteins including those of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and growth differentiation factor 15. The resulting predictor of lifespan, DNAm GrimAge (in units of years), is a composite biomarker based on the seven DNAm surrogates and a DNAm-based estimator of smoking pack-years. Adjusting DNAm GrimAge for chronological age generated novel measure of epigenetic age acceleration, AgeAccelGrim.Using large scale validation data from thousands of individuals, we demonstrate that DNAm GrimAge stands out among existing epigenetic clocks in terms of its predictive ability for time-to-death (Cox regression P=2.0E-75), time-to-coronary heart disease (Cox P=6.2E-24), time-to-cancer (P= 1.3E-12), its strong relationship with computed tomography data for fatty liver/excess visceral fat, and age-at-menopause (P=1.6E-12). AgeAccelGrim is strongly associated with a host of age-related conditions including comorbidity count (P=3.45E-17). Similarly, age-adjusted DNAm PAI-1 levels are associated with lifespan (P=5.4E-28), comorbidity count (P= 7.3E-56) and type 2 diabetes (P=2.0E-26). These DNAm-based biomarkers show the expected relationship with lifestyle factors including healthy diet and educational attainment.Overall, these epigenetic biomarkers are expected to find many applications including human anti-aging studies.","Lu, Ake TQuach, AustinWilson, James GReiner, Alex PAviv, AbrahamRaj, KennethHou, LifangBaccarelli, Andrea ALi, YunStewart, James DWhitsel, Eric AAssimes, Themistocles LFerrucci, LuigiHorvath, Steve","Lu ATQuach AWilson JGReiner APAviv ARaj KHou LBaccarelli AALi YStewart JDWhitsel EAAssimes TLFerrucci LHorvath S","Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.Department of Human Genetics, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216, USA.Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.Center of Development and Aging, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers State University of New Jersey, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.Radiation Effects Department, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Public Health England, Chilton, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 0RQ, United Kingdom.Center for Population Epigenetics, Robert H.

These characteristics suggest that T2DM may be associated with AD, which gave rise to a new term, type 3 diabetes (T3DM). In this study, we searched for matching peripheral proteomic biomarkers of AD and T2DM based in a systematic review of the available literature.

Previous studies have evaluated the predictive utility of omics measurements, such as metabolites, proteins or polygenic scores, but have considered these separately. The improvement that combined omics biomarkers can provide over and above current clinical standard models is unclear. The aim of this study was to test the predictive performance of genome, proteome, metabolome and clinical biomarkers when added to established clinical prediction models for type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We developed sparse interpretable prediction models in a prospective, nested type 2 diabetes case-cohort study (N=1105, incident type 2 diabetes cases=375) with 10,792 person-years of follow-up, selecting from 5759 features across the genome, proteome, metabolome and clinical biomarkers using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. We compared the predictive performance of omics-derived predictors with a clinical model including the variables from the Cambridge Diabetes Risk Score and HbA(1c). RESULTS: Among single omics prediction models that did not include clinical risk factors, the top ten proteins alone achieved the highest performance (concordance index [C index]=0.82 [95% CI 0.75, 0.88]), suggesting the proteome as the most informative single omic layer in the absence of clinical information. However, the largest improvement in prediction of type 2 diabetes incidence over and above the clinical model was achieved by the top ten features across several omic layers (C index=0.87 [95% CI 0.82, 0.92], Δ C index=0.05, p=0.045). This improvement by the top ten omic features was also evident in individuals with HbA(1c) <42 mmol/mol (6.0%), the threshold for prediabetes (C index=0.84 [95% CI 0.77, 0.90], Δ C index=0.07, p=0.03), the group in whom prediction would be most useful since they are not targeted for preventative interventions by current clinical guidelines. In this subgroup, the type 2 diabetes polygenic risk score was the major contributor to the improvement in prediction, and achieved a comparable improvement in performance when added onto the clinical model alone (C index=0.83 [95% CI 0.75, 0.90], Δ C index=0.06, p=0.002). However, compared with those with prediabetes, individuals at high polygenic risk in this group had only around half the absolute risk for type 2 diabetes over a 20 year period. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Omic approaches provided marginal improvements in prediction of incident type 2 diabetes. However, while a polygenic risk score does improve prediction in people with an HbA(1c) in the normoglycaemic range, the group in whom prediction would be most useful, even individuals with a high polygenic burden in that subgroup had a low absolute type 2 diabetes risk. This suggests a limited feasibility of implementing targeted population-based genetic screening for preventative interventions.","Carrasco-Zanini, JuliaPietzner, MaikWheeler, EleanorKerrison, Nicola DLangenberg, ClaudiaWareham, Nicholas J","Carrasco-Zanini JPietzner MWheeler EKerrison NDLangenberg CWareham NJ","MRC Epidemiology Unit, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Institute of Metabolic Science, Cambridge, UK.Computational Medicine, Berlin Institute of Health at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.Precision Healthcare University Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.MRC Epidemiology Unit, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Institute of Metabolic Science, Cambridge, UK.Computational Medicine, Berlin Institute of Health at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.Precision Healthcare University Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.MRC Epidemiology Unit, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Institute of Metabolic Science, Cambridge, UK.MRC Epidemiology Unit, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Institute of Metabolic Science, Cambridge, UK.MRC Epidemiology Unit, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Institute of Metabolic Science, Cambridge, UK. claudia.langenberg@qmul.ac.uk.Computational Medicine, Berlin Institute of Health at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany. claudia.langenberg@qmul.ac.uk.Precision Healthcare University Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK. claudia.langenberg@qmul.ac.uk.MRC Epidemiology Unit, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge, Institute of Metabolic Science, Cambridge, UK.

Currently, urine and kidney biopsy specimens are the major clinical resources for DKD diagnosis. Our study proposes to evaluate the diagnostic value of blood in monitoring the onset of DKD and distinguishing its status in the clinic. METHODS: This study recruited 1,513 participants including healthy adults and patients diagnosed with 2-DM, early-stage DKD (DKD-E), and advanced-stage DKD (DKD-A) from 4 independent medical centers. One discovery and four testing cohorts were established. Sera were collected and subjected to training proteomics and large-scale metabolomics. RESULTS: Deep profiling of serum proteomes and metabolomes revealed several insights. First, the training proteomics revealed that the combination of α(2)-macroglobulin, cathepsin D, and CD324 could serve as a surrogate protein biomarker for monitoring DKD progression. Second, metabolomics demonstrated that galactose metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism are the major disturbed metabolic pathways in DKD, and serum metabolite glycerol-3-galactoside could be used as an independent marker to predict DKD. Third, integrating proteomics and metabolomics increased the diagnostic and predictive stability and accuracy for distinguishing DKD status. CONCLUSIONS: Serum integrative omics provide stable and accurate biomarkers for early warning and diagnosis of DKD. Our study provides a rich and open-access data resource for optimizing DKD management.","Liu, ShijiaGui, YuanWang, Mark SZhang, LuXu, TingtingPan, YuchenZhang, KeYu, YingXiao, LiangxiangQiao, YiBonin, ChristopherHargis, GenevaHuan, TaoYu, YanbaoTao, JianlingZhang, RongKreutzer, Donald LZhou, YanjiaoTian, Xiao-JunWang, YanlinFu, HaiyanAn, XiaofeiLiu, SilviaZhou, Dong","Liu SGui YWang MSZhang LXu TPan YZhang KYu YXiao LQiao YBonin CHargis GHuan TYu YTao JZhang RKreutzer DLZhou YTian XJWang YFu HAn XLiu SZhou D","Affiliated Hosptial of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China; IIT Research Institute, Chicago, IL, USA.Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, USA.Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, USA.Affiliated Hosptial of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.Affiliated Hosptial of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.Department of Biostatistics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Department of Life Sciences and Institute of Genome Sciences, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan.Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Renal Division, The 3rd Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Renal Division, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Renal Division, Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.Department of Surgery, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, USA.University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, USA.University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, USA.Department of Chemistry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA.Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA.Department of Surgery, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, USA.University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, USA.School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA.Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, USA.Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.Affiliated Hosptial of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China; Vascular Biology Center, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, GA, USA.

Currently, it is believed that the interaction between intestinal microbiota and bile acids (BAs) metabolism mediates host metabolism and promotes T2DM. PURPOSE: To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of JTSH for treating T2DM with animal models. METHODS: In this study, male SD rats received high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) injection to induce T2DM and were treated with different dosages (0.27, 0.54 and 1.08 g/kg) of JTSH pill for 4 weeks; metformin was given as a positive control. Alterations of gut microbiota and BA profiles in the distal ileum were assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), respectively. Additionally, we conducted quantitative Real Time-PCR and western blotting to determine the mRNA and protein expression levels of intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR), fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) as well as hepatic cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily a, poly-peptide 1 (CYP7A1) and cytochrome P450, family 8, subfamily b, poly-peptide 1 (CYP8B1), which are involved in BAs metabolism and enterohepatic circulation. RESULTS: Here, the results revealed that JTSH treatment significantly ameliorated hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance (IR), hyperlipidaemia, and pathological changes in the pancreas, liver, kidney and intestine and reduced the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in T2DM model rats. 16S rRNA sequencing and UPLC-MS/MS showed that JTSH treatment could modulate gut microbiota dysbiosis by preferentially increasing bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium) with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity, which might in turn lead to the accumulation of ileal unconjugated BAs (e.g., CDCA, DCA) and further upregulate the intestinal FXR/FGF15 and TGR5/GLP-1 signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that JTSH treatment could alleviate T2DM by modulating the interaction between gut microbiota and BAs metabolism. These findings suggest that JTSH pill may serve as a promising oral therapeutic agent for T2DM.","Tawulie, DinaJin, LuluShang, XinLi, YimeiSun, LeXie, HaixueZhao, JieLiao, JiabaoZhu, ZhangzhiCui, HuantianWen, Weibo","Tawulie DJin LShang XLi YSun LXie HZhao JLiao JZhu ZCui HWen W","The First School of Clinical Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510405, China; Lingnan Medical Research Center, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510405, China.Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, China.The First School of Clinical Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510405, China.The First School of Clinical Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510405, China.The First School of Clinical Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510405, China.Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Kunming 650021, China.Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Kunming 650021, China.Department of Emergency, Jiaxing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China; Jiaxing Key Laboratory of Diabetic Angiopathy Research, Jiaxing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiaxing 314033, China.The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou 510405, China.

Prognostic biomarkers of disease progression have thus been the focus of intense research, but none are part of routine practice. OBJECTIVES: To identify and catalogue candidate biomarkers of disease progression in psoriasis for the translational research community. METHODS: A systematic search of CENTRAL, Embase, LILACS and MEDLINE was performed for relevant articles published between 1990 and December 2021. Eligibility criteria were studies involving patients with psoriasis (any age, n ≥ 50) reporting biomarkers associated with disease progression. The main outcomes were any measure of skin severity or any prespecified psoriasis comorbidity. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second; studies meeting minimal quality criteria (longitudinal design and/or use of methods to control for confounding) were formally assessed for bias. Candidate biomarkers were identified by an expert multistakeholder group using a majority voting consensus exercise, and mapped to relevant cellular and molecular pathways. RESULTS: Of 181 included studies, most investigated genomic or proteomic biomarkers associated with disease severity (n = 145) or psoriatic arthritis (n = 30). Methodological and reporting limitations compromised interpretation of findings, most notably a lack of longitudinal studies, and inadequate control for key prognostic factors. The following candidate biomarkers with future potential utility were identified for predicting disease severity: LCE3D, interleukin (IL)23R, IL23A, NFKBIL1 loci, HLA-C*06:02 (genomic), IL-17A, IgG aHDL, GlycA, I-FABP and kallikrein 8 (proteomic), tyramine (metabolomic); psoriatic arthritis: HLA-C*06:02, HLA-B*27, HLA-B*38, HLA-B*08, and variation at the IL23R and IL13 loci (genomic); IL-17A, CXCL10, Mac-2 binding protein, integrin b5, matrix metalloproteinase-3 and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (proteomic) and tyramine and mucic acid (metabolomic); and type 2 diabetes mellitus: variation in IL12B and IL23R loci (genomic). No biomarkers were supported by sufficient evidence for clinical use without further validation. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a comprehensive catalogue of investigated biomarkers of disease progression in psoriasis. Future studies must address the common methodological limitations identified herein to expedite discovery and validation of biomarkers for clinical use. What is already known about this topic? The current treatment paradigm in psoriasis is reactive. There is a need to develop effective risk-stratified management approaches that can proactively attenuate the substantial burden of disease. Prognostic biomarkers of disease progression have therefore been the focus of intense research. What does this study add? This review is the first to scope, collate and catalogue research investigating biomarkers of disease progression in psoriasis. The review identifies potentially promising candidate biomarkers for further investigation and highlights common important limitations that should be considered when designing and conducting future studies in this area.","Ramessur, RaviCorbett, MarkMarshall, DavidAcencio, Marcio LBarbosa, Ines ADand, NickDi Meglio, PaolaHaddad, SalmaJensen, Andreas H MKoopmann, WitteMahil, Satveer KOstaszewski, MarekRahmatulla, SeherRastrick, JoeSaklatvala, JakeWeidinger, StephanWright, KathEyerich, KilianNdlovu, MatladiBarker, Jonathan NSkov, LoneConrad, CurdinSmith, Catherine H","Ramessur RAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4599-9455Corbett MMarshall DAcencio MLAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8278-240XBarbosa IADand NAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1805-6278Di Meglio PAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2066-7780Haddad SJensen AHMAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2589-8676Koopmann WMahil SKOstaszewski MRahmatulla SAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5106-4237Rastrick JSaklatvala JWeidinger SAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3944-252XWright KEyerich KNdlovu MBarker JNSkov LAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4784-9680Conrad CSmith CH","St John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences and Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, UK.Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, UK.Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, UK.Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.St John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences and Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, UK.St John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences and Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, UK.St John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences and Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, UK.University College Hospital NHS Trust, London, UK.University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Department of Translational Medicine, LEO Pharma A/S, Ballerup, Denmark.St John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences and Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, UK.Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.West Hertfordshire NHS Trust, Hertfordshire, UK.Department of Immunology Research, UCB, Belgium.St John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences and Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, UK.Department of Dermatology and Allergy, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, UK.Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Insitutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Department of Immunology Research, UCB, Belgium.St John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences and Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, UK.Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Department of Dermatology, Lausanne University Hospital CHUV & University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.St John's Institute of Dermatology, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences and Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, School of Basic & Medical Biosciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, UK.","eng","MR/S003126/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United KingdomMR/T02383X/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom","Journal ArticleScoping Review","20220711","England","Br J Dermatol","The British journal of dermatology","0004041","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)0 (HLA-C Antigens)0 (Immunoglobulin G)0 (Integrins)0 (Interleukin-13)0 (Interleukin-17)0 (Interleukins)EC 3.4.21.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the regulation and function of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1) in lipid overload-induced cardiomyocyte death and heart dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) developed signs of obesity and type II diabetes mellitus, including hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertension. HFD for 18 weeks also induced heart hypertrophy, fibrosis, myocardial insulin resistance, and cardiomyocyte death. HFD stimulated mitochondrial fission in mouse hearts. Furthermore, HFD increased the protein level, phosphorylation (at the activating serine 616 sites), oligomerization, mitochondrial translocation, and GTPase activity of Drp1 in mouse hearts, indicating that Drp1 was activated. Monkeys fed a diet high in fat and cholesterol for 2.5 years also exhibited myocardial damage and Drp1 activation in the heart. Interestingly, HFD decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized) levels and increased Drp1 acetylation in the heart. In adult cardiomyocytes, palmitate increased Drp1 acetylation, phosphorylation, and protein levels, and these increases were abolished by restoration of the decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized) level. Proteomics analysis and in vitro screening revealed that Drp1 acetylation at lysine 642 (K642) was increased by HFD in mouse hearts and by palmitate incubation in cardiomyocytes. The nonacetylated Drp1 mutation (K642R) attenuated palmitate-induced Drp1 activation, its interaction with voltage-dependent anion channel 1, mitochondrial fission, contractile dysfunction, and cardiomyocyte death. CONCLUSIONS: These findings uncover a novel mechanism that contributes to lipid overload-induced heart hypertrophy and dysfunction. Excessive lipid supply created an intracellular environment that facilitated Drp1 acetylation, which, in turn, increased its activity and mitochondrial translocation, resulting in cardiomyocyte dysfunction and death. Thus, Drp1 may be a critical mediator of lipid overload-induced heart dysfunction as well as a potential target for therapy.","Hu, QingxunZhang, HuiliangGutiérrez Cortés, NicolásWu, DanWang, PeiZhang, JingMattison, Julie ASmith, EricBettcher, Lisa FWang, MingyiLakatta, Edward GSheu, Shey-ShingWang, Wang","Hu QZhang HGutiérrez Cortés NWu DWang PZhang JMattison JASmith EBettcher LFWang MLakatta EGSheu SSWang W","From the Mitochondria and Metabolism Center, Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine (Q.H., H.Z., N.G.C., D.W., P.W., E.S., L.F.B., W.W.), University of Washington, Seattle.From the Mitochondria and Metabolism Center, Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine (Q.H., H.Z., N.G.C., D.W., P.W., E.S., L.F.B., W.W.), University of Washington, Seattle.Department of Pathology (H.Z., W.W.), University of Washington, Seattle.From the Mitochondria and Metabolism Center, Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine (Q.H., H.Z., N.G.C., D.W., P.W., E.S., L.F.B., W.W.), University of Washington, Seattle.From the Mitochondria and Metabolism Center, Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine (Q.H., H.Z., N.G.C., D.W., P.W., E.S., L.F.B., W.W.), University of Washington, Seattle.Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China (D.W.).From the Mitochondria and Metabolism Center, Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine (Q.H., H.Z., N.G.C., D.W., P.W., E.S., L.F.B., W.W.), University of Washington, Seattle.Laboratory of Cardiovascular Sciences, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Center (BRC), Baltimore, MD (J.Z., M.W., E.G.L.).Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, NIH Animal Center, Dickerson, MD (J.A.M.).From the Mitochondria and Metabolism Center, Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine (Q.H., H.Z., N.G.C., D.W., P.W., E.S., L.F.B., W.W.), University of Washington, Seattle.From the Mitochondria and Metabolism Center, Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine (Q.H., H.Z., N.G.C., D.W., P.W., E.S., L.F.B., W.W.), University of Washington, Seattle.Northwest Metabolomics Research Center, Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine (L.F.B.), University of Washington, Seattle.Laboratory of Cardiovascular Sciences, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Center (BRC), Baltimore, MD (J.Z., M.W., E.G.L.).Laboratory of Cardiovascular Sciences, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Center (BRC), Baltimore, MD (J.Z., M.W., E.G.L.).Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Medicine, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA (S.-S.S.).From the Mitochondria and Metabolism Center, Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine (Q.H., H.Z., N.G.C., D.W., P.W., E.S., L.F.B., W.W.), University of Washington, Seattle.Department of Pathology (H.Z., W.W.), University of Washington, Seattle.","eng","S10 OD010408/OD/NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL137266/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL114760/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesP30 EY001730/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL093671/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesP30 DK017047/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL110349/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL142864/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20200103","United States","Circ Res","Circulation research","0047103","0 (Lipids)EC 3.6.5.5 (Dnm1l protein, mouse)EC 3.6.5.5 (Dynamins)","IM","AcetylationAnimalsCardiomegaly/genetics/physiopathologyCell Death/geneticsDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/etiology/metabolismDiet, High-Fat/adverse effectsDynamins/genetics/*metabolismFemaleHyperglycemia/etiology/metabolismHyperinsulinism/etiology/metabolismHyperlipidemias/etiology/metabolismHypertension/etiology/metabolismLipids/*analysisMacaca mulattaMaleMice, Inbred C57BLMutationMyocytes, Cardiac/*metabolism/pathologyObesity/etiology/metabolismRats, Sprague-Dawley","PMC7035202","NIHMS1549156","NOTNLM","acetylationdiabetes mellitusdynaminsheartmitochondria",NA,"2020/01/04 06:00","2020/07/28 06:00","2021/02/14","2020/01/04 06:00","2020/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]2020/07/28 06:00 [medline]2020/01/04 06:00 [entrez]2021/02/14 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315252 [doi]","ppublish","Circ Res. 2020 Feb 14;126(4):456-470. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.119.315252.

However, characterising epigenetic influences could further inform disease predictions. Here, we leverage epigenome-wide data to study links between the DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of the circulating proteome and incident diseases. Using data from four cohorts, we trained and tested epigenetic scores (EpiScores) for 953 plasma proteins, identifying 109 scores that explained between 1% and 58% of the variance in protein levels after adjusting for known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) genetic effects. By projecting these EpiScores into an independent sample (Generation Scotland; n = 9537) and relating them to incident morbidities over a follow-up of 14 years, we uncovered 137 EpiScore-disease associations. These associations were largely independent of immune cell proportions, common lifestyle and health factors, and biological aging. Notably, we found that our diabetes-associated EpiScores highlighted previous top biomarker associations from proteome-wide assessments of diabetes. These EpiScores for protein levels can therefore be a valuable resource for disease prediction and risk stratification.","Gadd, Danni AHillary, Robert FMcCartney, Daniel LZaghlool, Shaza BStevenson, Anna JCheng, YipengFawns-Ritchie, ChloeNangle, CliffCampbell, ArchieFlaig, RobinHarris, Sarah EWalker, Rosie MShi, LiuTucker-Drob, Elliot MGieger, ChristianPeters, AnnetteWaldenberger, MelanieGraumann, JohannesMcRae, Allan FDeary, Ian JPorteous, David JHayward, CarolineVisscher, Peter MCox, Simon REvans, Kathryn LMcIntosh, Andrew MSuhre, KarstenMarioni, Riccardo E","Gadd DAAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6398-5407Hillary RFMcCartney DLZaghlool SBStevenson AJCheng YFawns-Ritchie CNangle CAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5432-1158Campbell AFlaig RHarris SEAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4941-5106Walker RMShi LTucker-Drob EMGieger CPeters AWaldenberger MGraumann JMcRae AFDeary IJPorteous DJHayward CVisscher PMCox SREvans KLMcIntosh AMSuhre KAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9638-3912Marioni REAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4430-4260","Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Education City, Doha, Qatar.Computer Engineering Department, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, United States.Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Cancer, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.Lothian Birth Cohorts, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, Chancellor's Building, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.Department of Psychology, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, United States.Population Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, United States.Research Unit Molecular Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Neuherberg, Germany.Research Unit Molecular Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany.Scientific Service Group Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry, Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, W.G.

Epigenetics can track how the environment and even certain behaviors add or remove small chemical markers to the DNA that makes up the genome. The type and location of these markers may affect whether genes are active or silent, this is, whether the protein coded for by that gene is being produced or not. One common epigenetic marker is known as DNA methylation. DNA methylation has been linked to the levels of a range of proteins in our cells and the risk people have of developing chronic diseases. Blood samples can be used to determine the epigenetic markers a person has on their genome and to study the abundance of many proteins. Gadd, Hillary, McCartney, Zaghlool et al. studied the relationships between DNA methylation and the abundance of 953 different proteins in blood samples from individuals in the German KORA cohort and the Scottish Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. They then used machine learning to analyze the relationship between epigenetic markers found in people’s blood and the abundance of proteins, obtaining epigenetic scores or ‘EpiScores’ for each protein. They found 109 proteins for which DNA methylation patterns explained between at least 1% and up to 58% of the variation in protein levels. Integrating the ‘EpiScores’ with 14 years of medical records for more than 9000 individuals from the Generation Scotland study revealed 130 connections between EpiScores for proteins and a future diagnosis of common adverse health outcomes. These included diabetes, stroke, depression, various cancers, and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Age-related chronic diseases are a growing issue worldwide and place pressure on healthcare systems. They also severely reduce quality of life for individuals over many years. This work shows how epigenetic scores based on protein levels in the blood could predict a person’s risk of several of these diseases. In the case of type 2 diabetes, the EpiScore results replicated previous research linking protein levels in the blood to future diagnosis of diabetes. Protein EpiScores could therefore allow researchers to identify people with the highest risk of disease, making it possible to intervene early and prevent these people from developing chronic conditions as they age.OABL eng",NA,"NOTNLM","agingbiomarkerepidemiologyepigeneticgeneticsgenomicsglobal healthhumanmorbiditiypredictionproteomics","DG, DM, SZ, AS, YC, CF, CN, AC, RF, SH, RW, LS, ET, CG, AP, MW, JG, AM, ID, DP, CH, PV, SC, KE, AM, KS No competing interests declared, RH has received consultant fees from Illumina, RM has received speaker fees from Illumina and is an advisor to the Epigenetic Clock Development Foundation","2022/01/14 06:00","2022/03/18 06:00","2022/01/13","2022/01/13 12:22","2021/06/30 00:00 [received]2022/01/11 00:00 [accepted]2022/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]2022/03/18 06:00 [medline]2022/01/13 12:22 [entrez]2022/01/13 00:00 [pmc-release]","71802 [pii]10.7554/eLife.71802 [doi]","epublish","Elife. 2022 Jan 13;11:e71802. doi: 10.7554/eLife.71802.","© 2022, Gadd et al.",NA,NA,"10.7554/eLife.71802",NA,2022

In this study, quantitative proteomics acquired from a mouse model were first analyzed. At the same time, functional pathway analysis helped identify functional pathways at the protein level. Then, bioinformatics on mRNA sequencing data were conducted between sepsis and normal mouse models. Differential expressional genes with the closest relationship to disease status and development were identified through module correlation analysis. Then, common biomarkers in proteomics and transcriptomics were extracted as target biomarkers. Through analyzing expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), colocalization analysis on Apoa2 and sepsis phenotype was conducted by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). Then, two-sample and drug-target, syndrome Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were all conducted using the Twosample R package. For protein level, protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) of the target biomarker were also included in MR. Animal experiments helped validate these results. As a result, Apoa2 protein or mRNA was identified as a target biomarker for H(2) with a protective, causal relationship with sepsis. HDL and type 2 diabetes were proven to possess causal relationships with sepsis. The agitation and inhibition of Apoa2 were indicated to influence sepsis and related syndromes. In conclusion, we first proposed Apoa2 as a target for H(2) treatment.","Wang, YuanlinFan, YanJiang, YiWang, EnquanSong, YuChen, HongguangXu, FeierXie, KeliangYu, Yonghao","Wang YFan YJiang YWang ESong YChen HXu FXie KYu Y","Department of Anesthesiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China.Department of Critical Care Medicine, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China.Department of Anesthesiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China.Department of Anesthesiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China.Department of Anesthesiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China.Department of Anesthesiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China.Department of Anesthesiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China.Department of Critical Care Medicine, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China.Department of Anesthesiology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China.","eng","TJWJ2022XK006/Tianjin Health Research Project/82202400/National Natural Science Foundation of China/","Journal Article","20230711","Switzerland","Int J Mol Sci","International journal of molecular sciences","101092791","0 (Biomarkers)7YNJ3PO35Z (Hydrogen)0 (amyloidogenic apolipoprotein A-II, mouse)0 (Apolipoprotein A-II)","IM","AnimalsMiceBiomarkers*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2Genetic Predisposition to DiseaseGenome-Wide Association StudyGenomicsHydrogen/pharmacology/therapeutic use*Lung InjuryPolymorphism, Single NucleotideProteomics*Sepsis/drug therapy/genetics*Apolipoprotein A-II/genetics/metabolism","PMC10379236",NA,"NOTNLM","GWASMendelian randomizationPWASgenomemolecular hydrogenproteomicsseptic lung injury","All authors declare that they have no competing interest.","2023/07/29 11:53","2023/07/31 11:41","2023/07/11","2023/07/29 01:21","2023/06/05 00:00 [received]2023/06/30 00:00 [revised]2023/07/03 00:00 [accepted]2023/07/31 11:41 [medline]2023/07/29 11:53 [pubmed]2023/07/29 01:21 [entrez]2023/07/11 00:00 [pmc-release]","ijms241411325 [pii]ijms-24-11325 [pii]10.3390/ijms241411325 [doi]","epublish","Int J Mol Sci. 2023 Jul 11;24(14):11325. doi: 10.3390/ijms241411325.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/ijms241411325",NA,2023

However, the biological intermediates driving this relationship are not fully understood. As novel interventions for treating and managing type 2 diabetes become increasingly available, whether they also disrupt the pathways leading to increased cancer risk is currently unknown. We investigated the effect of a type 2 diabetes intervention, in the form of intentional weight loss, on circulating proteins associated with cancer risk to gain insight into potential mechanisms linking type 2 diabetes and adiposity with cancer development. METHODS: Fasting serum samples from participants with diabetes enrolled in the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) receiving the Counterweight-Plus weight-loss programme (intervention, N = 117, mean weight-loss 10 kg, 46% diabetes remission) or best-practice care by guidelines (control, N = 143, mean weight-loss 1 kg, 4% diabetes remission) were subject to proteomic analysis using the Olink Oncology-II platform (48% of participants were female; 52% male). To identify proteins which may be altered by the weight-loss intervention, the difference in protein levels between groups at baseline and 1 year was examined using linear regression. Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to extend these results to evaluate cancer risk and elucidate possible biological mechanisms linking type 2 diabetes and cancer development. MR analyses were conducted using independent datasets, including large cancer meta-analyses, UK Biobank, and FinnGen, to estimate potential causal relationships between proteins modified during intentional weight loss and the risk of colorectal, breast, endometrial, gallbladder, liver, and pancreatic cancers. FINDINGS: Nine proteins were modified by the intervention: glycoprotein Nmb; furin; Wnt inhibitory factor 1; toll-like receptor 3; pancreatic prohormone; erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2; hepatocyte growth factor; endothelial cell specific molecule 1 and Ret proto-oncogene (Holm corrected P-value <0.05). Mendelian randomization analyses indicated a causal relationship between predicted circulating furin and glycoprotein Nmb on breast cancer risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.67-0.99, P-value = 0.03; and OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.78-0.99, P-value = 0.04 respectively), though these results were not supported in sensitivity analyses examining violations of MR assumptions. INTERPRETATION: Intentional weight loss among individuals with recently diagnosed diabetes may modify levels of cancer-related proteins in serum. Further evaluation of the proteins identified in this analysis could reveal molecular pathways that mediate the effect of adiposity and type 2 diabetes on cancer risk. FUNDING: The main sources of funding for this work were Diabetes UK, Cancer Research UK, World Cancer Research Fund, and Wellcome.","Bull, Caroline JHazelwood, EmmaLegge, Danny NCorbin, Laura JRichardson, Tom GLee, MatthewYarmolinsky, JamesSmith-Byrne, KarlHughes, David AJohansson, MattiasPeters, UlrikeBerndt, Sonja IBrenner, HermannBurnett-Hartman, AndreaCheng, IonaKweon, Sun-SeogLe Marchand, LoicLi, LiNewcomb, Polly APearlman, RachelMcConnachie, AlexWelsh, PaulTaylor, RoyLean, Mike E JSattar, NaveedMurphy, NeilGunter, Marc JTimpson, Nicholas JVincent, Emma E","Bull CJHazelwood ELegge DNCorbin LJRichardson TGLee MYarmolinsky JSmith-Byrne KHughes DAJohansson MPeters UBerndt SIBrenner HBurnett-Hartman ACheng IKweon SSLe Marchand LLi LNewcomb PAPearlman RMcConnachie AWelsh PTaylor RLean MEJSattar NMurphy NGunter MJTimpson NJVincent EE","MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; School of Translational Health Sciences, Dorothy Hodgkin Building, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.School of Translational Health Sciences, Dorothy Hodgkin Building, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.Section of Nutrition and Metabolism, International Agency for Research on Cancer, WHO, Lyon, France.MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Oxford Population Health, University of Oxford, UK.MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.Section of Nutrition and Metabolism, International Agency for Research on Cancer, WHO, Lyon, France.Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; Division of Preventive Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.Institute for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Denver, CO, USA.Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.Department of Preventive Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea; Jeonnam Regional Cancer Center, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.University of Hawaii Cancer Center, Honolulu, HI, USA.Department of Family Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA; School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.Division of Human Genetics, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8QQ, UK.School of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Health, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.Human Nutrition, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Nursing, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.School of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Health, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.Section of Nutrition and Metabolism, International Agency for Research on Cancer, WHO, Lyon, France.Section of Nutrition and Metabolism, International Agency for Research on Cancer, WHO, Lyon, France; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, UK.MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK; School of Translational Health Sciences, Dorothy Hodgkin Building, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.

Fortunately, various ""omics"" tools have been employed to better understand the progression pathologies of T2DM and its complications. More specifically, proteomics, metabolomics and metagenomics have played crucial roles in advancing deeper understanding of the physiological processes and regulatory mechanisms of T2DM, such as regulation of signaling pathways perturbed by glucose levels, intestinal microorganism, and inflammation and so on. By analyzing the dynamic change and modification of proteins, proteomics has become an important tool in biology and medicine. Metabolomic analysis can amplify and quantify metabolites in living organisms to reveal the relative relationship between metabolites and physiological and pathological changes. There are also increasing evidences that the human microbiome, specifically the gastrointestinal microbiome have a potential role in the etiology and pathological outcomes of T2DM and its complications. This article summarized and discussed the recent applications of these ""omics"" tools in finding biomarkers for T2DM and its complications. We also reviewed employing multiple ""omics"" to further advance our understanding of this pathology.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify proteomic biomarkers associated with incident T2D and assess its joint effect with dietary or lifestyle factors on the T2D risk. METHODS: We established 2 nested case-control studies for incident T2D: discovery cohort (median 6.5 years of follow-up, 285 case-control pairs) and validation cohort (median 2.8 years of follow-up, 38 case-control pairs). We integrated untargeted mass spectrometry-based proteomics and interpretable machine learning to identify T2D-related proteomic biomarkers. We constructed a protein risk score (PRS) with the identified proteomic biomarkers and used a generalized estimating equation to evaluate PRS-T2D relationship with repeated profiled proteome. We evaluated association of PRS with trajectory of glycemic traits in another non-T2D cohort (n = 376). Multiplicative interactions of dietary or lifestyle factors with PRS were evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Seven proteins (SHBG, CAND1, APOF, SELL, MIA3, CFH, IGHV1-2) were retained as the proteomic biomarkers for incident T2D. PRS (per SD change) was positively associated with incident T2D across 2 cohorts, with an odds ratio 1.29 (95% CI, 1.08-1.54) and 1.84 (1.19-2.84), respectively. Participants with a higher PRS had a higher probability showing unfavored glycemic trait trajectory in the non-T2D cohort. Red meat intake and PRS showed a multiplicative interaction on T2D risk in the discovery (P = 0.003) and validation cohort (P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: This study identified proteomic biomarkers for incident T2D among the Chinese populations. The higher intake of red meat may synergistically interact with the proteomic biomarkers to exaggerate the T2D risk.","Gou, WanglongYue, LiangTang, Xin-YiWu, Yan-YanCai, XueShuai, MengleiMiao, ZeleiFu, YuanqingChen, HaoJiang, ZengliangWang, JialiTian, YunyiXiao, CongmeiXiang, NanWu, ZhenChen, Yu-MingGuo, TiannanZheng, Ju-Sheng","Gou WYue LTang XYWu YYCai XShuai MMiao ZFu YAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-3955-9376Chen HJiang ZWang JTian YAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7084-5813Xiao CXiang NWu ZChen YMAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-1658-5528Guo TAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3869-7651Zheng JSAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6560-4890","Key Laboratory of Growth Regulation and Translational Research of Zhejiang Province, School of Life Sciences, Westlake University, Hangzhou, China.Westlake Intelligent Biomarker Discovery Lab, Westlake Laboratory of Life Sciences and Biomedicine, Hangzhou, China.Westlake Intelligent Biomarker Discovery Lab, Westlake Laboratory of Life Sciences and Biomedicine, Hangzhou, China.Key Laboratory of Structural Biology of Zhejiang Province, School of Life Sciences, Westlake University, Hangzhou, China.Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Westlake Institute for Advanced Study, Hangzhou, China.The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Food, Nutrition and Health;

However, identifying HFpEF in individuals with type 2 diabetes early on is often challenging due to a limited array of biomarkers. This study aims to investigate specific biomarkers associated with the progression of HFpEF in individuals with type 2 diabetes, for the purpose of enabling early detection and more effective management strategies. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from individuals with type 2 diabetes, both with and without HFpEF, for proteomic analysis. Plasma integrin α1 (ITGA1) levels were measured and compared between the two groups. Participants were further categorised based on ITGA1 levels and underwent detailed transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and during a median follow-up period of 30 months. Multivariable linear and Cox regression analyses were conducted separately to assess the associations between plasma ITGA1 levels and changes in echocardiography indicators and re-hospitalisation risk. Additionally, proteomic data for the individuals' left ventricles, from ProteomeXchange database, were analysed to uncover mechanisms underlying the change in ITGA1 levels in HFpEF. RESULTS: Individuals with type 2 diabetes and HFpEF showed significantly higher plasma ITGA1 levels than the individuals with type 2 diabetes without HFpEF. These elevated ITGA1 levels were associated with left ventricular remodelling and impaired diastolic function. Furthermore, during a median follow-up of 30 months, multivariable analysis revealed that elevated ITGA1 levels independently correlated with deterioration of both diastolic and systolic cardiac functions. Additionally, higher baseline plasma ITGA1 levels independently predicted re-hospitalisation risk (HR 2.331 [95% CI 1.387, 3.917], p=0.001). Proteomic analysis of left ventricular myocardial tissue provided insights into the impact of increased ITGA1 levels on cardiac fibrosis-related pathways and the contribution made by these changes to the development and progression of HFpEF. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: ITGA1 serves as a biomarker for monitoring cardiac structural and functional damage, can be used to accurately diagnose the presence of HFpEF, and can be used to predict potential deterioration in cardiac structure and function as well as re-hospitalisation for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Its measurement holds promise for facilitating risk stratification and early intervention to mitigate the adverse cardiovascular effects associated with diabetes. DATA AVAILABILITY: The proteomic data of left ventricular myocardial tissue from individuals with type 2 diabetes, encompassing both those with and without HFpEF, is available from the ProteomeXchange database at http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org .","Su, MengqiHou, YilinCai, SidongLi, WenpengWei, YinxiaWang, RunWu, MinLiu, MingyaChang, JunleiYang, KelaierYiu, KaihangChen, Cong","Su MHou YCai SLi WWei YWang RWu MLiu MChang JYang KYiu KChen CAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9076-3148","Department of Cardiology, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China.Institute of Biomedicine and Biotechnology, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China.Department of Otorhinolaryngology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.Department of Cardiology, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China.Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.Department of Cardiology, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China.Department of Cardiology, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China.Department of Cardiology, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China.Department of Cardiology, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China.Institute of Biomedicine and Biotechnology, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen, China.Department of Cardiology, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China. khkyiu@hku.hk.Department of Cardiology, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China. khkyiu@hku.hk.Department of Cardiology, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, China. chenc6@hku-szh.org.","eng","No.82270400/National Nature Scientific Foundation of China/No.82300457/National Nature Scientific Foundation of China/No.YCYJ20220530142410023/Shenzhen City Nature Scientific Foundation/No.2022A1515110881/Guangdong Province Nature Scientific Foundation/No.2023A1515010731/Guangdong Province Nature Scientific Foundation/No.RCBS20221008093335085/Shenzhen City Technology Innovation Talents Development/No.RCBS20221008093102010/Shenzhen City Technology Innovation Talents Development/","Journal Article","20240227","Germany","Diabetologia","Diabetologia","0006777","0 (Integrin alpha1)0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Humans*Heart Failure/complicationsVentricular Function, LeftStroke VolumeIntegrin alpha1*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complicationsProteomicsBiomarkers","PMC10954979",NA,"NOTNLM","Cardiac remodellingEchocardiographyHFpEFHeart failure with preserved ejection fractionITGA1Plasma integrin α1Type 2 diabetes",NA,"2024/02/28 00:43","2024/03/21 12:44","2024/02/27","2024/02/27 23:15","2023/10/18 00:00 [received]2024/01/04 00:00 [accepted]2024/03/21 12:44 [medline]2024/02/28 00:43 [pubmed]2024/02/27 23:15 [entrez]2024/02/27 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1007/s00125-024-06109-4 [pii]6109 [pii]10.1007/s00125-024-06109-4 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetologia. 2024 May;67(5):850-863. doi: 10.1007/s00125-024-06109-4.

GDM is considered a high-risk state which may lead to type II diabetes which is associated with an increase in a number of interrelated adverse perinatal outcomes. Given the fact that the progress of a successful pregnancy is dependent on the intricate communication between several biological molecules, identification of the proteomic profile perturbations in women with GDM is expected to help in understanding the disease pathogenesis and also discovery of clinical biomarker(s). In recent years, both gel-free and gel-based proteomics have been extensively investigated for improving maternal and child health. Although there are several reports integrating various aspects of proteomics in pregnancy related diseases such as preeclampsia, extensive Pubmed search shows no review so far on the application of proteomics in gestational diabetes. In this review, we focus on various high-throughput proteomic technologies for the identification of unique biosignatures and biomarkers responsible for the early prediction of GDM. Further, different analytical strategies and biological samples involved in proteomic analysis of this pregnancy-related disease are discussed.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteomics in India.","Singh, ApoorvaSubramani, ElavarasanDatta Ray, ChaitaliRapole, SrikanthChaudhury, Koel","Singh ASubramani EDatta Ray CRapole SChaudhury K","School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India.School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India.Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education & Research, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.Proteomics Lab, National Centre for Cell Science, Ganesh khind, Pune, Maharashtra, India.School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of its significant microvascular complications, associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this article is to review the literature regarding the latest advances in the management of type 2 DM (T2DM) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We initially refer to the screening guidelines, the diagnostic tests used, the need for novel biomarkers in DN, the recent advances in high-risk patient identification, the recommended glycemic targets, and concerns regarding the accuracy of HbA1c in these patients. Then, a detailed explanation of the appropriate medical management based on evidence from recent trials is presented, analyzed, and discussed. All patients with T2DM should be screened for albuminuria at initial diagnosis and annually thereafter. Proteomics and metabolomics today represent promising diagnostic tools. Optimal glycemic control, with individualized HbA1c targets, is fundamental for reduced onset or delayed progression of DN and microvascular complications, in general. This can be enhanced by lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions when needed. Metformin represents the first pharmacological step, with, recently, a broadened indication for patients with impaired renal function. If HbA1c remains above the target in patients with established CKD, SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA are the preferred second-line agents, as introduced in all new guidelines. This change was the result of recent landmark trials that highlighted the superiority of the two aforementioned medication categories in terms of both renal and cardiovascular outcomes.","Kleinaki, ZoiKapnisi, StellaTheodorelou-Charitou, Sofia-AndrianiNikas, Ilias PPaschou, Stavroula A","Kleinaki ZKapnisi STheodorelou-Charitou SANikas IPPaschou SAAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-0651-1376","School of Medicine, European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.School of Medicine, European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.School of Medicine, European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.School of Medicine, European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus.School of Medicine, European University Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus. s.a.paschou@gmail.com.Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, ""Aghia Sophia"" Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece. s.a.paschou@gmail.com.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleReview","20200604","Switzerland","Hormones (Athens)","Hormones (Athens, Greece)","101142469","0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)0 (Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors)9100L32L2N (Metformin)0 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists)","IM","*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/diagnosis/therapy*Diabetic Nephropathies/diagnosis/etiology/therapyHumansHypoglycemic Agents/*therapeutic useMetformin/*therapeutic use*Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/diagnosis/etiology/therapySodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/*therapeutic use*Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","Chronic kidney diseaseDiabetes managementDiabetes mellitusDiabetic nephropathyRenal disease",NA,"2020/06/06 06:00","2021/09/23 06:00",NA,"2020/06/06 06:00","2020/02/23 00:00 [received]2020/05/14 00:00 [accepted]2020/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]2021/09/23 06:00 [medline]2020/06/06 06:00 [entrez]","10.1007/s42000-020-00212-y [pii]10.1007/s42000-020-00212-y [doi]","ppublish","Hormones (Athens). 2020 Dec;19(4):467-476. doi: 10.1007/s42000-020-00212-y.

Accumulating evidence indicates a connection between these two diseases at the molecular level. Much of what we currently know about T2D and AD is derived from in vivo and in vitro studies. However, further research and characterization of molecules is necessary to establish a strong connection between T2D and AD. In silico studies play a major role in finding non-evident patterns of gene expression and gene network connectivity. In this review, we give a brief introduction to T2D and AD and then describe the risk factors and molecules that are commonly associated with these diseases. Finally, we discuss the future directions and applications of bioinformatics that can provide greater insight into the relationship between these two diseases. Analysis and integration of high-throughput data on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics from normal and disease tissues would be very useful to improve our understanding of the mechanism behind disease initiation and the connection between these two diseases.

METHODS: Clinically cognitively normal T2DM individuals were recruited (NCT04455867). Depressive symptom severity was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; total scores ≤13 indicated minimal depressive symptoms and ≥ 14 indicated significant depressive symptoms). Executive function and verbal memory were assessed. Fasting serum oxylipins were quantified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. RESULTS: The study included 85 participants with minimal depressive symptoms and 27 with significant symptoms (mean age: 63.3 ± 9.8 years, 49 % women). In all participants, higher concentrations of linoleic acid derived sEH (12,13-dihydroxyoctadecamonoenoic acid; DiHOME) and CYP450 (12(13)-epoxyoctadecamonoenoic acid; EpOME) metabolites were associated with poorer executive function (F(1,101) = 6.094, p = 0.015 and F(1,101) = 5.598, p = 0.020, respectively). Concentrations of multiple sEH substrates interacted with depressive symptoms to predict 1) poorer executive function, including 9(10)-EpOME (F(1,100) = 12.137, p < 0.001), 5(6)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (5(6)-EpETrE; F(1,100) = 6.481, p = 0.012) and 11(12)-EpETrE (F(1,100) = 4.409, p = 0.038), and 2) verbal memory, including 9(10)-EpOME (F(1,100) = 4.286, p = 0.041), 5(6)-EpETrE (F(1,100) = 6.845, p = 0.010), 11(12)-EpETrE (F(1,100) = 3.981, p = 0.049) and 14(15)-EpETrE (F(1,100) = 5.019, p = 0.027).

There are several types of DM, but the most common are type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). DM is a complex disease and a global health concern, and the current clinical markers, such as fasting glucose, are helpful in the diagnosis of DM, but are not specific and sensitive, especially when measured on the beginning of the pathogenesis. Therefore, there is a pressing need to discover new early biomarkers that can provide an early diagnosis. Omics is an important field for the discovery of potential new biomarkers, especially proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics, where techniques such as liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance are utilized to identify novel DM biomarkers and their pathways. In this review, we report papers that applied omics in the context of DM to identify new markers and their relationship with this disease, with the aim of elucidating new diagnostic techniques for the main types of DM.","Soares, Nícia PedreiraMagalhaes, Gabriela CastroMayrink, Pedro HenriqueVerano-Braga, Thiago","Soares NPMagalhaes GCMayrink PHVerano-Braga T","National Institute of Science and Technology in Nanobiopharmaceutics (INCT-Nanobiofar), Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.Proteomics Group (NPF), Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.National Institute of Science and Technology in Nanobiopharmaceutics (INCT-Nanobiofar), Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.Proteomics Group (NPF), Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.National Institute of Science and Technology in Nanobiopharmaceutics (INCT-Nanobiofar), Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.Proteomics Group (NPF), Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.National Institute of Science and Technology in Nanobiopharmaceutics (INCT-Nanobiofar), Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil. tvbraga@ufmg.br.Proteomics Group (NPF), Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil. tvbraga@ufmg.br.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleReview",NA,"United States","Adv Exp Med Biol","Advances in experimental medicine and biology","0121103","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Humans*Lipidomics*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/diagnosis/geneticsProteomics/methodsMetabolomics/methodsBiomarkers",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","BiomarkersDiabetesMetabolomicsOmics approachesPathogenesisProteomics",NA,"2024/02/27 06:44","2024/02/28 06:44",NA,"2024/02/27 00:03","2024/02/28 06:44 [medline]2024/02/27 06:44 [pubmed]2024/02/27 00:03 [entrez]","10.1007/978-3-031-50624-6_11 [doi]","ppublish","Adv Exp Med Biol. 2024;1443:211-220. doi: 10.1007/978-3-031-50624-6_11.","© 2024.

However, the mechanism of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression in this high-risk group is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to identify novel biomarkers and potential causal proteins associated with DKD progression in patients with YT2D. METHODS: Among YT2D (T2D onset age <40 years), 144 DKD progressors (cases) were matched for T2D onset age, sex, and ethnicity with 292 nonprogressors (controls) and divided into discovery and validation sets. DKD progression was defined as decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 3 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater or 40% decline in eGFR from baseline. A total of 1472 plasma proteins were measured through a multiplex immunoassay that uses a proximity extension assay technology. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify proteins associated with DKD progression. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to evaluate causal relationship between plasma proteins and DKD progression. RESULTS: Forty-two plasma proteins were associated with DKD progression, independent of traditional cardiorenal risk factors, baseline eGFR, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. The proteins identified were related to inflammatory and remodeling biological processes. Our findings suggest angiogenin as one of the top signals (odds ratio = 5.29; 95% CI, 2.39-11.73; P = 4.03 × 10-5). Furthermore, genetically determined plasma angiogenin level was associated with increased odds of DKD progression. CONCLUSION: Large-scale proteomic analysis identified novel proteomic biomarkers for DKD progression in YT2D. Genetic evidence suggest a causal role of plasma angiogenin in DKD progression.","Gurung, Resham LalZheng, HuiliKoh, Hiromi Wai LingM, YiamunaaLiu, Jian-JunLiu, SylviaChan, ClaraAng, KevenTan, Clara Si HuaSobota, Radoslaw MikolajSubramaniam, TavintharanSum, Chee FangLim, Su Chi","Gurung RLAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8772-4452Zheng HKoh HWLM YLiu JJLiu SChan CAng KTan CSHSobota RMSubramaniam TSum CFLim SCAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-1742-5817","Clinical Research Unit, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore 768828.Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders Signature Research Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore 169857.Clinical Research Unit, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore 768828.Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore 138673.Clinical Research Unit, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore 768828.Clinical Research Unit, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore 768828.Clinical Research Unit, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore 768828.Clinical Research Unit, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore 768828.Clinical Research Unit, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore 768828.Clinical Research Unit, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore 768828.Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore 138673.Clinical Research Unit, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore 768828.Clinical Research Unit, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore 768828.Clinical Research Unit, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Singapore 768828.Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore 138673.Diabetes Centre, Admiralty Medical Centre, Singapore 730676.Saw Swee Hock School of Public Heath, Singapore 117549.Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 308232.","eng","STAR17201/This work was supported by the Alexandra Health Fund/NMRC RIE2020/Singapore National Medical Research Council/","Journal Article",NA,"United States","J Clin Endocrinol Metab","The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism","0375362","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Proteins)","IMCIN  J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2025 Jan 21;110(2):e544-e545. doi: 10.1210/clinem/dgae359.

We assessed the proteomic profiles to identify subtype specific biomarkers and its association with diabetes complications. METHODS: 1448 plasma proteins at baseline were measured and compared across the T2D subtypes. Multivariable cox regression was used to assess associations between significant proteomics features and cardio-renal complications. RESULTS: Among 645 T2D participants (SIRD-RII [19%], MOD [45%], MARD-II [36%]), 295 proteins expression differed significantly across the groups. These proteins were enriched in cell adhesion, neurogenesis and inflammatory response processes. In SIRD-RII group, ADH4, ACY1, THOP1, IGFBP2, NEFL, ENTPD2, CALB1, HAO1, CTSV, ITGAV, SCLY, EDA2R, ERBB2 proteins significantly associated with progressive CKD and LILRA5 protein with incident heart failure (HF). In MOD group, TAFA5, RSPO3, EDA2R proteins significantly associated with incident HF. In MARD-II group, FABP4 protein significantly associated with progressive CKD and PTPRN2 protein with major adverse cardiovascular events. Genetically determined NEFL and CALB1 were associated with kidney function decline.

The five primary tools used in this form of analysis are NMR spectrometry, HPLC, TLC-UV, GC-MS and LC-MS/MS, with MS as the most universal approach, particularly when used together with chromatographic separation and NMR. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is a rapidly growing problem with global consequences. The metabolomic approach has been extensively applied to examining T2DM, insulin resistance and obesity, not only to assess the development of the disease, but also to discover its potential biomarkers.

We hypothesize that the systemic metabolic and proteomic derangement observed in the progression of diabetes influences the composition of the aqueous humor (AH), which ultimately impacts the anterior segment health of the eye. To identify changes associated with diabetes progression, we mapped the metabolite profile and proteome of AH samples from patients with varying severities of type II diabetes (T2DM). Patients were classified as nondiabetic (ND or control), non-insulin-dependent diabetic without advanced features of disease (NAD-ni), insulin-dependent diabetic without advanced features (NAD-i), or diabetic with advanced features (AD). AH samples collected from the anterior chamber during elective ophthalmic surgery were evaluated for metabolite and protein expression changes associated with diabetic severity via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. Metabolic and proteomic pathway analyses were conducted utilizing MetaboAnalyst 4.0 and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. A total of 14 control, 12 NAD-ni, 4 NAD-I, and 14 AD samples were included for analysis. Elevated levels of several branched amino acids (e.g., valine, leucine, isoleucine), and lipid metabolites (e.g., palmitate) were found only with increasing diabetic severity (i.e., the AD group). Similar proteomic trends were noted in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism and the unfolded protein/stress response. These results represent the first report of both metabolomic and proteomic evaluation of aqueous humor. Diabetes results in metabolic and proteomic perturbations detectable in the AH, and unique changes become manifest as T2DM severity worsens. Changes in AH composition may serve as an indicator of disease severity, risk assessment of anterior segment cells and structures, and potential future therapies.","Fortenbach, Christopher RSkeie, Jessica MSevcik, Kristina MJohnson, A TimOetting, Thomas AHaugsdal, Jaclyn MSales, Christopher SNishimura, Darryl YTaylor, Eric BSchmidt, Gregory AGreiner, Mark A","Fortenbach CRAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2659-8971Skeie JMSevcik KMJohnson ATOetting TAHaugsdal JMSales CSNishimura DYTaylor EBSchmidt GAGreiner MAAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7170-6655","Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States of America.Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States of America.Iowa Lions Eye Bank, Coralville, IA, United States of America.Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States of America.Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States of America.Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States of America.Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States of America.Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States of America.Iowa Lions Eye Bank, Coralville, IA, United States of America.Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States of America.Iowa Lions Eye Bank, Coralville, IA, United States of America.Department of Biochemistry, Fraternal Order of the Eagles Diabetes Research Center, Abboud Cardiovascular Research Center, Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Pappajohn Biomedical Institute, University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA, United States of America.Iowa Lions Eye Bank, Coralville, IA, United States of America.Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States of America.Iowa Lions Eye Bank, Coralville, IA, United States of America.","eng","P30 DK054759/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR01 DK104998/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States","Journal Article","20230118","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0U46U6E8UK (NAD)","IM","Humans*Aqueous Humor/metabolism*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolismProteomicsNAD/metabolismChromatography, Liquid","PMC9847982",NA,NA,NA,"The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2023/01/19 06:00","2023/01/21 06:00","2023/01/18","2023/01/18 13:53","2022/06/20 00:00 [received]2022/12/29 00:00 [accepted]2023/01/18 13:53 [entrez]2023/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]2023/01/21 06:00 [medline]2023/01/18 00:00 [pmc-release]","PONE-D-22-17547 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0280491 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2023 Jan 18;18(1):e0280491. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0280491. eCollection 2023.","Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

We review recent advances in high-throughput technologies that provide comprehensive, scalable profiling of the plasma proteome with the potential to improve prediction and mechanistic understanding of type 2 diabetes (T2D). RECENT FINDINGS: Technological and analytical advancements have enabled identification of novel protein biomarkers and signatures that help to address challenges of existing approaches to predict and screen for T2D. Genetic studies have so far revealed putative causal roles for only few of the proteins that have been linked to T2D, but ongoing large-scale genetic studies of the plasma proteome will help to address this and increase our understanding of aetiological pathways and mechanisms leading to diabetes. Studies of the human plasma proteome have started to elucidate its potential for T2D prediction and biomarker discovery. Future studies integrating genomic and proteomic data will provide opportunities to prioritise drug targets and identify pathways linking genetic predisposition to T2D development.","Zanini, Julia CarrascoPietzner, MaikLangenberg, Claudia","Zanini JCPietzner MLangenberg CAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5017-7344","MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.

In the present study, we investigated the association between serum melatonin and type 2 diabetes risk in a southern Chinese population in a case-control study. We also examined the role of gut microbiota in this relationship. METHODS: Individuals with type 2 diabetes (cases) and healthy individuals (controls) (n=2034) were recruited from a cross-sectional study and were matched for age and sex in a case-control study. The levels of serum melatonin were measured and the association between serum melatonin and type 2 diabetes risk was examined using a multivariable logistic regression model. We further conducted a rigorously matched case-control study (n=120) in which gut microbial 16S rRNA was sequenced and metabolites were profiled using an untargeted LC-MS/MS approach. RESULTS: Higher levels of serum melatonin were significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (OR 0.82 [95% CI 0.74, 0.92]) and with lower levels of fasting glucose after adjustment for covariates (β -0.25 [95% CI -0.38, -0.12]). Gut microbiota exhibited alteration in the individuals with type 2 diabetes, in whom lower levels of serum melatonin, lower α and β-diversity of gut microbiota (p<0.05), greater abundance of Bifidobacterium and lower abundance of Coprococcus (linear discriminant analysis [LDA] >2.0) were found. Seven genera were correlated with melatonin and type 2 diabetes-related traits; among them Bifidobacterium was positively correlated with serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IL-10, whereas Coprococcus was negatively correlated with serum IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α and LPS (Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted p value [false discovery rate (FDR)] <0.05). Moreover, altered metabolites were detected in the participants with type 2 diabetes and there was a significant correlation between tryptophan (Trp) metabolites and the melatonin-correlated genera including Bifidobacterium and Coprococcus (FDR<0.05). Similarly, a significant correlation was found between Trp metabolites and inflammation factors, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNF-α and LPS (FDR<0.05). Further, we showed that Trp metabolites may serve as a biomarker to predict type 2 diabetes status (AUC=0.804). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A higher level of serum melatonin was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Gut microbiota-mediated melatonin signalling was involved in this association; especially, Bifidobacterium and Coprococcus-mediated Trp metabolites may be involved in the process. These findings uncover the importance of melatonin and melatonin-related bacteria and metabolites as potential therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes.","Huang, XueranQiu, YangGao, YongfenZhou,

We investigated whether aptamer-based proteomic profiling could identify biomarkers associated with future development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) beyond known risk factors. We identified dozens of markers with highly significant associations with future T2DM across 2 large longitudinal cohorts (n = 2839) followed for up to 16 years. We leveraged proteomic, metabolomic, genetic, and clinical data from humans to nominate 1 specific candidate to test for potential causal relationships in model systems. Our studies identified functional effects of aminoacylase 1 (ACY1), a top protein association with future T2DM risk, on amino acid metabolism and insulin homeostasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, a loss-of-function variant associated with circulating levels of the biomarker WAP, Kazal, immunoglobulin, Kunitz, and NTR domain-containing protein 2 (WFIKKN2) was, in turn, associated with fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and HOMA-IR measurements in humans. In addition to identifying potentially novel disease markers and pathways in T2DM, we provide publicly available data to be leveraged for insights about gene function and disease pathogenesis in the context of human metabolism.","Ngo, DebbyBenson, Mark DLong, Jonathan ZChen, Zsu-ZsuWang, RuiqiNath, Anjali KKeyes, Michelle JShen, DongxiaoSinha, SumitaKuhn, EricMorningstar, Jordan EShi, XuPeterson, Bennet DChan, ChristopherKatz, Daniel HTahir, Usman AFarrell, Laurie AMelander, OlleMosley, Jonathan DCarr, Steven AVasan, Ramachandran SLarson, Martin GSmith, J GustavWang, Thomas JYang, QiongGerszten, Robert E","Ngo DBenson MDLong JZChen ZZWang RNath AKKeyes MJShen DSinha SKuhn EMorningstar JEShi XPeterson BDChan CKatz DHTahir UAFarrell LAMelander OMosley JDCarr SAVasan RSLarson MGSmith JGWang TJYang QGerszten RE","Cardiovascular Institute.Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, and.Cardiovascular Institute.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston, Massachusetts, USA.Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.Cardiovascular Institute.Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, BIDMC, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.Cardiovascular Institute.Cardiovascular Institute.Cardiovascular Institute.Cardiovascular Institute.Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.Cardiovascular Institute.Cardiovascular Institute.Cardiovascular Institute.Cardiovascular Institute.Cardiovascular Institute.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston, Massachusetts, USA.Cardiovascular Institute.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston, Massachusetts, USA.Cardiovascular Institute.Department of Cardiology, Clinical Sciences, Lund University and Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.Departments of Medicine and Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.Department of Medicine, Divisions of Preventive Medicine and Cardiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Framingham Heart Study, Framingham, Massachusetts, USA.Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Framingham Heart Study, Framingham, Massachusetts, USA.Department of Cardiology, Clinical Sciences, Lund University and Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.Wallenberg Center for Molecular Medicine and Diabetes Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.Department of Cardiology and Wallenberg Laboratory, Gothenburg University and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.Department of Medicine, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, BIDMC, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.Cardiovascular Institute.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston, Massachusetts, USA.Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.","eng","P30 DK040561/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR01 DK124265/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesHHSN268201500001C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 DK081572/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesU24 CA210986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesT32 HL007208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesK01 GM103817/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United StatesHHSN268201500001I/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL132320/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL133870/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesN01HC25195/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States75N92019D00031/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesK08 HL145095/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20210308","United States","JCI Insight","JCI insight","101676073","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Proteome)","IM","AnimalsBiomarkers/*metabolismCohort Studies*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology/metabolismFemaleHumansMaleMice, Inbred C57BLMiddle AgedProteome/*metabolismRisk FactorsSignal TransductionMice","PMC8021115",NA,"NOTNLM","DiabetesEndocrinologyProteomics","Conflict of interest: The authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists.","2021/02/17 06:00","2022/01/11 06:00","2021/03/08","2021/02/16 17:10","2020/09/17 00:00 [received]2021/01/28 00:00 [accepted]2021/02/17 06:00 [pubmed]2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]2021/02/16 17:10 [entrez]2021/03/08 00:00 [pmc-release]","144392 [pii]10.1172/jci.insight.144392 [doi]","epublish","JCI Insight. 2021 Mar 8;6(5):e144392. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.144392.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1172/jci.insight.144392","144392",2021

Given the high risk of progressive renal function loss and end-stage renal disease, early identification of patients with a renal risk is important. Novel biomarkers may aid in improving renal risk stratification. In this review, we first focus on the classical panel of albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate as the primary clinical predictors of renal disease and then move our attention to novel biomarkers, primarily concentrating on assay-based multiple/panel biomarkers, proteomics biomarkers and metabolomics biomarkers. We focus on multiple biomarker panels since the molecular processes of renal disease progression in type 2 diabetes are heterogeneous, rendering it unlikely that a single biomarker significantly adds to clinical risk prediction. A limited number of prospective studies of multiple biomarkers address the predictive performance of novel biomarker panels in addition to the classical panel in type 2 diabetes. However, the prospective studies conducted so far have small sample sizes, are insufficiently powered and lack external validation. Adequately sized validation studies of multiple biomarker panels are thus required. There is also a paucity of studies that assess the effect of treatments on novel biomarker panels and determine whether initial treatment-induced changes in novel biomarkers predict changes in long-term renal outcomes. Such studies can not only improve our healthcare but also our understanding of the mechanisms of actions of existing and novel drugs and may yield biomarkers that can be used to monitor drug response. We conclude that this will be an area to focus research on in the future.","Pena, Michelle Jde Zeeuw, DickMischak, HaraldJankowski, JoachimOberbauer, RainerWoloszczuk, WolfgangBenner, JacquelineDallmann, GuidoMayer, BerndMayer, GertRossing, PeterLambers Heerspink, Hiddo J","Pena MJde Zeeuw DMischak HJankowski JOberbauer RWoloszczuk WBenner JDallmann GMayer BMayer GRossing PLambers Heerspink HJ","Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.BHF Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Center, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH, Hannover, Germany.University Hospital RWTH, Institute for Molecular Cardiovascular Research, Aachen, Germany.Section for Clinical Biometrics, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria KH Elisabethinen Linz and Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.Biomarker Design Forschungs GmbH, Vienna, Austria.Biomarker Design Forschungs GmbH, Vienna, Austria.Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria.emergentec biodevelopment GmbH, Vienna, Austria.Department of Internal Medicine IV (Nephrology and Hypertension), Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.Steno Diabetes Center, Gentofte, Denmark University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tReview",NA,"England","Nephrol Dial Transplant","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association  European Renal Association","8706402","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Biomarkers/*metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*diagnosis/metabolismDisease ProgressionHumansPrognosisRenal Insufficiency, Chronic/*diagnosis/metabolism",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","CKDbiomarker panelsmetabolomicsnovel biomarkersproteomics",NA,"2015/07/26 06:00","2016/03/25 06:00",NA,"2015/07/26 06:00","2015/07/26 06:00 [entrez]2015/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]","gfv252 [pii]10.1093/ndt/gfv252 [doi]","ppublish","Nephrol Dial Transplant. 2015 Aug;30 Suppl 4:iv86-95. doi: 10.1093/ndt/gfv252.","© The Author 2015.

However, it remains unclear whether the therapeutic effect of metformin in T2DM is related to the modulation of TRP metabolic pathway. This study aims to investigate whether metformin affects TRP metabolism in T2DM mice through the gut microbiota. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was established to determine 16 TRP metabolites in the serum, colon content, urine, and feces of T2DM mice, and the correlations between metabolites and the T2DM mice gut microbiota were performed. The method demonstrated acceptable linearity (R(2) > 0.996), with the limit of quantification ranging from 0.29 to 69.444 nmol/L for 16 analytes, and the limit of detection ranging from 0.087 to 20.833 nmol/L. In T2DM mice, metformin treatment effectively restored levels of indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), and the ILA/IPA ratio, along with several aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands in the serum, with a notable impact in the colon but not in the urine. This restoration was accompanied by a shift in the relative abundance of Dubosiella, Turicibacter, RF39, Clostridia_UCG-014, and Alistipes. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed positive correlations between Turicibacter and Alistipes with IPA and indole-3-acetic acid. Conversely, these genera displayed negative correlations with ILA and kynurenine. In addition, our study revealed the presence of endogenous indole pathway in germ-free mice, and the impact of metformin on endogenous TRP metabolism in T2DM mice cannot be disregarded. Further research is needed to investigate the regulation of TRP metabolism by metformin. IMPORTANCE: This study provides valuable insights into the interrelationship between metformin administration, changes in the tryptophan (TRP) metabolome, and gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. Indole-3-lactic acid (ILA)/indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) emerges as a potential biomarker for the development of T2DM and prediction of therapeutic response. While the indole metabolic pathway has long been associated exclusively with the gut microbiome, recent research has demonstrated the ability of host interleukin-4-induced-1 to metabolize TRP. The detection of indole derivatives in the serum of germ-free mice suggests the existence of inherent endogenous indole metabolic pathways. These findings deepen our understanding of metformin's efficacy in correcting TRP metabolic disorders and provide valuable directions for further investigation. Moreover, this knowledge may pave the way for the development of targeted treatment strategies for T2DM, focusing on the gut microbiome and restoration of associated TRP metabolism.","Xie, YvhaoLi, XinxinMeng, QingshiLi, JinjunWang, XinZhu, LiyingWang, WeiweiLi, Xiaoqiong","Xie YLi XMeng QLi JWang XZhu LWang WAUID ORCID: 0009-0005-1687-5981Li XAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5139-2057","College of Animal Science, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China.State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products & Food Sciences Institute, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, China.College of Animal Science, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China.State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products & Food Sciences Institute, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, China.State Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition, Institute of Animal Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products & Food Sciences Institute, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, China.State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products & Food Sciences Institute, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, China.State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products & Food Sciences Institute, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, China.College of Animal Science, Shanxi Agricultural University, Taigu, China.State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products & Food Sciences Institute, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, China.","eng","32000079/MOST | National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)/LQ20C200009/MOST | NSFC | NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Fund | | Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (ZJNSF)/2021DG700024-KF202209/State key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products/","Journal Article","20240820","United States","Microbiol Spectr","Microbiology spectrum","101634614","9100L32L2N (Metformin)8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)0 (Indoles)5SW11R7M7M (indole-3-lactic acid)0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)830-96-6 (indolepropionic acid)0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Animals*Metformin/pharmacology/therapeutic use*Tryptophan/metabolism*Gastrointestinal Microbiome/drug effects*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolism/drug therapy/microbiologyMice*Indoles/metabolismMaleFeces/microbiology/chemistryMice, Inbred C57BLHypoglycemic Agents/therapeutic use/pharmacologyChromatography, LiquidBacteria/classification/metabolism/drug effectsBiomarkers/blood/urine/metabolism","PMC11448047",NA,"NOTNLM","LC-MS/MSgut microbiotaindole-3-lactic acidindole-3-propionic acidmetformintryptophan metabolismtype 2 diabetes mellitus","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","2024/08/20 12:43","2024/10/04 08:43","2024/08/20","2024/08/20 09:14","2024/10/04 08:43 [medline]2024/08/20 12:43 [pubmed]2024/08/20 09:14 [entrez]2024/08/20 00:00 [pmc-release]","spectrum00291-24 [pii]spectrum.00291-24 [pii]10.1128/spectrum.00291-24 [doi]","ppublish","Microbiol Spectr. 2024 Oct 3;12(10):e0029124. doi: 10.1128/spectrum.00291-24.

However, it remains unknown whether plasma metabolomic profiles related to proinflammatory/hyperinsulinaemic diets and to inflammatory/insulin biomarkers are associated with type 2 diabetes risk. METHODS: We analysed 6840 participants from the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study to identify the plasma metabolome related to empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP), empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH), four circulating inflammatory biomarkers and C-peptide. Dietary intakes were assessed using validated food frequency questionnaires. Plasma metabolomic profiling was conducted by LC-MS/MS. Metabolomic signatures were derived using elastic net regression. Multivariable Cox regression was used to examine associations of the metabolomic profiles with type 2 diabetes risk. RESULTS: We identified 27 metabolites commonly associated with both EDIP and inflammatory biomarker z score and 21 commonly associated with both EDIH and C-peptide. Higher metabolomic dietary inflammatory potential (MDIP), reflecting higher metabolic potential of both an inflammatory dietary pattern and circulating inflammatory biomarkers, was associated with higher type 2 diabetes risk. The HR comparing highest vs lowest quartiles of MDIP was 3.26 (95% CI 2.39, 4.44). We observed a strong positive association with type 2 diabetes risk for the metabolomic signature associated with EDIP-only (HR 3.75; 95% CI 2.71, 5.17) or inflammatory biomarkers-only (HR 4.07; 95% CI 2.91, 5.69). In addition, higher metabolomic dietary index for hyperinsulinaemia (MDIH), reflecting higher metabolic potential of both an insulinaemic dietary pattern and circulating C-peptide, was associated with greater type 2 diabetes risk (HR 3.00; 95% CI 2.22, 4.06); further associations with type 2 diabetes were HR 2.79 (95% CI 2.07, 3.76) for EDIH-only signature and HR 3.89 (95% CI 2.82, 5.35) for C-peptide-only signature. The diet scores were significantly associated with risk, although adjustment for the corresponding metabolomic signature scores attenuated the associations with type 2 diabetes, these remained significant. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The metabolomic signatures reflecting proinflammatory or hyperinsulinaemic diets and related biomarkers were positively associated with type 2 diabetes risk, supporting that these dietary patterns may influence type 2 diabetes risk via the regulation of metabolism.","Lee, Dong HoonJin, QiShi, NiWang, FengleiBever, Alaina MLiang, LimingHu, Frank BSong, MingyangZeleznik, Oana AZhang, XuehongJoshi, AmitWu, KanaJeon, Justin YMeyerhardt, Jeffrey AChan, Andrew TEliassen, A HeatherClish, ClaryClinton, Steven KGiovannucci, Edward LLi, JunTabung, Fred K","Lee DHJin QShi NWang FBever AMLiang LHu FBSong MZeleznik OAZhang XJoshi AWu KJeon JYMeyerhardt JAChan ATEliassen AHClish CClinton SKGiovannucci ELLi JTabung FK","Department of Sport Industry Studies, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.Department of Nutrition, Harvard T.H.

Recently, it has been found that finerenone, a novel nonsteroidal selective MR antagonist, can robustly improve cardiorenal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and a wide spectrum of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the mechanisms underlying the cardiorenal benefits of finerenone are poorly understood. Further, whether the clinical benefits are mediated by an improvement in vascular stiffness is not confirmed. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate the effects of finerenone on vascular stiffness as assessed using cardio ankle vascular index (CAVI) and relevant cardiorenal biomarkers in patients with T2D and CKD. METHODS: The Effects of Finerenone on Vascular Stiffness and Cardiorenal Biomarkers in Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease (FIVE-STAR) is an ongoing, investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial in Japan. Its target sample size is 100 subjects. Recruitment will be performed from September 2023 to July 2024. After obtaining informed consent, eligible participants with T2D and CKD (25 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ≤ estimated glomerular filtration ratio [eGFR] < 90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and 30 mg/g Cr ≤ urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] < 3500 mg/g Cr) will be equally randomized to receive 24-week treatment with either finerenone (starting dose at 10 mg once daily in participants with a baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or at 20 mg once daily in those with a baseline eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) or dose-matched placebo. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in CAVI at 24 weeks. The secondary endpoints are changes from baseline in UACR at 12 and 24 weeks and relevant serum and urinary biomarkers at 24 weeks. As an exploratory endpoint, proteomic analysis using the Olink® Target 96 panels will be also performed. DISCUSSION: FIVE-STAR is the first trial evaluating the therapeutic impact of finerenone on vascular stiffness and relevant cardiorenal biomarkers in patients with T2D and CKD. This study will provide mechanistic insights on the clinical benefits of finerenone based on recent cardiovascular and renal outcome trials.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the progressive failure of β-cells to respond to glucose in type-2 diabetes remain unresolved. Using a combination of transcriptomics and proteomics, we find significant dysregulation of major metabolic pathways in islets of diabetic βV59M mice, a non-obese, eulipidaemic diabetes model. Multiple genes/proteins involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis are upregulated, whereas those involved in oxidative phosphorylation are downregulated. In isolated islets, glucose-induced increases in NADH and ATP are impaired and both oxidative and glycolytic glucose metabolism are reduced. INS-1 β-cells cultured chronically at high glucose show similar changes in protein expression and reduced glucose-stimulated oxygen consumption: targeted metabolomics reveals impaired metabolism. These data indicate hyperglycaemia induces metabolic changes in β-cells that markedly reduce mitochondrial metabolism and ATP synthesis.

While most efforts are centered on using blood samples for biomarker discovery, the use of saliva remains underexplored. METHODS: Using noninvasive saliva samples from 2974 Qatari subjects, we analyzed the microbial communities from diabetic, pre-diabetic, and non-diabetic participants based on their HbA1C levels. The salivary microbiota was assessed in all subjects by sequencing the V1-V3 regions of 16S rRNA gene. For the proteomics profiling, we randomly selected 50 gender and age-matched non-diabetic and diabetic subjects and compared their proteome with SOMAscan. Microbiota and proteome profiles were then integrated to reveal candidate biomarkers for T2D. RESULTS: Our results indicate that the salivary microbiota of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals differs significantly from that of non-diabetic subjects. Specifically, a significant increase in the abundance of Campylobacter, Dorea, and Bacteroidales was observed in the diabetic subjects compared to their non-diabetic controls. Metabolic pathway prediction analysis for these bacteria revealed a significant overrepresentation of genes associated with fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis, as well as aromatic amino acid metabolism in the diabetic group. Additionally, we observed distinct differences in salivary proteomic profiles between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Notably, levels of Haptoglobin, Plexin-C1, and MCL-1 were elevated, while Osteopontin (SPP1), Histone1H3A (HIST3H2A), and Histone H1.2 were reduced in diabetic individuals. Furthermore, integrated correlation analysis of salivary proteome and microbiota data demonstrated a strong positive correlation between HIST1H3A and HIST3H2A with Porphyromonas sp., all of which were decreased in the diabetic group. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to assess the salivary microbiota in T2D patients from a large cohort of the Qatari population. We found significant differences in the salivary microbiota of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals compared to non-diabetic controls. Our study is also the first to assess the salivary proteome using SOMAScan in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Integration of the microbiota and proteome profiles revealed a unique signature for T2D that can be used as potential T2D biomarkers.","Murugesan, SelvasankarYousif, GhadaDjekidel, Mohamed NadhirGentilcore, GiusyGrivel, Jean CharlesAl Khodor, Souhaila","Murugesan SYousif GDjekidel MNGentilcore GGrivel JCAl Khodor SAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4858-7130","Research Department, Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar.Research Department, Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar.Research Department, Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar.Research Department, Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar.Research Department, Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar.Research Department, Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar. salkhodor@sidra.org.","eng","PPM2-0216-170012/Qatar National Research Fund/","Journal Article","20241220","England","J Transl Med","Journal of translational medicine","101190741","0 (Proteome)0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Humans*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/microbiology/metabolism/blood*Proteomics*Saliva/microbiology/metabolismMaleFemale*ArabsMiddle AgedProteome/metabolismMicrobiota/geneticsAdultBiomarkers/metabolism/bloodCase-Control Studies","PMC11662572",NA,"NOTNLM","16S ribosomal RNADiabetesQatar BiobankQatari populationSaliva","Declarations.

It was shown that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, a novel yet already widely used therapy, may prevent the development of DKD and alter its natural progression. SGLT2 inhibitors induce systemic and glomerular hemodynamic changes, provide metabolic advantages, and reduce inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. In T2DM patients, regardless of cardiovascular diseases, SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce albuminuria, progression of DKD, and doubling of serum creatinine levels, thus lowering the need for kidney replacement therapy by over 40%. The molecular mechanisms behind these beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors extend beyond their glucose-lowering effects. The emerging studies are trying to explain these mechanisms at the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels.","Klen, JasnaDolžan, Vita","Klen JDolžan VAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6707-6649","Division of Surgery, Department of Abdominal Surgery, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.","eng","P1-0170/Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS (Eng.

We hypothesized that hypoglycaemia-induced amyloid-related protein changes would be exacerbated in T2D. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, parallel study in T2D (n = 23) and controls (n = 23). Subjects underwent insulin-induced hypoglycaemia with blood sampling at baseline, hypoglycaemia and post-hypoglycaemia; proteomic analysis of amyloid-related proteins was undertaken. RESULTS: At baseline, amyloid-precursor protein (APP) (P < .01) was elevated and alpha-synuclein (SNCA) (P < .01) reduced in T2D. At hypoglycaemia, amyloid P-component (P < .01) was elevated and SNCA (P < .05) reduced in T2D; APP (P < .01) and noggin (P < .05) were elevated and SNCA (P < .01) reduced in controls. In the post-hypoglycaemia follow-up period, APP and microtubule-associated protein tau normalized in controls but showed a below-baseline decrease in T2D; noggin normalized in both; SNCA normalized in T2D, with a below-baseline decrease in controls. CONCLUSION: The AD-associated protein pattern found in T2D, with basal elevated APP and reduced SNCA, was exaggerated by hypoglycaemia with increased APP and decreased SNCA. Additional AD-associated protein levels that changed in response to hypoglycaemia, particularly in T2D, included amyloid P-component, microtubule-associated protein tau, apolipoproteins A1 and E3, pappalysin and noggin. These results are in accordance with the reported detrimental effects of hypoglycaemia.","Moin, Abu Saleh MdAl-Qaissi, AhmedSathyapalan, ThozhukatAtkin, Stephen LButler, Alexandra E","Moin ASMAl-Qaissi ASathyapalan TAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3544-2231Atkin SLAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5887-7257Butler AEAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5762-3917","Diabetes Research Center (DRC), Qatar Biomedical Research Institute (QBRI), Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Qatar Foundation (QF), Doha, Qatar.Academic Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hull York Medical School, Hull, UK.Leeds Medical School, Leeds, UK.Academic Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hull York Medical School, Hull, UK.Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, Busaiteen, Bahrain.Diabetes Research Center (DRC), Qatar Biomedical Research Institute (QBRI), Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Qatar Foundation (QF), Doha, Qatar.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20201025","England","Diabetes Obes Metab","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","100883645","0 (Amyloidogenic Proteins)","IM","*Alzheimer DiseaseAmyloidogenic Proteins*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complicationsHumans*HypoglycemiaProspective StudiesProteomics",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","Alzheimer's diseaseamyloid-related proteinsdementiahypoglycaemiatype 2 diabetes",NA,"2020/10/08 06:00","2021/07/06 06:00",NA,"2020/10/07 08:42","2020/08/19 00:00 [received]2020/09/17 00:00 [revised]2020/10/04 00:00 [accepted]2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]2021/07/06 06:00 [medline]2020/10/07 08:42 [entrez]","10.1111/dom.14220 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes Obes Metab. 2021 Feb;23(2):338-349. doi: 10.1111/dom.14220.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of EC. Currently, no proteomic studies have investigated the role of diabetes in endometrial cancers from clinical samples. The present study aims to elucidate the molecular link between diabetes and EC using a proteomic approach. Endometrial tissue samples were obtained from age-matched patients (EC Diabetic and EC Non-Diabetic) during surgery. Untargeted proteomic analysis of the endometrial tissues was carried out using a two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF). A total of 53 proteins were identified, with a significant difference in abundance (analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, p ≤ 0.05; fold-change ≥ 1.5) between the two groups, among which 30 were upregulated and 23 downregulated in the EC Diabetic group compared to EC Non-Diabetic. The significantly upregulated proteins included peroxiredoxin-1, vinculin, endoplasmin, annexin A5, calreticulin, and serotransferrin. The significantly downregulated proteins were myosin regulatory light polypeptide 9, Retinol dehydrogenase 12, protein WWC3, intraflagellar transport protein 88 homolog, superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn], and retinal dehydrogenase 1. The network pathway was related to connective tissue disorder, developmental disorder, and hereditary disorder, with the identified proteins centered around dysregulation of ERK1/2 and F Actin signaling pathways. Cancer-associated protein alterations such as upregulation of peroxiredoxin-1, annexin 5, and iNOS, and downregulation of RDH12, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1, SOD1, and MYL 9, were found in the EC tissues of the diabetic group. Differential expression of proteins linked to cancer metastasis, such as the upregulation of vinculin and endoplasmin and downregulation of WWC3 and IFT88, was seen in the patients with diabetes. Calreticulin and alpha-enolase, which might have a role in the interplay between diabetes and EC, need further investigation.","Mujammami, MuhammadRafiullah, MohamedAlfadda, Assim AAkkour, KhalidAlanazi, Ibrahim OMasood, AfshanMusambil, MohthashAlhalal, HaniArafah, MariaRahman, Anas M AbdelBenabdelkamel, Hicham","Mujammami MRafiullah MAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-0583-3901Alfadda AAAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4792-5188Akkour KAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6302-5609Alanazi IOAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8479-7875Masood AAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8082-9326Musambil MAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2402-9628Alhalal HArafah MAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6847-5884Rahman AMAAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9527-9424Benabdelkamel HAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9745-2959","University Diabetes Center, King Saud University Medical City, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Strategic Center for Diabetes Research, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Strategic Center for Diabetes Research, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Proteomics Resource Unit, Obesity Research Center, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.The National Center for Biotechnology (NCB), Life Science and Environment Research Institute, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST), Riyadh 11442, Saudi Arabia.Proteomics Resource Unit, Obesity Research Center, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Proteomics Resource Unit, Obesity Research Center, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, King Saud University Medical City, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Metabolomics Section, Center for Genome Medicine, Department of Clinical Genomics, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSHRC), Riyadh 11211, Saudi Arabia.Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, Alfaisal University, Riyadh 11533, Saudi Arabia.Proteomics Resource Unit, Obesity Research Center, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.","eng","No. 08-MED513-02/National Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation (MAARIFAH), King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia/","Journal Article","20220328","Switzerland","Life (Basel)","Life (Basel, Switzerland)","101580444",NA,NA,NA,"PMC9030544",NA,"NOTNLM","2D-DIGEMALDI-TOFdiabetesendometrial cancerproteomicstissueuterus","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","2022/04/24 06:00","2022/04/24 06:01","2022/03/28","2022/04/23 01:05","2022/03/06 00:00 [received]2022/03/20 00:00 [revised]2022/03/25 00:00 [accepted]2022/04/23 01:05 [entrez]2022/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]2022/04/24 06:01 [medline]2022/03/28 00:00 [pmc-release]","life12040491 [pii]life-12-00491 [pii]10.3390/life12040491 [doi]","epublish","Life (Basel). 2022 Mar 28;12(4):491. doi: 10.3390/life12040491.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/life12040491",NA,2022

Some patients with the comorbidities of diabetes and other primary renal diseases have similar clinical features to DN, which is defined as non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD). It is necessary to distinguish between DN and NDRD, considering they differ in their pathological characteristics, treatment regimes, and prognosis. Renal biopsy provides a gold standard; however, it is difficult for this to be conducted in all patients. Therefore, it is necessary to discover non-invasive biomarkers that can distinguish between DN and NDRD. In this research, the urinary exosomes were isolated from the midstream morning urine based on ultracentrifugation combined with 0.22 μm membrane filtration. Data-independent acquisition-based quantitative proteomics were used to define the proteome profile of urinary exosomes from DN (n = 12) and NDRD (n = 15) patients diagnosed with renal biopsy and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients without renal damage (n = 9), as well as healthy people (n = 12). In each sample, 3372 ± 722.1 proteins were identified on average. We isolated 371 urinary exosome proteins that were significantly and differentially expressed between DN and NDRD patients, and bioinformatic analysis revealed them to be mainly enriched in the immune and metabolic pathways. The use of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression further identified phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase domain containing 1 (PHYHD1) as the differential diagnostic biomarker, the efficacy of which was verified with another cohort including eight DN patients, five NDRD patients, seven T2DM patients, and nine healthy people. Additionally, a concentration above 1.203 μg/L was established for DN based on the ELISA method. Furthermore, of the 19 significantly different expressed urinary exosome proteins selected by using the protein-protein interaction network and LASSO logistic regression, 13 of them were significantly related to clinical indicators that could reflect the level of renal function and hyperglycemic management.","Ding, XiaonanZhang, DongRen, QinqinHu, YilanWang, JifengHao, JingWang, HaoranZhao,

This defect is characterised by reduced secretion of glucagon and other counterregulatory hormones. Evidence indicates that glucose-responsive neurons located in the hypothalamus orchestrate the CRR. Here, we aimed to identify the changes in hypothalamic gene and protein expression that underlie impaired CRR in a mouse model of defective CRR. METHODS: High-fat-diet fed and low-dose streptozocin-treated C57BL/6N mice were exposed to one (acute hypoglycaemia [AH]) or multiple (recurrent hypoglycaemia [RH]) insulin-induced hypoglycaemic episodes and plasma glucagon levels were measured. Single-nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data were obtained from the hypothalamus and cortex of mice exposed to AH and RH. Proteomic data were obtained from hypothalamic synaptosomal fractions. RESULTS: The final insulin injection resulted in similar plasma glucose levels in the RH group and AH groups, but glucagon secretion was significantly lower in the RH group (AH: 94.5±9.2 ng/l [n=33]; RH: 59.0±4.8 ng/l [n=37]; p<0.001). Analysis of snRNA-seq data revealed similar proportions of hypothalamic cell subpopulations in the AH and RH-exposed mice. Changes in transcriptional profiles were found in all cell types analysed. In neurons from RH-exposed mice, we observed a significant decrease in expression of Avp, Pmch and Pcsk1n, and the most overexpressed gene was Kcnq1ot1, as compared with AH-exposed mice. Gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) indicated a coordinated decrease in many oxidative phosphorylation genes and reduced expression of vacuolar H(+) and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPases; these observations were in large part confirmed in the proteomic analysis of synaptosomal fractions. Compared with AH-exposed mice, oligodendrocytes from RH-exposed mice had major changes in gene expression that suggested reduced myelin formation. In astrocytes from RH-exposed mice, DEGs indicated reduced capacity for neurotransmitters scavenging in tripartite synapses as compared with astrocytes from AH-exposed mice. In addition, in neurons and astrocytes, multiple changes in gene expression suggested increased amyloid beta (Aβ) production and stability. The snRNA-seq analysis of the cortex showed that the adaptation to RH involved different biological processes from those seen in the hypothalamus. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present study provides a model of defective counterregulation in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. It shows that repeated hypoglycaemic episodes induce multiple defects affecting all hypothalamic cell types and their interactions, indicative of impaired neuronal network signalling and dysegulated hypoglycaemia sensing, and displaying features of neurodegenerative diseases. It also shows that repeated hypoglycaemia leads to specific molecular adaptation in the hypothalamus when compared with the cortex.

We identified 171 proteins differentially expressed in the STZ-treated groups, about 70 of which were documented as diabetes-related gene in previous studies. Pathway analyses indicated that the biological functions of differentially expressed proteins were related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, complements, and coagulation cascades. Expression change in tryptophan metabolism pathway was also found in this study which may be associations with diabetes.

RECENT FINDINGS: Although less frequently than in type 2 diabetes, DKD may develop also in nonproteinuric type 1 diabetes. However, the progression rate to kidney failure in nonproteinuric diabetic people is much lower than in proteinuric ones. A new proteomic biomarker, the chronic kidney disease (CKD)273, reliably predicts the risk of incident micro and macroalbuminuria and of CKD in nonalbuminuric diabetic people. SGLT2 inhibition markedly reduces albuminuria in macro and microalbuminuric patients and discernibly mitigates albumin excretion also in those with albuminuria in the normal range. SUMMARY: Studies focusing on risk factors for DKD in nonproteinuric patients are a clinical research priority. The CKD273 classifier is a promising biomarker for the early identification of nonproteinuric patients at high risk for progressive DKD. Empagliflozin and SGLT2 inhibitors may have a favorable impact on the progression of DKD in nonalbuminuric diabetic people, a hypothesis to be tested in specific clinical trials.","Zoccali, CarmineMallamaci, Francesca","Zoccali CMallamaci F","CNR National Research Council Clinical Epidemiology and Pathophysiology of Renal Disease and Hypertension Unit.CNR National Research Council Clinical Epidemiology and Pathophysiology of Renal Disease and Hypertension Unit.Renal and Transplantation Unit, Ospedali Riuniti, Reggio Calabria, Italy.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleReview",NA,"England","Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens","Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension","9303753","0 (Benzhydryl Compounds)0 (Glucosides)0 (Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors)HDC1R2M35U (empagliflozin)","IM","Albuminuria/prevention & controlBenzhydryl Compounds/therapeutic useDiabetic Nephropathies/*prevention & controlDisease ProgressionGlucosides/therapeutic useHumansProteomicsSodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/therapeutic use",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019/01/24 06:00","2020/03/03 06:00",NA,"2019/01/24 06:00","2019/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]2020/03/03 06:00 [medline]2019/01/24 06:00 [entrez]","10.1097/MNH.0000000000000489 [doi]","ppublish","Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens. 2019 May;28(3):227-232. doi: 10.1097/MNH.0000000000000489.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1097/MNH.0000000000000489",NA,2019

The pathogenesis of DPN is not fully known, but several pathways and gene polymorphisms contributing to DPN are described. DPN can be studied using nerve biopsies, but studies on the proteome of the nerve itself, and its surrounding tissue as a whole, are lacking. Studies on the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) have proposed PIN a useful indicator of DPN. METHODS: A quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis was made of peripheral nerves from age and gender-matched living human male tissue donors; nine type 2 diabetes subjects, with decreased sural nerve action potentials indicating DPN, and six controls without type 2 diabetes, with normal electrophysiology results. RESULTS: A total of 2617 proteins were identified. Linear regression was used to discover which proteins were differentially expressed between type 2 diabetes and controls. Only soft signals were found. Therefore, clustering of the 500 most variable proteins was made to find clusters of similar proteins in type 2 diabetes subjects and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study shows, for the first time, that the use of quantitative mass spectrometry enables quantification of proteins from nerve biopsies from subjects with and without type 2 diabetes, which may aid in finding biomarkers of importance to DPN development.","Ising, ErikÅhrman, EmmaThomsen, Niels O BEriksson, Karl-FredrikMalmström, JohanDahlin, Lars B","Ising EAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5116-1635Åhrman EThomsen NOBAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2522-4804Eriksson KFMalmström JAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2889-7169Dahlin LBAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-1334-3099","Department of Clinical Sciences  Pediatric Endocrinology, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.Department of Emergency and Internal Medicine, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden.Department of Clinical Sciences  Division of Infection Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.Department of Translational Medicine  Hand Surgery, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.Department of Hand Surgery, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden.Department of Emergency and Internal Medicine, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden.Department of Clinical Sciences  Division of Infection Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.Department of Translational Medicine  Hand Surgery, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.Department of Hand Surgery, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20210804","England","Diabet Med","Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association","8500858",NA,"IM","AgedDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications/epidemiologyDiabetic Neuropathies/epidemiology/*etiologyFemaleHumansIncidenceMalePeripheral Nerves/*physiopathologyProteomics/*methodsSweden/epidemiology",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","diabetes mellitusdiabetic neuropathiesperipheral neuropathiesproteometype 2",NA,"2021/07/27 06:00","2022/03/30 06:00",NA,"2021/07/26 09:02","2021/05/17 00:00 [received]2021/07/24 00:00 [accepted]2021/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]2022/03/30 06:00 [medline]2021/07/26 09:02 [entrez]","10.1111/dme.14658 [doi]","ppublish","Diabet Med. 2021 Nov;38(11):e14658. doi: 10.1111/dme.14658.

By using TMT-labeling coupled high-throughput mass spectrometry, we conducted a comprehensive plasma proteomic analysis in none-T2DM people (Ctrl, n = 30), and the age-/sex-matched T2DM patients with mild cognitive impairment (T2DM-MCI, n = 30) or T2DM without MCI (T2DM-nMCI, n = 25). The candidate biomarkers identified by proteomics and bioinformatics analyses were verified by ELISA, and their diagnostic capabilities were evaluated with machine learning. A total of 53 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in T2DM-MCI compared with T2DM-nMCI patients. These DEPs were significantly enriched in multiple biological processes, such as amyloid neuropathies, CNS disorders, and metabolic acidosis. Among the DEPs, alpha-1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1), major viral protein (PRNP), and valosin-containing protein (VCP) showed strong correlation with AD high-risk genes APP, MAPT, APOE, PSEN1, and PSEN2. Also, the levels of PP2A cancer inhibitor (CIP2A), PRNP, corticotropin-releasing factor-binding protein (CRHBP) were significantly increased, while the level of VCP was decreased in T2DM-MCI patients compared with that of the T2DM-nMCI, and these changes were correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Further machine learning data showed that increases in PRNP, CRHBP, VCP, and rGSK-3β(T/S9) (ratio of total to serine-9-phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β) had the greatest power to identify mild cognitive decline in T2DM patients.","Yu, HaitaoGao, YangHe, TingLi, MengzhuZhang, YaoZheng, JieJiang, BijunChen, ChongyangKe, DanLiu, YanchaoWang, Jian-Zhi","Yu HGao YHe TLi MZhang YZheng JJiang BChen CKe DLiu YWang JZ","Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of China/Hubei Province for Neurological Disorders, Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.Department of Basic Medicine, Wuxi School of Medicine, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China.Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of China/Hubei Province for Neurological Disorders, Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of China/Hubei Province for Neurological Disorders, Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.Department of Neurosurgery, Wuhan Central Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Neurological Disorders, Li Yuan Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.Key Laboratory of Basic Pharmacology of Ministry of Education, Joint International Research Laboratory of Ethnomedicine of Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Basic Pharmacology of Guizhou Province, Department of Pharmacology, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of China/Hubei Province for Neurological Disorders, Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of China/Hubei Province for Neurological Disorders, Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of China/Hubei Province for Neurological Disorders, Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.Department of Neurosurgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.Key Laboratory of Education Ministry of China/Hubei Province for Neurological Disorders, Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.Co-innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20221124","Switzerland","Front Cell Dev Biol","Frontiers in cell and developmental biology","101630250",NA,NA,NA,"PMC9729784",NA,"NOTNLM","Alzheimer’s diseasediagnostic biomarkersmild cognitive impairmentproteomicstype 2 diabetes","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","2022/12/13 06:00","2022/12/13 06:01","2022/01/01","2022/12/12 11:10","2021/11/19 00:00 [received]2022/11/03 00:00 [accepted]2022/12/12 11:10 [entrez]2022/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]2022/12/13 06:01 [medline]2022/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","818141 [pii]10.3389/fcell.2022.818141 [doi]","epublish","Front Cell Dev Biol. 2022 Nov 24;10:818141. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2022.818141. eCollection 2022.","Copyright © 2022 Yu, Gao, He, Li, Zhang, Zheng, Jiang, Chen, Ke, Liu and Wang.",NA,NA,"10.3389/fcell.2022.818141",NA,2022

This is also the first cause of diabetic complications. However, it is now generally accepted that glucotoxicity also participates in the worsening of type 2 diabetes, by affecting the secretion of beta-cells. So far, different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the adverse effects of chronic hyperglycaemia. One of them suggests that the modulation of expression of several key proteins during a hyperglycaemia state, may explain the toxic effect of glucotoxicity. Therefore, proteomic analysis of biological samples represents an interesting method to study the effect of chronic hyperglycaemia on protein expression. The discovery of new proteins for which the expression could be modulated by chronic hyperglycaemia may probably help to better understand the mechanisms underlying glucotoxicity. In this review, we will first present an introduction of the different mechanisms known to be involved in the control of glucose homeostasis and in the development of glucotoxicity. In a second part, some proteomic data linked with the effect of glucotoxicity in pancreas, pancreatic islets and beta-cells will be presented and discussed.","Brunner, YannickSchvartz, DomitillePriego-Capote, FelicianoCouté, YohannSanchez, Jean-Charles","Brunner YSchvartz DPriego-Capote FCouté YSanchez JC","Biomedical Proteomics Research Group, University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland. yannick.brunner@unige.ch","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleReview","20081105","Netherlands","J Proteomics","Journal of proteomics","101475056","0 (Insulin)0 (Proteome)9007-92-5 (Glucagon)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IM","Adipose Tissue/metabolismAnimalsBrain/metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2Glucagon/metabolismGlucose/*metabolism/toxicityHumansInsulin/*metabolismIslets of Langerhans/*metabolismLiver/metabolismMuscles/metabolismPancreas/*metabolismProteome/*metabolismRF   189",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2008/11/26 09:00","2009/03/14 09:00",NA,"2008/11/26 09:00","2008/06/24 00:00 [received]2008/09/29 00:00 [revised]2008/10/18 00:00 [accepted]2008/11/26 09:00 [pubmed]2009/03/14 09:00 [medline]2008/11/26 09:00 [entrez]","S1874-3919(08)00162-0 [pii]10.1016/j.jprot.2008.10.002 [doi]","ppublish","J Proteomics. 2009 Jan 30;71(6):576-91. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2008.10.002.

T2DM physiopathology is influenced by complex interrelationships between genetic, metabolic and lifestyle factors (including diet), which differ between populations and geographic regions. In fact, excessive consumptions of high fat/high sugar foods generally increase the risk of developing T2DM, whereas habitual intakes of plant-based healthy diets usually exert a protective effect. Moreover, genomic studies have allowed the characterization of sequence DNA variants across the human genome, some of which may affect gene expression and protein functions relevant for glucose homeostasis. This comprehensive literature review covers the impact of gene-diet interactions on T2DM susceptibility and disease progression, some of which have demonstrated a value as biomarkers of personal responses to certain nutritional interventions. Also, novel genotype-based dietary strategies have been developed for improving T2DM control in comparison to general lifestyle recommendations. Furthermore, progresses in other omics areas (epigenomics, metagenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) are improving current understanding of genetic insights in T2DM clinical outcomes. Although more investigation is still needed, the analysis of the genetic make-up may help to decipher new paradigms in the pathophysiology of T2DM as well as offer further opportunities to personalize the screening, prevention, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of T2DM through precision nutrition.","Ramos-Lopez, Omar","Ramos-Lopez O","Medicine and Psychology School, Autonomous University of Baja California, Tijuana 22390, Baja California, Mexico. oscar.omar.ramos.lopez@uabc.edu.mx.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleReview",NA,"United States","World J Diabetes","World journal of diabetes","101547524",NA,NA,NA,"PMC10921165",NA,"NOTNLM","DietGenotypeNutrigeneticsPrecision nutritionSingle nucleotide polymorphismType 2 diabetes mellitus","Conflict-of-interest statement: All the authors report no relevant conflicts of interest for this article.","2024/03/11 06:42","2024/03/11 06:43","2024/02/15","2024/03/11 04:34","2023/10/14 00:00 [received]2023/12/07 00:00 [revised]2024/01/11 00:00 [accepted]2024/03/11 06:43 [medline]2024/03/11 06:42 [pubmed]2024/03/11 04:34 [entrez]2024/02/15 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.4239/wjd.v15.i2.142 [doi]","ppublish","World J Diabetes. 2024 Feb 15;15(2):142-153. doi: 10.4239/wjd.v15.i2.142.","©The Author(s) 2024.

METHODS: A prospective, parallel study in T2D (n = 23) and controls (n = 23). A hyperinsulinemic clamp was performed and normoglycemia induced in T2D [4.5 ± 0.07 mmol/L (81 ± 1.2 mg/dl)] for 1-h, following which blood glucose was decreased to ≤2.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dl). Proteomic analysis for the complement and coagulation cascades were measured using Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan. RESULTS: Thirty-four proteins were measured. At baseline, 4 of 18 were found to differ in T2D versus controls for platelet degranulation [Neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (p = 0.014), Thrombospondin-1 (p = 0.012), Platelet factor-4 (p = 0.007), and Kininogen-1 (p = 0.05)], whilst 3 of 16 proteins differed for complement and coagulation cascades [Coagulation factor IX (p < 0.05), Kininogen-1 (p = 0.05), and Heparin cofactor-2 (p = 0.007)]; STRING analysis demonstrated the close relationship of these proteins to one another. Induced euglycemia in T2D showed no protein changes versus baseline. At hypoglycemia, however, four proteins changed in controls from baseline [Thrombospondin-1 (p < 0.014), platelet factor-4 (p < 0.01), Platelet basic protein (p < 0.008), and Vitamin K-dependent protein-C (p < 0.00003)], and one protein changed in T2D [Vitamin K-dependent protein-C, (p < 0.0002)]. CONCLUSION: Seven of 34 proteins suggested to be biomarkers of COVID-19 severity within the platelet degranulation and complement and coagulation cascades differed in T2D versus controls, with further changes occurring at hypoglycemia, suggesting that validation of these biomarkers is critical.

METHODS: Based on patient clinical histories, patient samples were assigned to diabetes mellitus osteoarthritis (DMOA) and OA groups. A data-independent acquisition method for data collection was used with proteomic data analysis to assess intergroup proteomic differences. Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway enrichment analysis were used to further find the correlation between T2DM and OA. RESULTS: GO functional analysis found 153 differentially expressed proteins between DMOA and OA groups, of which 92 differentially expressed proteins were significantly up-regulated and 61 were significantly down-regulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway analysis found 180 pathways, including 9 pathways significantly enriched. Further data analysis revealed that 6 signaling pathways were closely associated with T2DM and OA. CONCLUSION: OA and DMOA onset and progression were closely related to synthesis and metabolism of extracellular matrix components (e.g., fibronectin, decorin, etc.). The effects of T2DM on OA occur though 2 major ways of oxidative stress and low-grade chronic inflammation, involving in 2 inhibited signaling pathways and 4 activated signaling pathways.","Zhao, LuluWu, TongLi, JiayiCai, ChunyanYao, QingqiangZhu, Yi-Shen","Zhao LWu TLi JCai CYao QZhu YS","School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, PR China.College of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, PR China.Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Nanjing First Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, PR China.Key Lab of Additive Manufacturing Technology, Institute of Digital Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, PR China.School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, PR China.Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Nanjing First Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, PR China.Key Lab of Additive Manufacturing Technology, Institute of Digital Medicine, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, PR China.College of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, PR China.","eng","BK20200001/Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province/82072400/National Natural Science Foundation of China/BK20200144/Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province/BE2019736/Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program/","Journal Article",NA,"United States","Medicine (Baltimore)","Medicine","2985248R","0 (Proteome)","IM","*Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/geneticsGene OntologyHumans*Osteoarthritis/geneticsProteome/*geneticsProteomics","PMC8812634",NA,NA,NA,"The authors have no conflicts of interests to disclose.","2022/02/05 06:00","2022/02/17 06:00","2022/02/04","2022/02/04 08:41","2021/09/25 00:00 [received]2022/01/11 00:00 [accepted]2022/02/04 08:41 [entrez]2022/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]2022/02/17 06:00 [medline]2022/02/04 00:00 [pmc-release]","00005792-202202040-00027 [pii]MD-D-21-06587 [pii]10.1097/MD.0000000000028738 [doi]","ppublish","Medicine (Baltimore). 2022 Feb 4;101(5):e28738. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000028738.","Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

However, the relevant molecular mechanisms and biomarkers for early DRD are poorly defined. The purpose of this study was to uncover novel potential mediators of early diabetic retinal neuronal dysfunction through analysis of the aqueous fluid proteome in preclinical DR. METHODS: Aqueous fluid was collected from subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) but no clinical DR and from nondiabetic controls undergoing routine cataract surgery. Preoperative spectral-domain optical coherence tomography of the macula was obtained. Tandem mass tag LC-MS/MS was performed to identify proteins differentially present in diabetic and control aqueous fluid, and proteins with >50% change and P < 0.05 were considered significant. Selected results were validated with western blot of human aqueous fluid samples. RESULTS: We identified decreased levels of proteins implicated in neuronal synapse formation and increased levels of inflammatory proteins in the aqueous fluid from patients with type 2 DM but no DR compared with controls. Of the differentially present synaptic proteins that we identified and confirmed with western blot, the majority have not previously been linked with DRD. CONCLUSIONS: The proteomic profile of aqueous fluid from individuals with type 2 DM but no DR suggests that retinal neuronal dysfunction and inflammation represent very early events in the pathophysiology of DRD. These findings support the concept that diabetic retinal neurodegeneration precedes vascular pathology and reveal novel potential mediators and/or biomarkers warranting further investigation.","Sachdeva, Mira MLee, YoonjungUnlu, Eda KKoseoglu, Neslihan DCha, EumeeWang, JiangxiaPrescott, Christina REghrari, Allen ONa, Chan Hyun","Sachdeva MMLee YUnlu EKKoseoglu NDCha EWang JPrescott CREghrari AONa CH","Retina Division, Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States.Neurology, Institute for Cell Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States.Retina Division, Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States.Retina Division, Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States.Retina Division, Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States.Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, United States.Cornea Division, Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States.Cornea Division, Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States.Neurology, Institute for Cell Engineering, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States.","eng","K08 EY029766/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United StatesS10 OD021844/OD/NIH HHS/United States","Journal Article",NA,"United States","Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci","Investigative ophthalmology & visual science","7703701","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Humans*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications*Diabetic RetinopathyAqueous HumorChromatography, LiquidLiquid Chromatography-Mass SpectrometryProteomicsTandem Mass Spectrometry*Retinal DiseasesBiomarkers","PMC10939138",NA,NA,NA,"Disclosure: M.M.

Although research into its mechanism has received the attention it deserves, our understanding of T2D is still limited. This case-control study employs untargeted metabolomics to explore novel T2D plasma biomarkers in the Emirati population. Ninety-two UAE nationals were included in the cohort, with fifty T2D and forty-two non-T2D profiles. Participants were then stratified into three groups based on metabolic profiles, clinically verified diabetic status, and current HbA1c values: namely controlled diabetics, uncontrolled diabetics and prediabetics, and non-diabetics. The study identified fifteen significant differentially abundant metabolites between the uncontrolled diabetics group and the prediabetics or controlled diabetics group. Interestingly, some metabolites essential for the corticosteroid and thyroid signaling pathways were found to be significantly elevated in poorly controlled T2D, including cortisol, glycocholic acid, bile acids, thyroxine, and the tryptophan metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. These findings align with those from prior western cohorts and suggest an intriguing linkage between T2D glycemic control and thyroid and adrenal signaling that may provide new diagnostic and prognostic indicators. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: This study investigates the underlooked metabolomic role and correlation with T2D in the UAE population. The report indicates fifteen significant differentially abundant metabolites between on diabetics, uncontrolled diabetics and or controlled diabetics or prediabetics. This panel of metabolites such as thyroxine and corticosteroids should be considered further as potential diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for T2D in the region.","Banimfreg, Bayan HassanShamayleh, AbdulrahimAlshraideh, HussamSemreen, Mohammad HarbSoares, Nelson C","Banimfreg BHShamayleh AAlshraideh HSemreen MHSoares NC","College of Engineering, Department of Industrial Engineering, American University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.College of Engineering, Department of Industrial Engineering, American University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.College of Engineering, Department of Industrial Engineering, American University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.College of Pharmacy, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates; Sharjah Institute for Medical Research, University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.College of Pharmacy, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates; Sharjah Institute for Medical Research, University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.

We aimed to synthesise existing evidence on the observational and genetic associations between circulating proteins and CMD. METHODS: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched until July 2023 for potentially relevant prospective observational and Mendelian randomisation (MR) studies investigating associations between circulating proteins and CMD, including coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and atherosclerosis. Two investigators independently extracted study characteristics using a standard form and pooled data using random effects models. RESULTS: 50 observational, 25 MR and 10 studies performing both analyses were included, involving 26 414 160 non-overlapping participants. Meta-analysis of observational studies revealed 560 proteins associated with CMD, of which 133 proteins were associated with ≥2 CMDs (ie, pleiotropic). There were 245 potentially causal protein biomarkers identified in MR pooled results, involving 23 pleiotropic proteins. IL6RA and MMP12 were each causally associated with seven diseases. 22 protein-disease pairs showed directionally concordant associations in observational and MR pooled estimates. Addition of protein biomarkers to traditional clinical models modestly improved the accuracy of predicting incident CMD, with the highest improvement for heart failure (ΔC-index ~0.2). Of the 245 potentially causal proteins (291 protein-disease pairs), 3 pairs were validated by evidence of drug development from existing drug databases, 288 pairs lacked evidence of drug development and 66 proteins were drug targets approved for other indications. CONCLUSIONS: Combined analyses of observational and genetic studies revealed the potential causal role of several proteins in the aetiology of CMD. Novel protein biomarkers are promising targets for drug development and risk stratification.

So far, the pathogenesis of diabetes has not been fully elucidated. Identifying new potential molecule mechanisms and biomarkers in this process could contribute to the understanding of pathophysiology. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Proteomic changes in the liver of type 2 diabetic mice (n = 6) and normal mice (n = 6) are studied. Triplicate experiments are carried out for each sample. RESULTS: A total of 15 differentially expressed proteins (DEP(S) ) are identified and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis indicates that DEP(S) mainly involved two inflammatory pathways: glutathione metabolic pathway and the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway. The core of protein-protein interaction is the tumor necrosis factor inflammatory pathway, indicating the connection between inflammation and diabetes. Ten out of fifteen gene transcript levels are consistent with proteomics by quantitative RT-PCR validation. The transcriptional levels of OAT (ornithine aminotransferase) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase1 (FBP1) were significantly increased, whereas fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) and ef-2 transcription levels decreased significantly. In addition, western blotting results showed that the expression of OAT and FBP protein increased significantly in the diabetes group, while elongation factor 2 decreased significantly and FABP do not have significant difference in the diabetes group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Taken together, the present exploratory liver proteomic analysis might be seen as an important starting point for studies targeting specific liver proteins aimed at the implementation of new biomarkers for the early detection of type 2 diabetes mellitus-related potential mechanisms, hoping to provide biomarkers and clinical therapeutic targets of type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Wang, NiannianZhang, ShuZhu, FeifeiYang, YanhuaChen, LiangLü, PengYu, LiChen, Keping","Wang NZhang SZhu FYang YChen LLü PYu LChen K","Institute of Life Sciences, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212000, Jiangsu, China.School of Food and Biological Engineering, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212000, Jiangsu, China.Institute of Life Sciences, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212000, Jiangsu, China.Institute of Life Sciences, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212000, Jiangsu, China.Institute of Life Sciences, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212000, Jiangsu, China.Institute of Life Sciences, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212000, Jiangsu, China.Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212000, Jiangsu, China.Institute of Life Sciences, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, 212000, Jiangsu, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20180813","Germany","Proteomics Clin Appl","Proteomics.

Diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. The prevalence of AD and T2DM is increasing at an alarming rate and has become a major public health concern worldwide. The clinico-pathological relationship between AD and T2DM has been debated for more than a decade. Recent epidemiological studies have provided direct evidence that T2DM is a strong risk factor for AD and numerous studies have demonstrated that patients with diabetes have an increased risk of developing AD as compared with healthy individuals. The underlying biological mechanisms that link the development of diabetes with AD are not fully understood and therefore are worth intensive research. The existence of proteomic links between AD and diabetes is an important topic currently under active debate. An understanding of the complex association between diabetes and AD is necessary for the development of novel drug therapies and lifestyle guidelines aimed at the treatment and/or prevention of these diseases. This review aims to summarize what is currently known about the biological and especially proteomic relationships and similarities between these two age-related devastating diseases of modern day life. This study may also aid in future for the identification of a single or a panel of potential blood-based protein biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD and T2DM with high sensitivity and specificity.","Mirza, ZeenatAli, AshrafAshraf, Ghulam MdKamal, Mohammad AAbuzenadah, Adel MChoudhary, Adeel GDamanhouri, Ghazi ASheikh, Ishfaq A","Mirza ZAli AAshraf GMKamal MAAbuzenadah AMChoudhary AGDamanhouri GASheikh IA","Proteomics & Structural Biology Unit, Fundamental & Applied Biology Group, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, P.O.

Seven proteins were predictive of all three outcomes (SEM4A, PSB3, dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase, C1RL1, T132A, pyruvate carboxylase, and C1-esterase inhibitor) and have been implicated in immune regulatory mechanisms, metabolic dysregulation, proteostasis, and cellular signaling pathways. Elastic net Cox proportional hazards model identified distinct multiprotein signatures (38–68 proteins) of time to albuminuria, hyperfiltration, and rapid eGFR decline with concordance for models with clinical covariates and selected proteins between 0.81 and 0.96, whereas the concordance for models with clinical covariates only was between 0.56 and 0.63. BACKGROUND: The onset of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus often occurs early, leading to complications in young adulthood. Risk biomarkers associated with the early onset of DKD are urgently needed in youth with T2D. METHODS: We conducted an in-depth analysis of 6596 proteins (SomaScan 7K) in 374 baseline plasma samples from the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth study to identify multiprotein signatures associated with the onset of albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g), a rapid decline in eGFR (annual eGFR decline >3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and/or ≥3.3% at two consecutive visits), and hyperfiltration (≥135 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) at two consecutive visits). Elastic net Cox regression with ten-fold cross-validation was applied to the top 100 proteins (ranked by P value) to identify multiprotein signatures of time to development of DKD outcomes. RESULTS: Participants in the Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth study (14±2 years, 63% female, 7±6 months diabetes duration) experienced high rates of early DKD: 43% developed albuminuria, 48% hyperfiltration, and 16% rapid eGFR decline. Increased levels of seven and three proteins were predictive of shorter time to develop albuminuria and rapid eGFR decline, respectively; 118 proteins predicted time to development of hyperfiltration. Elastic net Cox proportional hazards models identified multiprotein signatures of time to incident early DKD with concordance for models with clinical covariates and selected proteins between 0.81 and 0.96, whereas the concordance for models with clinical covariates only was between 0.56 and 0.63. CONCLUSIONS: Our research sheds new light on proteomic changes early in the course of youth-onset T2D that associate with DKD. Proteomic analyses identified promising risk factors that predict DKD risk in youth with T2D and could deepen our understanding of DKD mechanisms and potential interventions.

Physical activities such as aerobic exercise play a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, metabolic pathways, oxidative stress, fibrosis, ECM remodeling, and muscle regeneration by modulating differentially expressed protein (DEP) levels. The objectives of our research were to investigate the effect of six weeks of aerobic exercise on the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle of db/db mice's DEP levels compared to those of sedentary db/db mice. A total of eight db/db mice were divided into two groups (n = 4 per group), namely sedentary mice (SED) and exercise-trained mice (ET), of which the latter were subjected to six weeks of a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention for five days per week. After the exercise intervention, biochemical tests, including analyses of blood glucose and HbA1c levels, were performed. Histological analysis using H & E staining on tissue was performed to compare morphological characters. Gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were dissected and processed for proteomic analysis. Data were provided and analyzed based on the DEPs using the label-free quantification (LFQ) algorithm. Functional enrichment analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were employed as bioinformatics tools to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the DEPs and disease progression. Significantly reduced blood glucose and HbA1c levels and an increased cross-sectional area (CSA) of gastrocnemius muscle fibers were seen in the ET group after the exercise interventions due to upregulations of metabolic pathways. Using proteomics data analysis, we found a significant decrease in COL1A1, COL4A2, ENG, and LAMA4 protein levels in the ET gastrocnemius, showing a significant improvement in fibrosis recovery, ECM remodeling, and muscle regeneration via the downregulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Upregulated metabolic pathways due to ET-regulated DEPs in the gastrocnemius indicated increased glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, muscle regeneration, and insulin sensitivity, which play a crucial role in muscle regeneration and maintaining blood glucose and lipid levels. No significant changes were observed in the soleus muscle due to the type of exercise and muscle fiber composition. Our research suggests that engaging in six weeks of aerobic exercise may have a positive impact on the recovery of T2DM-induced sarcopenia, which might be a potential candidate for mitigation, prevention, and therapeutic treatment in the future.","Huang, Yen-ChunSanotra, Monika RenukaHuang, Chi-ChangHsu, Yi-JuLiao, Chen-Chung","Huang YCSanotra MRHuang CCAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-1446-6787Hsu YJLiao CCAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6634-8355","Graduate Institute of Sports Science, National Taiwan Sport University, Taoyuan 333325, Taiwan.Marker Exploration Corporation, Taipei 112022, Taiwan.Marker Exploration Corporation, Taipei 112022, Taiwan.Department of Cardiology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei 112201, Taiwan.Graduate Institute of Sports Science, National Taiwan Sport University, Taoyuan 333325, Taiwan.Tajen University, Pingtung 907101, Taiwan.Graduate Institute of Sports Science, National Taiwan Sport University, Taoyuan 333325, Taiwan.Cancer and Immunology Research Center, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei 112304, Taiwan.","eng","MOST110-2410-HA49A-514/Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan/","Journal Article","20240320","Switzerland","Life (Basel)","Life (Basel, Switzerland)","101580444",NA,NA,NA,"PMC10971967",NA,"NOTNLM","ECM remodelingT2DM-induced sarcopeniaaerobic exercisedb/db micegastrocnemius musclemetabolic pathwaysmuscle regenerationproteomic profiling","Authors Yen-Chun Huang and Monika Renuka Sanotra were employed by the company Marker Exploration Corporation.

Proteins increased in AD have been reported to include fibronectin (FN) fragments 3 and 4 (FN1.3 and FN1.4, respectively) and ApoE. We hypothesized that Alzheimer-related proteins would be dysregulated in PCOS because of associated insulin resistance and obesity. In this comparative cross-sectional analysis, aptamer-based SomaScan proteomic analysis for the detection of plasma Alzheimer-related proteins was undertaken in a PCOS biobank of 143 women with PCOS and 97 control women. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) (p < 0.05) and amyloid P-component (APCS) (p < 0.001) were elevated in PCOS, while alpha-synuclein (SNCA) (p < 0.05) was reduced in PCOS. Associations with protective heat shock proteins (HSPs) showed that SNCA positively correlated with HSP90 (p < 0.0001) and HSP60 (p < 0.0001) in both the PCOS and control women. Correlations with markers of inflammation showed that APCS correlated with interleukin 6 (IL6) (p = 0.04), while Apolipoprotein (Apo) E3 correlated with TNF-alpha (p = 0.02). FN, FN1.3, FN1.4 and ApoE were all elevated significantly (p < 0.05). An AD-associated protein pattern with elevated FN, FN1.3, FN1.4 and ApoE was found in PCOS, in addition to elevated APP and reduced SNCA, which was the same as reported for type 2 diabetes (T2D) with, additionally, an elevation in APCS. With the AD biomarker pattern in PCOS being very similar to that in T2D, where there is an association between AD and T2D, this suggests that larger prospective cohort studies are needed in women with PCOS to determine if there is a causal association with AD.","Butler, Alexandra EMoin, Abu Saleh MdSathyapalan, ThozhukatAtkin, Stephen L","Butler AEAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5762-3917Moin ASMSathyapalan TAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3544-2231Atkin SLAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5887-7257","Research Department, Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, Busaiteen P.O.

Since hyperglycemia is able to change the protein components contained in plasma exosomes, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is considered as feasible to analyze the expression of plasma exosomal proteins in patients with T2DM and non-diabetic patients respectively, find critical biological markers, and explore the mechanism of DK as well as potential therapeutic targets. METHOD: Blood and clinical information of corneal epithelial injury in a diabetic group (the study group) and a non-diabetic group (the control group), who were patients admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology, Yangpu Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine from July 2020 to November 2020, were collected. The qEV size exclusion method was adopted to separate exosomes from plasma. The exosomes were then identified through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analyzer (NTA), and Western blot. The plasma exosomes of the study group and the control group were quantitatively analyzed by proteomics. A bioinformatics method is utilized to screen differential proteins and the expression of the differential proteins was verified by Western blot. RESULT: TEM indicated that the exosomes had a double-concave disc-like appearance, with a size of about 100 nm, and Western blot expressed as CD63 and TSG101. The plasma exosomes of the study group and the control group were analyzed by quantitative proteomics with a total number of 952 proteins detected of which 245 proteins existed in the ExoCarta exosomal protein database. Through adoption of P-value to screen credible differential proteins, the heat map displayed 28 differential proteins, 7 upregulated proteins, and 21 downregulated proteins; the volcano map displayed 7 upregulated proteins and 22 downregulated proteins; the PPI interaction map displayed 12 upregulated proteins and 18 downregulated proteins. Through GO enrichment analysis, it was identified that the differential protein participated in the main biological processes and was involved in regulating the cell's stimulation response to insulin, the insulin receptor signaling pathway, and the activity of glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase D as well as anti-oxidation. The enriched cell components include main components such as exosomes, blood particles, and cytoplasm. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the target protein FLOT2 was mainly concentrated in insulin-related signaling pathways. Western blot indicated that the expression of FLOT2 in the study group was lower compared with the control group while the expression of Exo70 was higher. CONCLUSION: Proteomic analysis of the study group and the control group displayed a variety of proteins in plasma exosomes. The downregulated protein FLOT2 in the study group was closely related to the occurrence, development, and complication of DK in T2DM patients. The expression status of plasma FLOT2 protein in T2DM patients is expected to be a biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring of DK.","Chen, KaichuanSheng, MinjieZhang, JieYan, GuoquanLi, Bing","Chen KSheng MZhang JYan GLi B","Department of Ophthalmology, Yangpu Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200090, China; Department of Ophthalmology, Tongji Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200065, China.Department of Ophthalmology, Yangpu Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200090, China.Department of Ophthalmology, Yangpu Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200090, China.Institutes of Biomedical Science Fudan University, 131# Dong'an Rd, Shanghai, 200032, PR China.Department of Ophthalmology, Yangpu Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200090, China.

The complement pathway proteins in hypoglycemia are not well studied. Here, we hypothesized that these circulating proteins would be elevated in response to hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes (T2D) through the inflammatory response. METHODS: A prospective, parallel study in T2D (n = 23) and controls (n = 23). Subjects underwent insulin-induced hypoglycemia with blood sampling at baseline, hypoglycemia and post-hypoglycemia; SOMAscan proteomic analysis of complement pathway-related proteins, cytokines and inflammatory proteins was undertaken. RESULTS: At baseline: Complement C2 (p < 0.05) and Factor B (p < 0.05) were elevated in T2D. At hypoglycemia: Complement C2 (p < 0.05) and Factor B (p < 0.01) remained elevated, whilst Factor I became elevated (p < 0.05) in T2D; Complement C4b became elevated in controls (p < 0.05). In the post-hypoglycemia follow up period, Complement C2, Factor B and Factor I remained elevated in T2D; in addition, Factor D, Factor H and mannose-binding protein C showed elevations in T2D, whilst properdin, complement C3b, Factor H-related protein 5, complement C1q and decay-accelerating factor (DAF) showed elevations in controls. Granger causality analysis showed that inflammatory proteins appeared to drive complement protein changes in T2D; conversely, in controls, complement proteins drove inflammatory protein changes. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline elevations in C2 and Factor B indicate upregulation of the complement pathway in T2D. Changes in complement pathway-related protein levels in response to hypoglycemia suggest both intrinsic and alternative pathway activation at 2-h that appears driven by the underlying inflammation in T2D and could contribute to a cardiovascular event.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03102801.

This study aimed to decipher the causal associations of circulating proteins with fasting glucose (FG), 2-h glucose after an oral glucose challenge (2hGlu), fasting insulin (FI), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) using large-scale proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Genetic data on plasma proteomes were obtained from 10 proteomic genome-wide association studies. Both cis-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) and cis + trans-pQTLs MR analyses were conducted. Bayesian colocalization, Steiger filtering analysis, assessment of protein-altering variants, and mapping expression QTLs to pQTLs were performed to investigate the reliability of the MR findings. Protein-protein interaction, pathway enrichment analysis, and evaluation of drug targets were performed. Thirty-three proteins were identified with causal effects on FG, FI, or HbA1c but not 2hGlu in the cis-pQTL analysis, and 93 proteins had causal effects on glycemic traits in the cis + trans-pQTLs analysis. Most proteins were either considered druggable or drug targets. In conclusion, many novel circulating protein biomarkers were identified to be causally associated with glycemic traits. These biomarkers enhance the understanding of molecular etiology and provide insights into the screening, monitoring, and treatment of diabetes.","Xing, XingXu, SiqiWang, YiningShen, ZiyuanWen, SiminZhang, YanRuan, GuangfengCai, Guoqi","Xing XXu SWang YAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3538-2312Shen ZWen SZhang YRuan GCai GAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6481-704X","Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.Clinical Research Centre, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.Clinical Research Centre, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.Clinical Research Centre, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.Clinical Research Centre, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.","eng","82103933/National Natural Science Foundation of China/2021xkjT006/Scientific Research Level Upgrading Project of Anhui Medical University/","Journal Article",NA,"United States","Diabetes","Diabetes","0372763","0 (Proteome)0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Glycated Hemoglobin)0 (Insulin)0 (Biomarkers)","IM","*Mendelian Randomization AnalysisHumans*Proteome/metabolism*Quantitative Trait Loci*Blood Glucose/metabolism*Genome-Wide Association Study*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/genetics/blood/metabolism*Glycated Hemoglobin/metabolismInsulin/blood/metabolismBiomarkers/bloodProteomics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024/10/18 07:19","2024/12/20 18:20",NA,"2024/10/17 13:44","2024/03/28 00:00 [received]2024/09/30 00:00 [accepted]2024/12/20 18:20 [medline]2024/10/18 07:19 [pubmed]2024/10/17 13:44 [entrez]","157391 [pii]10.2337/db24-0262 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes. 2025 Jan 1;74(1):108-119. doi: 10.2337/db24-0262.","© 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",NA,NA,"10.2337/db24-0262",NA,2025

Large-scale proteomic studies on animal models of T2DM are of great importance to understand the pathophysiology of T2DM. Therefore, in our study, Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) were used for proteomic analysis of skeletal muscles from T2DM-susceptible and -tolerant Bama mini-pig models induced by a high-fat, high-sugar diet. In our proteomic analysis, a total of 1646 proteins and 13 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified by iTRAQ-mass spectrometry, and 6 differentially expressed proteins were validated by PRM. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that most DEPs were extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and participated in several biological processes, such as negative regulation of JAK-STAT cascade, negative regulation of STAT cascade, roundabout signaling pathway and peptide cross-linking via chondroitin 4-sulfate glycosaminoglycan, and the molecular functions of roundabout binding, glycosaminoglycan binding, heparin binding, sulfur compound binding, collagen binding, and kinase inhibitor activity. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis results showed that the differentially expressed proteins were involved in 14 pathways, including human disease pathways, metabolic pathways, signal transduction pathways, signaling molecules and interaction pathways, and the cellular process pathways associated with phagosomes and focal adhesion. In conclusion, the proteomics based on iTRAQ and PRM in T2DM-susceptible and -tolerant Bama mini-pig models showed that changes in amino acid metabolism, inflammation-associated pathways and the impaired function and environment of extracellular matrix are risk factors associated with increased pathogenesis of T2DM in Bama mini-pig.","Yan, XueyuWu, YanjunZhong, FangjieJiang, QinyangZhou, TingtingGuo, YafenYang, XiurongLiang, JingJoshua Liao, DLan, Ganqiu","Yan XWu YZhong FJiang QZhou TGuo YYang XLiang JJoshua Liao DLan G","College of Animal Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.College of Animal Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.Qinzhou Aquatic Product Technology Promotion Department, Guangxi, China.College of Animal Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.College of Animal Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.College of Animal Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.College of Animal Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.College of Animal Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, USA.College of Animal Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.

A non-human primate model such as cynomolgus monkeys can develop T2DM spontaneously in an age-dependent way similar to humans. In this study, a data-independent acquisition-based quantitative proteomics strategy was employed to investigate the serum proteomic profiles of spontaneously diabetic cynomolgus monkeys compared with healthy controls. The results revealed significant differences in protein abundances. A total of 95 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were quantitatively identified in the current study, among which 31 and 64 proteins were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that carbohydrate digestion and absorption was the top enriched pathway by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Protein-protein interaction network analysis demonstrated that MST1 was identified as the most connected protein in the network and could be considered as the hub protein. MST1 was significantly and inversely associated with FSG and HbA1c. Furthermore, recent lines of evidence also indicate that MST1 acts as a crucial regulator in regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis to maintain metabolic homeostasis while simultaneously suppressing the inflammatory processes. In conclusion, our study provides novel insights into serum proteome changes in spontaneously diabetic cynomolgus monkeys and points out that the dysregulation of several DEPs may play an important role in the pathogenesis of T2DM.","Tian, ChaoyangQiu, MingyinLv, HaizhouYue, FengZhou, Feifan","Tian CAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7985-1793Qiu MLv HYue FZhou F","Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Hainan Province, School of Biomedical Engineering, Hainan University, Haikou, Hainan 570228, China.One Health Institute, Hainan University, Haikou, Hainan 570228, China.Animal Experiment Department, Hainan Jingang Biotech Co., Ltd., Haikou, Hainan 571100, China.Animal Experiment Department, Hainan Jingang Biotech Co., Ltd., Haikou, Hainan 571100, China.Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Hainan Province, School of Biomedical Engineering, Hainan University, Haikou, Hainan 570228, China.One Health Institute, Hainan University, Haikou, Hainan 570228, China.Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Hainan Province, School of Biomedical Engineering, Hainan University, Haikou, Hainan 570228, China.One Health Institute, Hainan University, Haikou, Hainan 570228, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20221206","United States","ACS Omega","ACS omega","101691658",NA,NA,NA,"PMC9774375",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare no competing financial interest.","2022/12/27 06:00","2022/12/27 06:01","2022/12/06","2022/12/26 04:31","2022/09/02 00:00 [received]2022/11/23 00:00 [accepted]2022/12/26 04:31 [entrez]2022/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]2022/12/27 06:01 [medline]2022/12/06 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1021/acsomega.2c05663 [doi]","epublish","ACS Omega. 2022 Dec 6;7(50):46702-46716. doi: 10.1021/acsomega.2c05663. eCollection 2022 Dec 20.","© 2022 The Authors.

Importantly, these pathologies could induce synergetic alterations in the heart, and the discovery of key common molecular signaling may suggest new targets for therapy. Intraoperative cardiac biopsies were obtained from patients with coronary heart disease and preserved systolic function, with or without HTN and/or T2DM, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Control (n = 5), HTN (n = 7), and HTN + T2DM (n = 7) samples were analysed by proteomics and bioinformatics. Additionally, cultured rat cardiomyocytes were used for the analysis (protein level and activation, mRNA expression, and bioenergetic performance) of key molecular mediators under stimulation of main components of HTN and T2DM (high glucose and/or fatty acids and angiotensin-II). As results, in cardiac biopsies, we found significant alterations of 677 proteins and after filtering for non-cardiac factors, 529 and 41 were changed in HTN-T2DM and in HTN subjects, respectively, against the control. Interestingly, 81% of proteins in HTN-T2DM were distinct from HTN, while 95% from HTN were common with HTN-T2DM. In addition, 78 factors were differentially expressed in HTN-T2DM against HTN, predominantly downregulated proteins of mitochondrial respiration and lipid oxidation. Bioinformatic analyses suggested the implication of mTOR signaling and reduction of AMPK and PPARα activation, and regulation of PGC1α, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. In cultured cardiomyocytes, an excess of the palmitate activated mTORC1 complex and subsequent attenuation of PGC1α-PPARα transcription of β-oxidation and mitochondrial electron chain factors affect mitochondrial/glycolytic ATP synthesis. Silencing of PGC1α further reduced total ATP and both mitochondrial and glycolytic ATP. Thus, the coexistence of HTN and T2DM induced higher alterations in cardiac proteins than HTN. HTN-T2DM subjects exhibited a marked downregulation of mitochondrial respiration and lipid metabolism and the mTORC1-PGC1α-PPARα axis might account as a target for therapeutical strategies.","Hang, TianyuLumpuy-Castillo, JairoGoikoetxea-Usandizaga, NaroaAzkargorta, MikelAldámiz, GonzaloMartínez-Milla, JuanForteza, AlbertoCortina, José MEgido, JesúsElortza, FélixMartínez-Chantar, MaluTuñón, JoséLorenzo, Óscar","Hang TAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3670-837XLumpuy-Castillo JAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-3458-0328Goikoetxea-Usandizaga NAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4569-028XAzkargorta MAldámiz GAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6369-448XMartínez-Milla JForteza ACortina JMEgido JElortza FAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8839-5438Martínez-Chantar MAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6446-9911Tuñón JAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1373-0999Lorenzo ÓAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5515-6078","Laboratory of Diabetes and Vascular Pathology, IIS-Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma, 28040 Madrid, Spain.Biomedical Research Network on Diabetes and Associated Metabolic Disorders (CIBERDEM), Carlos III National Health Institute, 28029 Madrid, Spain.Laboratory of Diabetes and Vascular Pathology, IIS-Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma, 28040 Madrid, Spain.Biomedical Research Network on Diabetes and Associated Metabolic Disorders (CIBERDEM), Carlos III National Health Institute, 28029 Madrid, Spain.Liver Disease Lab, Center for Cooperative Research in Biosciences (CIC bioGUNE), Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.Biomedical Research Network on Liver and Digestive Diseases (CIBERehd), Carlos III National Health Institute, 28029 Madrid, Spain.Proteomics Platform, Center for Cooperative Research in Biosciences (CIC bioGUNE), Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.Cardiovascular Surgery Department, Fundación Jiménez Díaz Hospital, 28040 Madrid, Spain.Cardiology Department, Fundación Jiménez Díaz Hospital, 28040 Madrid, Spain.Cardiovascular Surgery Department, Doce de Octubre Hospital, 28041 Madrid, Spain.Cardiovascular Surgery Department, Doce de Octubre Hospital, 28041 Madrid, Spain.Laboratory of Diabetes and Vascular Pathology, IIS-Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma, 28040 Madrid, Spain.Biomedical Research Network on Diabetes and Associated Metabolic Disorders (CIBERDEM), Carlos III National Health Institute, 28029 Madrid, Spain.Liver Disease Lab, Center for Cooperative Research in Biosciences (CIC bioGUNE), Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.Liver Disease Lab, Center for Cooperative Research in Biosciences (CIC bioGUNE), Basque Research and Technology Alliance (BRTA), 48160 Derio, Spain.Biomedical Research Network on Liver and Digestive Diseases (CIBERehd), Carlos III National Health Institute, 28029 Madrid, Spain.Cardiology Department, Fundación Jiménez Díaz Hospital, 28040 Madrid, Spain.Medicine Department, Universidad Autónoma, 28029 Madrid, Spain.Biomedical Research Network on Cardiovascular Diseases (CIBERCV), Carlos III National Health Institute, 28029 Madrid, Spain.Laboratory of Diabetes and Vascular Pathology, IIS-Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma, 28040 Madrid, Spain.Biomedical Research Network on Diabetes and Associated Metabolic Disorders (CIBERDEM), Carlos III National Health Institute, 28029 Madrid, Spain.","eng","PI18/01016 and PI20/00923/Instituto de Salud Carlos III/SPACE2-CV-COVID-CM grant from REACT-EU/Comunidad de Madrid and European Regional Development Fund/CB07/08/2007/Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red Diabetes y Enfermedades Metabólicas Asociadas/","Journal Article","20230511","Switzerland","Int J Mol Sci","International journal of molecular sciences","101092791","0 (PPAR alpha)EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)0 (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha)8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)","IM","HumansRatsAnimalsPPAR alpha/genetics/metabolismMechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/metabolismPeroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha/genetics/metabolism*Hypertension/complications/genetics/metabolism*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/genetics/metabolismMyocytes, Cardiac/metabolismAdenosine Triphosphate/metabolism","PMC10218005",NA,"NOTNLM","cardiomyopathyhypertensionmTOR complexestype-II diabetes","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","2023/05/27 09:42","2023/05/29 06:41","2023/05/11","2023/05/27 01:14","2023/03/27 00:00 [received]2023/05/04 00:00 [revised]2023/05/09 00:00 [accepted]2023/05/29 06:41 [medline]2023/05/27 09:42 [pubmed]2023/05/27 01:14 [entrez]2023/05/11 00:00 [pmc-release]","ijms24108629 [pii]ijms-24-08629 [pii]10.3390/ijms24108629 [doi]","epublish","Int J Mol Sci. 2023 May 11;24(10):8629. doi: 10.3390/ijms24108629.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/ijms24108629",NA,2023

METHODS: The urine proteomic profiling of T2DM patients (n = 94) and control group (n = 32) was compared by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and the untargeted LMW protein was identified by Progenesis Q1 For Proteomics v4.2. RESULTS: A total of 73 LMW proteins were identified and quantified, of which, 32 proteins were found to be altered significantly (p < 0.05). Further analysis with heat maps identified two potential proteins with the highest folding alterations in urine. V-ATPase subunit C 1 abundance was significantly inversely correlated with microalbumin and significantly decreased in urine, whereas increased IKBIP was positively correlated with microalbumin. The level of those proteins was significantly different among the control, T2DM, and DN groups, implying an association with the progression of DN. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings of our study indicate that the decreasing V-ATPase subunit C 1 together with increasing IKBIP in urine, were found to be closely associated with DN complications and signifying their value as biomarkers for predicting the risk of DN at initial diagnosis.","Darmayanti, SiskaLesmana, RonnyMeiliana, AnnaAbdulah, Rizky","Darmayanti SLesmana RMeiliana AAbdulah R","Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jatinangor, Indonesia; Prodia Clinical Laboratory, Jakarta, Indonesia.Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jatinangor, Indonesia; Center of Excellence for Pharmaceutical Care Innovation, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jatinangor, Indonesia.

Human population studies of T2D development and its effects on systemic metabolism are confounded by many factors that cannot be controlled, complicating the interpretation of results and the identification of early biomarkers. Aged, sedentary, and overweight/obese non-human primates (NHPs) are one of the best animal models to mimic spontaneous T2D development in humans. We sought to identify and distinguish a set of plasma and/or fecal metabolite biomarkers, that have earlier disease onset predictability, and that could be evaluated for their predictability in subsequent T2D studies in human cohorts. In this study, a single plasma and fecal sample was collected from each animal in a colony of 57 healthy and dysmetabolic NHPs and analyzed for metabolomics and lipidomics. The samples were comprehensively analyzed using untargeted and targeted LC/MS/MS. The changes in each animal's disease phenotype were monitored using IVGTT, HbA1c, and other clinical metrics, and correlated with their metabolic profile. The plasma and fecal lipids, as well as bile acid profiles, from Healthy, Dysmetabolic (Dys), and Diabetic (Dia) animals were compared. Following univariate and multivariate analyses, including adjustments for weight, age, and sex, several plasma lipid species were identified to be significantly different between these animal groups. Medium and long-chain plasma phosphatidylcholines (PCs) ranked highest at distinguishing Healthy from Dys animals, whereas plasma triglycerides (TG) primarily distinguished Dia from Dys animals. Random Forest (RF) analysis of fecal bile acids showed a reduction in the secondary bile acid glycoconjugate, GCDCA, in diseased animals (AUC 0.76[0.64, 0.89]). Moreover, metagenomics results revealed several bacterial species, belonging to the genera Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, and Streptococcus, to be both significantly enriched in non-healthy animals and associated with secondary bile acid levels. In summary, our results highlight the detection of several elevated circulating plasma PCs and microbial species associated with fecal secondary bile acids in NHP dysmetabolic states. The lipids and metabolites we have identified may help researchers to differentiate individual NHPs more precisely between dysmetabolic and overtly diabetic states. This could help assign animals to study groups that are more likely to respond to potential therapies where a difference in efficacy might be anticipated between early vs. advanced disease.","Tao, PeiningConarello, StaceyWyche, Thomas PZhang, Nanyan RenaChng, KeefeKang, JohnSana, Theodore R","Tao PConarello SWyche TPZhang NRChng KAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6861-0361Kang JSana TRAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8271-4431","BARDS-Biometrics Research, Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ 07065, USA.QA Animal Welfare, Merck & Co., Inc., West Point, PA 19486, USA.Quantitative Biosciences, Merck & Co., Inc., Cambridge, MA 02141, USA.Pharmacokinetics, Dynamics, Metabolism & Bioanalytics, Merck & Co., Inc., West Point, PA 19486, USA.Crown Bioscience Inc., San Diego, CA 92127, USA.BARDS-Biometrics Research, Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ 07065, USA.Quantitative Biosciences, Merck & Co., Inc., Cambridge, MA 02141, USA.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240309","Switzerland","Metabolites","Metabolites","101578790",NA,NA,NA,"PMC10972397",NA,"NOTNLM","LC/MSLODOPLS-DAbile acidsdysmetabolic and diabeticfeceslatent multivariate modelinglipidsmTICmachine learningmetabolomicsnon-human primates (NHPs)phosphatidylcholineplasmarandom foresttriglyceridestype 2 diabetes (T2D)","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","2024/03/27 12:51","2024/03/27 12:52","2024/03/09","2024/03/27 09:34","2024/01/17 00:00 [received]2024/02/20 00:00 [revised]2024/02/28 00:00 [accepted]2024/03/27 12:52 [medline]2024/03/27 12:51 [pubmed]2024/03/27 09:34 [entrez]2024/03/09 00:00 [pmc-release]","metabo14030159 [pii]metabolites-14-00159 [pii]10.3390/metabo14030159 [doi]","epublish","Metabolites. 2024 Mar 9;14(3):159. doi: 10.3390/metabo14030159.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/metabo14030159",NA,2024

Their effects on L-arginine (Arg) related risk markers asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA and SDMA) and the protective biomarker L-homoarginine (hArg) linking T2D to cardiovascular and renal disease have not yet been reported. METHODS: Plasma and 24-h urine samples taken before and after 6 weeks of treatment were available from two prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trials with empagliflozin (71 patients analyzed, NCT02471963) and dapagliflozin (59 patients analyzed, NCT02383238). In these samples, concentrations of hArg, Arg, ADMA, SDMA, and creatinine were determined by liquid-chromatography coupled to tandem mass-spectrometry. Additionally, intraindividual changes of the biomarkers in plasma were correlated with intraindividual changes of clinical parameters. RESULTS: Treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin was associated with a reduction of plasma hArg by 17.5% and 13.7% (both p < 0.001), respectively, and increase in plasma SDMA concentration of 6.7% and 3.6%, respectively (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05), while plasma Arg and ADMA concentrations were not significantly altered. 24-h urinary excretion of ADMA was reduced by 15.2% after treatment with empagliflozin (p < 0.001) but not after dapagliflozin treatment, while excretion of the other markers was not significantly altered. Renal clearance of SDMA was reduced by 9.1% and 3.9% for both drugs (both p < 0.05). A reduction in ADMA clearance was observable after empagliflozin treatment only (- 15.5%, p < 0.001), but not after dapagliflozin. Renal clearance of hArg and Arg was not significantly altered. Treatment effects on L-arginine related biomarkers were not constantly correlated with effects on glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, body mass index, and systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors has divergent effects on Arg-related biomarkers and could affect risk estimates associated with these markers. The observed effects are unlikely to explain the known cardiovascular and renal benefits of treatment with empagliflozin or dapagliflozin but still may indicate new therapeutic approaches in patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors.

However, potential mechanisms through which these clinical predictors relate to the onset of HF remain to be established. OBJECTIVES: The authors studied the association between clinical and proteomic risk profiles of new-onset HF in men and women. METHODS: Incident HF was studied in 478,479 participants from the UK Biobank. The association between new-onset HF and 8 common modifiable traditional risk factors, including obesity, smoking status, socioeconomic status, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and history of myocardial infarction, was assessed in men and women. Proteomics data (2,923 unique proteins, Olink) was available in 22,695 men and 27,421 women. Pathway over-representation analyses were performed to identify biological pathways in men and women with and without new-onset HF. Principal component analyses were performed to extract weighted scores for each pathway. Subsequently, weighted scores were used in mediation analyses to investigate how the pathways mediated the association between risk factors and new-onset HF. RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 12 years, HF incident rate was 3.60 per 1,000 person-years in men and 1.72 per 1,000 person-years in women (P < 0.001). The strongest risk factor for future HF was a history of myocardial infarction (HR: 2.61; 95% CI: 2.46-2.77) in men and atrial fibrillation (HR: 4.10; 95% CI: 3.58-4.71) in women. When a risk factor was present in women, it conferred a higher risk of new-onset HF compared with the presence of the same risk factor in men. Both in men and women, the population-attributable risk was highest for hypertension (25% in men, 29% in women) and obesity (16% in men, 21% in women). Pathway analyses of protein profiles indicated several inflammatory pathways, and neutrophil degranulation in particular, to be activated both in men and women who developed HF. These inflammatory pathways modestly (22% in men and 24% in women) contributed to the association between hypertension and new-onset HF, but showed a stronger contribution (33% in men and 47% in women) to the association between obesity and new-onset HF. CONCLUSIONS: In men and women, the most prominent risk factors for new-onset HF were hypertension and obesity, but they conferred a greater risk of new-onset HF in women. New-onset HF in both men and women was associated with pathophysiological pathways related to neutrophil degranulation and immunomodulation and these pathways partly mediated the association between hypertension, obesity, and new-onset HF.","Qin, HailunTromp, JasperTer Maaten, Jozine MVoordes, Geert H Dvan Essen, Bart JAndré de la Rambelje, Markvan der Hoef, Camilla C SSantema, Bernadet TLam, Carolyn S PVoors, Adriaan A","Qin HTromp JTer Maaten JMVoordes GHDvan Essen BJAndré de la Rambelje Mvan der Hoef CCSSantema BTLam CSPVoors AA","Department of Cardiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.Department of Cardiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands; Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and the National University Health System, Singapore; National Heart Centre Singapore and Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.Department of Cardiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.Department of Cardiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.Department of Cardiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.Department of Cardiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.Department of Cardiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.Department of Cardiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands; National Heart Centre Singapore and Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.Department of Cardiology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands.

However, a complete understanding of protein changes within the diabetic vasculature is still lacking. METHODS: Herein, we utilized mass spectrometry to perform vascular and urinary proteome analysis using a rat model of high-fat feeding and low-dose streptozotocin to simulate late-stage T2D. The purpose of this study was to identify aortic and urine proteins that are differentially expressed in normal and T2D rats. RESULTS: High-fat feeding and low-dose streptozotocin resulted in hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia and high levels of circulating free fatty acids. Using a shotgun proteomic approach, high-mobility-group protein B1 and spondin-1 were significantly increased in T2D aorta compared to control aorta, suggesting vascular inflammation and smooth muscle proliferation, respectively. However, the majority of differentially expressed aortic proteins were downregulated in T2D, including proteins associated with coagulation, cell differentiation and redox homeostasis. Strikingly, we report a significant downregulation of commonly used cytoskeletal housekeeping proteins in T2D aorta. Urine from T2D rats displayed increased expression of proteins involved in inflammation and oxidative stress and decreased expression of proteins associated with lipid metabolism and cell adhesion. A number of differentially expressed proteins in urine of T2D rats have previously been reported in human T2D, thereby supporting this animal model as a good representation of human T2D. CONCLUSIONS: Our data offer new information regarding key pathways that could be therapeutically targeted to combat the cardiovascular complications of T2D.","Dwinovan, JosuaColella, Alexander DChegeni, NushaChataway, Timothy KSokoya, Elke M","Dwinovan JColella ADChegeni NChataway TKSokoya EM","Discipline of Human Physiology, School of Medicine, Flinders University, Room 4E 432, Flinders Medical Centre, Flinders Drive, Bedford Park, SA, 5042, Australia.Discipline of Human Physiology, School of Medicine, Flinders University, Room 4E 432, Flinders Medical Centre, Flinders Drive, Bedford Park, SA, 5042, Australia.Discipline of Human Physiology, School of Medicine, Flinders University, Room 4E 432, Flinders Medical Centre, Flinders Drive, Bedford Park, SA, 5042, Australia.Discipline of Human Physiology, School of Medicine, Flinders University, Room 4E 432, Flinders Medical Centre, Flinders Drive, Bedford Park, SA, 5042, Australia.Discipline of Human Physiology, School of Medicine, Flinders University, Room 4E 432, Flinders Medical Centre, Flinders Drive, Bedford Park, SA, 5042, Australia. elke.sokoya@flinders.edu.au.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20161028","Germany","Acta Diabetol","Acta diabetologica","9200299","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Proteome)","IM","AnimalsAorta/*metabolismBiomarkers/blood/metabolism/urineDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental/blood/*metabolism/urineDown-Regulation*Genes, EssentialLipid MetabolismMaleOxidative StressProteome/chemistry/*genetics/metabolismRatsRats, Wistar",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","AortaDiabetesProteomicsUrineVasculature",NA,"2016/11/01 06:00","2017/02/28 06:00",NA,"2016/11/01 06:00","2016/08/01 00:00 [received]2016/10/07 00:00 [accepted]2016/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]2016/11/01 06:00 [entrez]","10.1007/s00592-016-0929-y [pii]10.1007/s00592-016-0929-y [doi]","ppublish","Acta Diabetol. 2017 Feb;54(2):171-190. doi: 10.1007/s00592-016-0929-y.

We exposed a mixture of five OCPs to zebrafish at concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.25, 2.5, and 25 μg/L for 12 weeks. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were quantitatively identified in female zebrafish livers, and its functional study was conducted. The significantly high glucose and low insulin levels were observed only at 0.05 μg/L, linking to the different pattern of DEPs than other concentrations. A total of 1082 proteins was quantified, of which 321 proteins formed 6 clusters in protein dynamics analysis. The enriched pathways in cluster 3 showing distinct pattern of DEPs could explain the nonlinear response at 0.05 μg/L, indicating that OCP mixtures adversely affected proteins associated with mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. We proposed a feasible mechanism that decrease in expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase led to abnormal accumulation of aldehydes, reducing expression of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and resulting in disruption of glucose homeostasis. Our findings help to better understand the causality of T2DM by exposure to OCP mixtures and to identify biomarkers in the protein expression level.","Gao, YanLee, HyojinLee, SangkyuKim, Ki-Tae","Gao YLee HLee SKim KTAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1130-8698","BK21 FOUR Community-Based Intelligent Novel Drug Discovery Education Unit, College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea.Department of Environmental Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul 01811, Korea.BK21 FOUR Community-Based Intelligent Novel Drug Discovery Education Unit, College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea.Department of Environmental Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul 01811, Korea.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20220420","Switzerland","Int J Environ Res Public Health","International journal of environmental research and public health","101238455","0 (Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated)0 (Pesticides)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IM","Animals*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/chemically induced/metabolismFemaleGlucose/metabolism*Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated/analysis/toxicity*Pesticides/analysisProteomicsZebrafish/metabolism","PMC9100612",NA,"NOTNLM","aldehyde dehydrogenase 2glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenaseorganochlorine pesticide mixturesproteomicstype 2 diabetes mellituszebrafish","The authors declare no competing financial interest.","2022/05/15 06:00","2022/05/18 06:00","2022/04/20","2022/05/14 01:12","2022/03/02 00:00 [received]2022/04/07 00:00 [revised]2022/04/15 00:00 [accepted]2022/05/14 01:12 [entrez]2022/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]2022/05/18 06:00 [medline]2022/04/20 00:00 [pmc-release]","ijerph19094991 [pii]ijerph-19-04991 [pii]10.3390/ijerph19094991 [doi]","epublish","Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2022 Apr 20;19(9):4991. doi: 10.3390/ijerph19094991.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/ijerph19094991",NA,2022

Despite the clinical and economic burden of diabetic neuropathy, no effective treatment is available. More preclinical research must be conducted in order to gain further understanding of the aetiology of the disease and elucidate new therapeutic targets. METHODS: The proteome of lumbar dorsal root ganglia and sciatic nerve of BKS-db/db mice, which contain a mutation of the leptin receptor and are an established type 2 diabetes model, was characterized for the first time by tandem mass tag labelling and mass spectrometry analysis. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis showed differentially expressed proteins grouped into functional clusters in db/db peripheral nerves compared to control mice, underlining reduced glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolism, higher lipid catabolism, upregulation of muscle-like proteins in DRG and downregulation in SCN, increased cytoskeleton-related proteins, a mild dysregulation of folding chaperones, activation of acute-phase and inflammatory response, and alterations in glutathione metabolism and oxidative stress related proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Our data validate previous transcriptomic and metabolomic results and uncover new pathways altered in diabetic neuropathy. Our results point out that energetic deficiency could represent the main mechanism of neurodegeneration observed in diabetic neuropathy. These findings may provide important information to select appropriate targets to develop new therapeutic strategies.","Leal-Julià, MarcVilches, Jorge JOnieva, AndreaVerdés, SergiSánchez, ÁngelaChillón, MiguelNavarro, XavierBosch, Assumpció","Leal-Julià MVilches JJOnieva AVerdés SSánchez ÁChillón MNavarro XBosch A","Institute of Neurosciences, Univ.

However, the biologic basis of HFmrEF as an entity distinct from HF with preserved EF (HFpEF) and reduced EF (HFrEF) has not been well characterized. METHODS: The EXSCEL trial randomized participants with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to once-weekly exenatide (EQW) vs. placebo. For this study, profiling of ∼5000 proteins using the SomaLogic SomaScan platform was performed in baseline and 12-month serum samples from N=1199 participants with prevalent HF at baseline. Principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA (FDR p<0.1) were used to determine differences in proteins between three EF groups, as previously curated in EXSCEL (EF>55% [HFpEF], EF 40-55% [HFmrEF], EF<40% [HFrEF]). Cox proportional hazards was used to assess association between baseline levels of significant proteins, and changes in protein level between baseline and 12-month, with time-to-HF hospitalization. Mixed models were used to assess whether significant proteins changed differentially with exenatide vs. placebo therapy. RESULTS: Of N=1199 EXSCEL participants with prevalent HF, 284 (24%), 704 (59%) and 211 (18%) had HFpEF, HFmrEF and HFrEF, respectively. Eight PCA protein factors and 221 individual proteins within these factors differed significantly across the three EF groups. Levels of the majority of proteins (83%) demonstrated concordance between HFmrEF and HFpEF, but higher levels in HFrEF, predominated by the domain of extracellular matrix regulation, e.g. COL28A1 and tenascin C [TNC]; p<0.0001. Concordance between HFmrEF and HFrEF was observed in a minority of proteins (1%) including MMP-9 (p<0.0001). Biologic pathways of epithelial mesenchymal transition, ECM receptor interaction, complement and coagulation cascades, and cytokine receptor interaction demonstrated enrichment among proteins with the dominant pattern, i.e. HFmrEF-HFpEF concordance. Baseline levels of 208 (94%) of the 221 proteins were associated with time-to-incident HF hospitalization including domains of extracellular matrix (COL28A1, TNC), angiogenesis (ANG2, VEGFa, VEGFd), myocyte stretch (NT-proBNP), and renal function (cystatin-C). Change in levels of 10 of the 221 proteins from baseline to 12 months (including increase in TNC) predicted incident HF hospitalization (p<0.05). Levels of 30 of the 221 significant proteins (including TNC, NT-proBNP, ANG2) were reduced differentially by EQW compared with placebo (interaction p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this HF substudy of a large clinical trial of people with T2DM, we found that serum levels of most proteins across multiple biologic domains were similar between HFmrEF and HFpEF. HFmrEF may be more biologically similar to HFpEF than HFrEF, and specific related biomarkers may offer unique data on prognosis and pharmacotherapy modification with variability by EF.","Peters, Anthony ENguyen, MaggieGreen, Jennifer BPearson, Ewan RBuse, JohnSourij, HaraldHernandez, Adrian FSattar, NaveedHolman, Rury RMentz, Robert JShah, Svati H","Peters AEAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4313-030XNguyen MGreen JBPearson ERBuse JSourij HHernandez AFSattar NHolman RRMentz RJShah SH",NA,"eng","P30 DK124723/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticlePreprint","20230516","United States","medRxiv","medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences","101767986",NA,NA,NA,"PMC10246051",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023/06/09 06:42","2023/06/09 06:43","2023/06/07","2023/06/09 04:29","2023/06/09 06:43 [medline]2023/06/09 06:42 [pubmed]2023/06/09 04:29 [entrez]2023/06/07 00:00 [pmc-release]","2023.05.16.23288273 [pii]10.1101/2023.05.16.23288273 [doi]","epublish","medRxiv [Preprint]. 2023 May 16:2023.05.16.23288273. doi: 10.1101/2023.05.16.23288273.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1101/2023.05.16.23288273","2023.05.16.23288273",2023

Correlations between glycometabolic parameters and DEPs were revealed by a network analysis. The expression levels of target genes in key metabolic pathways were further evaluated to identify candidate biomarkers. Among 6810 total proteins, approximately 88 % were quantified, of which 148 DEPs with a fold change of <0.83 or>1.2 and a corrected p-value of <0.05 were identified. A KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the hypoglycaemic effects of E. prolifera oligosaccharide involved the PI3K/AKT and extracellular matrix receptor interaction signaling pathways. More importantly, Col1a1 was the most significant gene in the extracellular matrix receptor interaction pathway and was linked to hypoglycaemic activity for the first time.

METHODS: We adopted the diagnostic criteria for T2DM recommended by ADA for humans: FSG ≥7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dl) and HbA1c ≥ 6.5%. The serum and feces samples from three diagnosed spontaneously T2DM cynomolgus monkeys and 11 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. We employed LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomic methods to reveal the differential metabolite profiles of serum and feces samples between the two groups and to analyze the affected metabolic pathways in MetaboAnalyst 5.0 based on KEGG library. RESULTS: Six and 44 differential metabolites were identified in serum and feces samples, respectively, and the corresponding affected commonly metabolic pathways involved several metabolic ways, such as arginine biosynthesis, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, and histidine metabolism. CONCLUSION: The differential potential serum and feces biomarkers obtained from the LC-MS/MS based untargeted metabolomic may help to explain the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of T2DM and offer pivotal information for the early diagnosis and treatment of DM.","Tian, ChaoyangQiu, MingyinLv, HaizhouYue, FengZhou, Feifan","Tian CAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7985-1793Qiu MLv HYue FZhou F","Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Hainan Province, School of Biomedical Engineering, Hainan University, Haikou, China.One Health Institute, Hainan University, Haikou, China.Hainan Jingang Biotech Co., Ltd, Haikou, China.Hainan Jingang Biotech Co., Ltd, Haikou, China.Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Hainan Province, School of Biomedical Engineering, Hainan University, Haikou, China.One Health Institute, Hainan University, Haikou, China.Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Hainan Province, School of Biomedical Engineering, Hainan University, Haikou, China.One Health Institute, Hainan University, Haikou, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20220822","Denmark","J Med Primatol","Journal of medical primatology","0320626","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","HumansAnimalsChromatography, Liquid/methodsMacaca fascicularis/metabolism*Tandem Mass SpectrometryMetabolomics/methodsFecesBiomarkers*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","LC-MS/MST2DMcynomolgus monkeyfecesmetabolic pathwayserumuntargeted metabolomics",NA,"2022/08/23 06:00","2022/11/16 06:00",NA,"2022/08/22 06:13","2022/08/02 00:00 [revised]2022/01/06 00:00 [received]2022/08/09 00:00 [accepted]2022/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]2022/11/16 06:00 [medline]2022/08/22 06:13 [entrez]","10.1111/jmp.12610 [doi]","ppublish","J Med Primatol. 2022 Dec;51(6):355-366. doi: 10.1111/jmp.12610.

Our previous in vivo and in vitro studies revealed MET's inhibitory effect on ovarian cancer, with the synergistic effects of MET and the MDM2 inhibitor RG7388 contributing to ovarian cancer treatment. This study further explores the mechanism underlying MET's inhibition of ovarian cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following MET treatment, we analyzed the differentially expressed proteins in ovarian cancer cells using a tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomic approach coupled with bioinformatics. RESULTS: Using A2780 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells, we identified six upregulated and two downregulated proteins after MET treatment. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these proteins predominately affect ovarian cancer cells by regulating iron ion transport, iron ion homeostasis, and mitochondrial and ribosomal functions. Validation via western blot confirmed MET-induced elevation of hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase type 2 (BDH2) protein expression levels in A2780 and SKOV3 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that combining MET with other metabolic drugs, such as iron-chelating agents and mitochondrial inhibitors, may result in synergistic antitumor effects, thereby offering novel avenues for ovarian cancer treatment development.","Wang, DongyueWang, JingchenCui, Yingying","Wang DWang JCui Y","Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, China.Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Key Laboratory of Laparoscopic Technology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, China.Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Key Laboratory of Laparoscopic Technology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240829","India","J Cancer Res Ther","Journal of cancer research and therapeutics","101249598","9100L32L2N (Metformin)0 (Proteome)","IM","*Metformin/pharmacologyHumansFemale*Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology*Proteomics/methodsCell Line, TumorTandem Mass SpectrometryComputational Biology/methodsGene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effectsCell Proliferation/drug effectsProteome/analysis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024/08/31 09:48","2024/09/01 16:16",NA,"2024/08/29 08:03","2023/11/13 00:00 [received]2024/06/03 00:00 [accepted]2024/09/01 16:16 [medline]2024/08/31 09:48 [pubmed]2024/08/29 08:03 [entrez]","01363817-202420040-00022 [pii]10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_2449_23 [doi]","ppublish","J Cancer Res Ther. 2024 Aug 1;20(4):1293-1299. doi: 10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_2449_23.

We hypothesized that those biomarkers indicative of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) seen in large vessel occlusion (LVO) may also be elevated in T2D and further enhanced by stress conditions; therefore, these proteins represent potentially predictive biomarkers for those T2D patients at high risk of AIS. Methods: We performed an exploratory proteomic analysis in control subjects (n = 23) versus those with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (n = 23) who underwent a hyperinsulinemic clamp study to transient severe hypoglycemia [blood glucose <2.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dl)] in a prospective case-control study. We compared these proteins described as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for AIS due to LVO: lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor-1 (LYVE1), thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP), and cadherin 1 (CDH1). Results: At baseline (BL), PPBP (p < 0.05), THBS1 (p < 0.05), and CDH1 (p < 0.01) were elevated in T2D; LYVE1 was not different between controls and T2D subjects at BL or at subsequent timepoints. PPBP and THBS1 tended to increase at hypoglycemia in both cohorts, though reached significance only in controls (p < 0.05), returning to BL levels post-hypoglycemia. CDH1 levels were higher in T2D at BL, at hypoglycemia and up to 2-h posthypoglycemia, thereafter reverting to BL levels. Conclusion: Elevated levels of PPBP, THBS1, and CDH1, circulatory proteins suggested as biomarkers of AIS due to LVO, may, in T2D patients, be prognostically indicative of a cohort of T2D patients at increased risk of ischaemic stroke. Prospective studies are needed to determine if this reflects future clinical risk.

However, there is still a lack of ideal tumor markers for HCC detection in the T2DM population. Serum lipids have been revealed as potential tumor markers for HCC. In this study, our objective was to develop a novel liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to detect several lipids including 8,15-dihydroxy-5,9,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (8,15-DiHETE), hexadecanedioic acid (HDA), 15-keto-13,14-dihydroprostaglandin A2 (DHK-PGA2), ricinoleic acid (RCL), octadecanedioic acid (OA) and 16-hydroxy hexadecanoic acid (16OHHA) in serum and explore their diagnostic potential for T2DM-positive [T2DM(+)] HCC. A robust LC-MS/MS method was established for the measurement of 8,15-DiHETE, HDA, DHK-PGA2, RCL, OA, and 16OHHA. The methodology validation was conducted, and the results suggested the reliability of this LC-MS/MS method for targeted lipids. Several serum lipids, including 8,15-DiHETE, HDA, DHK-PGA2, and OA were increased in T2DM(+) HCC patients. A biomarker signature that incorporated HDA, DHK-PGA2, and AFP was established and showed good diagnostic potential for T2DM(+) HCC, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.87 for diagnosing T2DM(+) HCC from T2DM individuals. Additionally, the biomarker signature diagnosed small-size (AUC = 0.88) and early-stage (AUC = 0.79) tumors with high efficacy. Moreover, the biomarker signature could differentiate T2DM(+) HCC from other T2DM(+) tumors, including pancreatic, gastric and colorectal cancer (AUC = 0.88) as well. In conclusion, our study develops a novel tool for early diagnosis of T2DM(+) HCC in T2DM patients.","Yue, ZhihongPei, LinMeng, GuangyanZhang, AiminLi, MengJia, MeiWang, HuiCao, Linlin","Yue ZPei LMeng GZhang ALi MJia MWang HCao L","Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Diabetes Center, Beijing 100044, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.","eng","RDJP2022-57/Peking University People's Hospital Scientific Research Development Funds/","Journal Article","20230106","Switzerland","Metabolites","Metabolites","101578790",NA,NA,NA,"PMC9865394",NA,"NOTNLM","15-keto-13,14-dihydroprostaglandin A2biomarker signaturehepatocellular cancerhexadecanedioic acidserum lipidstype 2 diabetes mellitus","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","2023/01/22 06:00","2023/01/22 06:01","2023/01/06","2023/01/21 01:39","2022/11/20 00:00 [received]2022/12/16 00:00 [revised]2022/12/21 00:00 [accepted]2023/01/21 01:39 [entrez]2023/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]2023/01/22 06:01 [medline]2023/01/06 00:00 [pmc-release]","metabo13010090 [pii]metabolites-13-00090 [pii]10.3390/metabo13010090 [doi]","epublish","Metabolites. 2023 Jan 6;13(1):90. doi: 10.3390/metabo13010090.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/metabo13010090",NA,2023

METHODS: We used a Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics approach to identify proteins with potential molecular mechanisms associated with acupuncture interventions for T2DM with NAFLD. RESULTS: Acupuncture effectively improved body weight, blood glucose, and insulin levels in T2DM with NAFLD mouse models and reversed steatosis within hepatocytes. Quantitative TMT-based proteomics analysis identified a total of 4710 quantifiable proteins and 1226 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the model control group (MCG) compared with the normal control group (NCG). The Acupuncture Treatment Group (ATG) presented in 122 DEPs was compared with the MCG group. We performed a bioinformatics analysis, which revealed that DEPs enriched in the KEGG pathway after acupuncture treatment were mainly involved in the PPAR signaling pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid elongation, fat digestion and absorption. We used parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) technology to explore the association of aldehyde oxidase 1 (Aox1), acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 2 (Acot2), perilipin-2 (Plin2), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (Acc), NADP-dependent malic enzyme (Me1), fatty acid synthase (Fasn), ATP-citrate synthase (Acly), fatty acid-binding protein, intestinal (Fabp2) with lipid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, and hepatocyte steatosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that acupuncture can regulate the protein expression of T2DM in the NAFLD mice model, and can effectively improve hepatocyte steatosis, and has potential benefits for the clinical treatment of this disease.","Wang, GuanLi, MengyuanYu, ShuoGuan, MengqiMa, ShiqiZhong, ZhenGuo, YihuiLeng, XiangyangHuang, Haipeng","Wang GLi MYu SGuan MMa SZhong ZGuo YLeng XAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5278-4001Huang HAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5375-7558","College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China.College of Acupuncture and Massage, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130117, China.College of Acupuncture and Massage, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130117, China.College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China.College of Acupuncture and Massage, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130117, China.College of Acupuncture and Massage, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130117, China.College of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China.College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China.College of Acupuncture and Massage, Changchun University of Chinese Medicine, Changchun, 130117, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"England","Biosci Rep","Bioscience reports","8102797",NA,"IM","*Acupuncture TherapyAnimals*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/genetics/therapyLipid Metabolism/geneticsLiver/metabolismMice*Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/genetics/metabolism/therapyProteomics","PMC8762347",NA,"NOTNLM","glucose and lipid metabolismhepatocyte steatosisinsulin resistancenonalcoholic fatty liver diseaseproteomicstype 2 diabetes mellitus","The authors declare that there are no competing interests associated with the manuscript.","2022/01/05 06:00","2022/02/11 06:00","2022/01/14","2022/01/04 06:10","2021/09/23 00:00 [received]2021/12/01 00:00 [revised]2021/12/23 00:00 [accepted]2022/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]2022/02/11 06:00 [medline]2022/01/04 06:10 [entrez]2022/01/14 00:00 [pmc-release]","230596 [pii]BSR20212248 [pii]10.1042/BSR20212248 [doi]","ppublish","Biosci Rep. 2022 Jan 28;42(1):BSR20212248. doi: 10.1042/BSR20212248.","© 2022 The Author(s).",NA,NA,"10.1042/BSR20212248",NA,2022

Current selective screening strategies rely on clinical risk factors such as age, family history of diabetes, macrosomia or GDM in a previous pregnancy, and they possess a relatively low specificity. Here we hypothesize that novel first trimester protein predictors of GDM can contribute to the current selective screening strategies for early and accurate prediction of GDM, thus allowing for timely interventions. METHODS: A proteomics discovery approach was applied to first trimester sera from obese (BMI ≥27 kg/m2) women (n = 60) in a nested case-control study design, utilizing tandem mass tag labelling and tandem mass spectrometry. A subset of the identified protein markers was further validated in a second set of serum samples (n = 210) and evaluated for their contribution as predictors of GDM in relation to the maternal risk factors, by use of logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: Serum proteomic profiling identified 25 proteins with significantly different levels between cases and controls. Three proteins; afamin, serum amyloid P-component and vitronectin could be further confirmed as predictors of GDM in a validation set. Vitronectin was shown to contribute significantly to the predictive power of the maternal risk factors, indicating it as a novel independent predictor of GDM.

Our study integrates proteomics and metabolomics analyses to delineate the complex molecular landscapes associated with T2D and obesity. Leveraging data from 130 subjects, including individuals with T2D and obesity as well as healthy controls, we elucidate distinct molecular signatures and identify novel biomarkers indicative of disease progression. Our comprehensive characterization of cardiometabolic proteins and serum metabolites unveils intricate networks of biomolecular interactions and highlights differential protein expression patterns between T2D and obesity cohorts. Pathway enrichment analyses reveal unique mechanisms underlying disease development and progression, while correlation analyses elucidate the interplay between proteomics, metabolomics, and clinical parameters.

Identifying the risk of CHD in T2DM patients is important for early clinical intervention. METHODS: A total of 213 participants, including 81 healthy controls (HCs), 69 T2DM patients and 63 T2DM patients complicated with CHD were recruited in this study. Serum metabolomics were conducted by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Demographic information and clinical laboratory test results were also collected. RESULTS: Metabolic phenotypes were significantly altered among HC, T2DM and T2DM-CHD. Acylcarnitines were the most disturbed metabolites between T2DM patients and HCs. Lower levels of bile acids and higher levels of fatty acids in serum were closely associated with CHD risk in T2DM patients. Artificial neural network model was constructed for the discrimination of T2DM and T2DM complicated with CHD based on myristic acid, palmitic acid and heptanoylcarnitine, with accuracy larger than 0.95 in both training set and testing set. CONCLUSION: Altogether, these findings suggest that myristic acid, palmitic acid and heptanoylcarnitine have a good prospect for the warning of CHD complications in T2DM patients, and are superior to traditional lipid, blood glucose and blood pressure indicators.","Hu, TingZhang, WenHan, FeifeiZhao, RuiLiu, HongchuanAn, Zhuoling","Hu TZhang WHan FZhao RLiu HAn Z","Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, No.8 Gongti South Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100020, PR China.

Single-anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S) is one of the most effective metabolic surgeries for T2DM. However, the molecular mechanisms behind the SADI-S-induced T2DM improvement are not fully understood.Here,T2DM rats received SADI-S and were sacrificed after 8 weeks; the controls received sham surgery; Liver tissues were collected for transcriptomics and proteomics analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and proteins (DEPs). Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was performed to validate the accuracy of the proteomics results.SADI-S significantly improved glucose metabolism in T2DM rats.A total of 120 genes/proteins(e.g., phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) and pyruvate kinase (Pklr)) exhibited consistent expression trends at both mRNA and protein levels. Among the upregulated genes/proteins involved in glucose metabolic pathways, enrichment was observed in pathways such as the pyruvate metabolic pathway, insulin signaling pathway, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis biological processes, glucagon signaling pathway, and AMPK signaling pathway. Downregulated genes/proteins were enriched in the pyruvate metabolic pathway. The above-mentioned signaling pathways are implicated in glucose metabolism, suggesting a potential mechanism for SADI-S-mediated alleviation of T2DM. The PRM validation results indicated that all selected proteins showed consistent trends between PRM and proteomics data. This consistency suggests the reliability of the proteomics results.","Wang, LunChen, ZhengfuMa, SuboJiang, Tao","Wang LAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-0232-9294Chen ZMa SJiang T","Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000,China.Department of Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033,China.Department of Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033,China.Department of Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033,China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20241105","United States","J Proteome Res","Journal of proteome research","101128775","IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)EC 4.1.1.32 (Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (GTP))EC 4.1.1.32 (Pck1 protein, rat)EC 2.7.1.40 (Pyruvate Kinase)0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)","IM","Animals*Liver/metabolism*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolism/genetics*Proteomics/methodsRats*Glucose/metabolismMaleTranscriptomePhosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (GTP)/metabolism/geneticsGene Expression Profiling/methodsGastrectomyDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental/metabolism/geneticsPyruvate Kinase/metabolism/geneticsSignal Transduction/geneticsRats, Sprague-DawleyMetabolic Networks and Pathways/geneticsIntracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","SADI-STranscriptomicsproteomicssingle-anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomytype 2 diabetes mellitus",NA,"2024/11/05 19:20","2024/12/06 06:24",NA,"2024/11/05 08:42","2024/12/06 06:24 [medline]2024/11/05 19:20 [pubmed]2024/11/05 08:42 [entrez]","10.1021/acs.jproteome.4c00532 [doi]","ppublish","J Proteome Res. 2024 Dec 6;23(12):5380-5394. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.4c00532.

In particular, cell omics technologies may provide innovative biomarkers for the identification of rare specific progenitor cell subpopulations, assess transcriptional and proteomic changes affecting cell proliferation and immunomodulatory potential, and accurately define the lineage hierarchy and differentiation status of progenitor cells. Unraveling adipose tissue complexity may also provide for the precise assessment of a dysfunctional state, which has been associated with cancer, as cancer-associated adipocytes play an important role in shaping the tumor microenvironment supporting tumor progression and metastasis, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The information collected by single-cell omics has relevant implications for regenerative medicine because adipose tissue is an accessible source of multipotent cells; alternative cell-free approaches, including the use of adipose tissue stromal cell-conditioned medium, extracellular vesicles, or decellularized extracellular matrix, are clinically valid options. Subcutaneous white adipose tissue, which is generally harvested via liposuction, is highly heterogeneous because of intrinsic biological variability and extrinsic inconsistencies in the harvesting and processing procedures. The current limited understanding of adipose tissue heterogeneity impinges on the definition of quality standards appropriate for clinical translation, which requires consistency and uniformity of the administered product. We review the methods used for dissecting adipose tissue heterogeneity and provide an overview of advances in omics technology that may contribute to the exploration of heterogeneity and dynamics of adipose tissue at the single-cell level.","Di Rocco, GiulianaTrivisonno, AngeloTrivisonno, GiovanniToietta, Gabriele","Di Rocco GTrivisonno ATrivisonno GToietta GAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4182-2468","Unit of Cellular Networks and Molecular Therapeutic Targets, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, 00144, Rome, Italy.Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS, 00168, Rome, Italy.School of Medicine, University of Rome Campus Biomedico, 00128, Rome, Italy.Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Via E.

Tomosyn proteins are negative regulators of exocytosis. Tomosyn causes an attenuation of insulin secretion by limiting the formation of the SNARE complex. We hypothesized that glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion from β-cells must involve reversing the inhibitory action of tomosyn. Here, we show that glucose increases tomosyn protein turnover. Within 1 h of exposure to 15 mM glucose, ~50% of tomosyn was degraded. The degradation of tomosyn in response to high glucose was blocked by inhibitors of the proteasomal pathway. Using (32)P labeling and mass spectrometry, we showed that tomosyn-2 is phosphorylated in response to high glucose, phorbol esters, and analogs of cAMP, all key insulin secretagogues. We identified 11 phosphorylation sites in tomosyn-2. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate phosphomimetic (Ser → Asp) and loss-of-function (Ser → Ala) mutants. The Ser → Asp mutant had enhanced protein turnover compared with the Ser → Ala mutant and wild type tomosyn-2. Additionally, the Ser → Asp tomosyn-2 mutant was ineffective at inhibiting insulin secretion. Using a proteomic screen for tomosyn-2-binding proteins, we identified Hrd-1, an E3-ubiquitin ligase. We showed that tomosyn-2 ubiquitination is increased by Hrd-1, and knockdown of Hrd-1 by short hairpin RNA resulted in increased abundance in tomosyn-2 protein levels. Taken together, our results reveal a mechanism by which enhanced phosphorylation of a negative regulator of secretion, tomosyn-2, in response to insulin secretagogues targets it to degradation by the Hrd-1 E3-ubiquitin ligase.","Bhatnagar, SushantSoni, Mufaddal SWrighton, Lindsay SHebert, Alexander SZhou, Amber SPaul, Pradyut KGregg, TrillianRabaglia, Mary EKeller, Mark PCoon, Joshua JAttie, Alan D","Bhatnagar SSoni MSWrighton LSHebert ASZhou ASPaul PKGregg TRabaglia MEKeller MPCoon JJAttie AD","From the Departments of Biochemistry and.From the Departments of Biochemistry and.From the Departments of Biochemistry and.Chemistry and Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706.From the Departments of Biochemistry and.From the Departments of Biochemistry and.From the Departments of Biochemistry and.From the Departments of Biochemistry and.From the Departments of Biochemistry and.Chemistry and Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706.From the Departments of Biochemistry and adattie@wisc.edu.","eng","R01 DK058037/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR00 DK095975/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesDK066369/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR01 DK066369/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesDK58037/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesK99 DK095975/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., Extramural","20140707","United States","J Biol Chem","The Journal of biological chemistry","2985121R","0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)0 (Insulin)0 (R-SNARE Proteins)0 (STXBP5L protein, mouse)452VLY9402 (Serine)EC 2.3.2.27 (SYVN1 protein, human)EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IM","Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular TransportAnimalsBinding Sites/geneticsCell Line, TumorCells, CulturedGlucose/pharmacologyHEK293 CellsHumansImmunoblottingInsulin/*metabolismInsulin SecretionInsulin-Secreting Cells/drug effects/*metabolismMiceModels, MolecularMutationPhosphorylation/drug effectsProtein BindingProtein Structure, TertiaryProteolysis/drug effectsR-SNARE Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolismRNA InterferenceSerine/chemistry/genetics/*metabolismUbiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/metabolismUbiquitination/drug effects","PMC4155689",NA,"NOTNLM","DiabetesInsulinInsulin SecretionSNARE ProteinsType 2 Diabetes",NA,"2014/07/09 06:00","2015/01/30 06:00","2015/09/05","2014/07/09 06:00","2014/07/09 06:00 [entrez]2014/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]2015/09/05 00:00 [pmc-release]","S0021-9258(20)31676-8 [pii]M114.575985 [pii]10.1074/jbc.M114.575985 [doi]","ppublish","J Biol Chem. 2014 Sep 5;289(36):25276-86. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.575985.

This study aimed to explore the complement system, as well as cortisol and ACTH responses in patients with post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study recruited 31 patients with PCC and T2DM (PCC-T2DM), 19 patients with PCC (PCC), 10 patients with T2DM (T2DM), and 10 healthy participants (control). Cortisol and ACTH in the PCC and PCC-T2DM groups were assessed using the insulin tolerance test. In the fasting state, serum samples were collected for proteomic analyses. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between proteins and cortisol, as well as between proteins and ACTH. RESULTS: Cortisol and ACTH levels were consistently decreased in the PCC and PCC-T2DM groups. Proteomic analyses revealed that most of the differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in the PCC vs control and PCC-T2DM vs T2DM were involved in the coagulation and complement cascade, and the essential complement C3 was significantly upregulated in the PCC and PCC-T2DM groups when compared to their controls. Additionally, complement-related DAPs in the PCC vs control and PCC-T2DM vs T2DM were significantly correlated with cortisol and ACTH levels. In comparing PCC-T2DM samples with PCC samples, we found that upregulated DAPs were linked to the complement system and other immune system, and most DAPs were negatively correlated with cortisol and ACTH. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that T2DM exacerbated dysregulation of the complement system in patients with PCC, and significant correlations were present between complement protein levels and those of cortisol and ACTH. These results provide novel insights into the dysregulation of complement and endocrine hormones in patients with PCC and T2DM.","Ji, WenruiXie, XiaominBai, GuirongFan, YaleiHe, YantingZhang, LiZhou, HaiyanLi, LingQiang, DanLi, Huan","Ji WXie XAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6030-7915Bai GFan YHe YZhang LZhou HLi LQiang DLi H","Department of Endocrinology, the First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, 750001, People's Republic of China.Department of Endocrinology, the First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, 750001, People's Republic of China.Department of Endocrinology, the First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, 750001, People's Republic of China.The Second Clinical Medical School of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750001, People's Republic of China.Department of Endocrinology, the First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, 750001, People's Republic of China.Department of Endocrinology, the First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, 750001, People's Republic of China.Department of Endocrinology, the First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, 750001, People's Republic of China.Department of Endocrinology, the First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, 750001, People's Republic of China.Department of Endocrinology, the First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, 750001, People's Republic of China.Department of Endocrinology, the First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, 750001, People's Republic of China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20241019","New Zealand","Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes","Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy","101515585",NA,NA,NA,"PMC11499617",NA,"NOTNLM","adrenocorticotropin hormonecomplementcortisolpost-COVID-19 conditiontype 2 diabetes mellitus","The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.","2024/10/25 06:24","2024/10/25 06:25","2024/10/19","2024/10/25 04:17","2024/05/29 00:00 [received]2024/10/01 00:00 [accepted]2024/10/25 06:25 [medline]2024/10/25 06:24 [pubmed]2024/10/25 04:17 [entrez]2024/10/19 00:00 [pmc-release]","480457 [pii]10.2147/DMSO.S480457 [doi]","epublish","Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes. 2024 Oct 19;17:3849-3861. doi: 10.2147/DMSO.S480457. eCollection 2024.","© 2024 Ji et al.",NA,NA,"10.2147/DMSO.S480457",NA,2024

Here, we investigated the plasma concentrations of FFA alone and in combination with protein glycation as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of T2DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EDTA-plasma obtained from 48 newly diagnosed male T2DM patients, 48 long-term controlled (24 male and 24 female) T2DM patients, 20 prediabetic male T2DM patients and two age-matched control cohorts (48 non-diabetic (ND) men; 24 male and 24 female ND partipants) were analysed for a set of clinical parameters including FFA. Glycation sites were quantified after tryptic digestion using tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Median plasma concentrations of FFA were almost three-fold higher in samples obtained from newly diagnosed (long-term controlled) T2DM patients than in those obtained from the control group, providing diagnostic sensitivity (SN) of 92% (85%) and specificity (SP) of 90% (88%). When combined with the glycation level of lysine-141 of haptoglobin, diagnostic accuracy improved further for newly diagnosed (SN, 94%; SP 96%) and long-term controlled (SN, 85%; SP, 94%) T2DM patients (HbA1c: SN, 88%; SP, 96%). A prospective pilot study evaluating the prognostic value revealed initially low FFA levels for pre-diabetic patients that increased in the following four years in patients whose prediabetic state worsened or who developed T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: FFA levels are elevated in newly diagnosed and long-term controlled T2DM patients, providing high diagnostic accuracy of 87% and 91%, respectively, which improved further when combined with the glycation degree of lysine-141 in haptoglobin. Additionally, FFA showed higher mean fold-changes than HbA1c or FPG in subjects developing T2DM, indicating higher sensitivity towards the progression of the disease.","Spiller, SandroBlüher, MatthiasHoffmann, Ralf","Spiller SBlüher MHoffmann RAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9932-5646","Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy, Universität Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.Center for Biotechnology and Biomedicine (BBZ), Universität Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.University Hospital Leipzig, Department of Internal Medicine, Endocrinology and Nephrology, Universität Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy, Universität Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.Center for Biotechnology and Biomedicine (BBZ), Universität Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20180730","England","Diabetes Obes Metab","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","100883645","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)0 (HP protein, human)0 (Haptoglobins)","IM","AdultBiomarkers/*bloodBlood Glucose/metabolismCase-Control StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/*diagnosisFatty Acids, Nonesterified/*bloodFemaleHaptoglobins/metabolismHumansMaleMiddle AgedPilot ProjectsPrediabetic State/blood/diagnosisPredictive Value of TestsSensitivity and Specificity",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","biomarkerfree fatty acids (FFA)glycation sitesnon-esterified fatty acids (NEFA)plasma proteinsprotein glycationtype 2 diabetes mellitus",NA,"2018/06/27 06:00","2019/04/16 06:00",NA,"2018/06/27 06:00","2018/01/31 00:00 [received]2018/06/21 00:00 [revised]2018/06/22 00:00 [accepted]2018/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]2018/06/27 06:00 [entrez]","10.1111/dom.13449 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes Obes Metab. 2018 Nov;20(11):2661-2669. doi: 10.1111/dom.13449.

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to identify plasma exosome differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that are potentially involved in the development of obesity-related T2DM. METHODS: Exosomes were isolated from the plasma of obese and non-obese T2DM patients (n = 10 for each group). A label-free quantitative mass spectrometry analysis was applied to identify plasma exosome DEPs in obese patients compared with non-obese patients, followed by bioinformatics analysis including GO annotation, KEGG analysis, subcellular localization prediction, transcription factor analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction. RESULTS: We identified 2 significantly upregulated proteins (C9 and PON1) and 5 significantly downregulated proteins (HPX, A1BG, CFHR1, ANG, and CALM) in obese patients compared with those in non-obese patients. KEGG analysis demonstrated that the insulin signaling pathway was one of the pathways that significantly correlated with the DEPs. The DEPs were primarily localized in the extracellular space (5 out of 7). HMG-box and NF-Y beta might regulate the transcription of the DEPs. C9, PON1, HPX, and CFHR1 were present in the PPI network. CONCLUSION: The plasma exosome DEPs are potentially responsible for the development of obesity-related T2DM possibly through the insulin signaling pathway and the interaction with other proteins. Our study may guide future research direction toward the pathogenesis of obesity-related T2DM.","Wang, YanjunWu, YouYang, ShuangzhuChen, Yan","Wang YWu YYang SChen YAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9302-3962","Department of Endocrinology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China.Department of Endocrinology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China.Department of Endocrinology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China.Department of Endocrinology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20230307","New Zealand","Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes","Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy","101515585",NA,NA,NA,"PMC10008006",NA,"NOTNLM","exosomesinsulin resistancemass spectrometryobesityproteomicstype 2 diabetes mellitus","The authors declare that they have no competing interests in this work.","2023/03/15 06:00","2023/03/15 06:01","2023/03/07","2023/03/14 02:06","2022/11/11 00:00 [received]2023/02/24 00:00 [accepted]2023/03/14 02:06 [entrez]2023/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]2023/03/15 06:01 [medline]2023/03/07 00:00 [pmc-release]","396239 [pii]10.2147/DMSO.S396239 [doi]","epublish","Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes. 2023 Mar 7;16:629-642. doi: 10.2147/DMSO.S396239. eCollection 2023.","© 2023 Wang et al.",NA,NA,"10.2147/DMSO.S396239",NA,2023

Senescent cell accumulation contributes to aging and many pathologies including chronic inflammation, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Targeted removal of senescent cells in preclinical models promotes health and longevity, suggesting that the selective elimination of senescent cells is a promising therapeutic approach for mitigating a myriad of age-related pathologies in humans. However, moving senescence-targeting drugs (senotherapeutics) into the clinic will require therapeutic targets and biomarkers, fueled by an improved understanding of the complex and dynamic biology of senescent cell populations and their molecular profiles, as well as the mechanisms underlying the emergence and maintenance of senescence cells and the SASP. Advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies and workflows have the potential to address these needs. Here, we review the state of translational senescence research and how proteomic approaches have added to our knowledge of senescence biology to date. Further, we lay out a roadmap from fundamental biological discovery to the clinical translation of senotherapeutic approaches through the development and application of emerging proteomic technologies, including targeted and untargeted proteomic approaches, bottom-up and top-down methods, stability proteomics, and surfaceomics. These technologies are integral for probing the cellular composition and dynamics of senescent cells and, ultimately, the development of senotype-specific biomarkers and senotherapeutics (senolytics and senomorphics). This review aims to highlight emerging areas and applications of proteomics that will aid in exploring new senescent cell biology and the future translation of senotherapeutics.","Dey, Amit KBanarjee, ReemaBoroumand, MozhganRutherford, Delaney VStrassheim, QuinnNyunt, ThedoeOlinger, BradleyBasisty, Nathan","Dey AKAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3106-7091Banarjee RAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-0161-0188Boroumand MAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-3239-4775Rutherford DVAUID ORCID: 0009-0002-4088-9281Strassheim QAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2933-1930Nyunt TAUID ORCID: 0009-0002-5282-9411Olinger BAUID ORCID: 0009-0007-6196-4443Basisty NAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6173-1139","Translational Geroproteomics Unit, Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.Translational Geroproteomics Unit, Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.Translational Geroproteomics Unit, Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.Translational Geroproteomics Unit, Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.Translational Geroproteomics Unit, Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.Translational Geroproteomics Unit, Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.Translational Geroproteomics Unit, Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.Translational Geroproteomics Unit, Translational Gerontology Branch, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.","eng","U54 AG079779/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesNIA U54 AG079779/NH/NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleReview","20231002","Switzerland","Biology (Basel)","Biology","101587988",NA,NA,NA,"PMC10604147",NA,"NOTNLM","CETSASASPTPPagingbiomarkersdrug discoverygerosciencemass spectrometryproteomicssenescencesenolyticssenomorphicssenotherapeuticssurfaceome","The authors have declared that no conflicts of interest exist.","2023/10/27 12:42","2023/10/27 12:43","2023/10/02","2023/10/27 06:51","2023/09/01 00:00 [received]2023/09/25 00:00 [revised]2023/09/28 00:00 [accepted]2023/10/27 12:43 [medline]2023/10/27 12:42 [pubmed]2023/10/27 06:51 [entrez]2023/10/02 00:00 [pmc-release]","biology12101301 [pii]biology-12-01301 [pii]10.3390/biology12101301 [doi]","epublish","Biology (Basel). 2023 Oct 2;12(10):1301. doi: 10.3390/biology12101301.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/biology12101301",NA,2023

This study aimed to explore the mechanisms of early-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by analyzing proteomic changes at different stages of glucose metabolism. METHODS: A total of 40 individuals undergoing routine physical health examinations between December 2016 and April 2017 were enrolled. Subjects were divided into four groups based on fasting blood glucose (FPG) levels: FPG < 5.6 mmol/L (group A); FPG ≥ 5.6 mmol/L and <6.1 mmol/L (group B); FPG ≥ 6.1 mmol/L and <7.0 mmol/L (group C); and FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (group D). Each group had 10 cases. Sera from these 40 subjects were analyzed by label-free quantitative liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). LC/MS/MS with selected reaction monitoring mode was also performed for qualitative and quantitative metabolomics analysis. Differentially expressed proteins were identified. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to analyze the differentially expressed metabolites. RESULTS: A total of 202 differentially expressed proteins were screened and were identified as mainly secreted proteins. Comparing group A with group B, 32 proteins were up-regulated and 18 proteins were down-regulated. Comparing group A with group C, 24 proteins were up-regulated and 24 proteins were down-regulated. Comparing group A with group D, 19 proteins were up-regulated and 17 proteins were down-regulated. The fold change for up-regulated proteins was >1.2, p < 0.05, while the fold change for down-regulated proteins was <-1.2, p < 0.05. PLS-DA and OPLS-DA revealed 113 differentially expressed metabolites. Correlation analysis of differentially expressed metabolites of group A versus group B revealed that among the down-regulated differential proteins, transforming growth factor β-induced protein ig-h3 correlated negatively with metabolite L-saccharin, while among the up-regulated differential proteins, apolipoprotein C-IV correlated negatively with metabolite 3-methyloxindole. Among all differentially expressed proteins, 19 proteins were associated with early initiation of chronic inflammation, including CD14 and CSF-1R, which were newly identified in the early onset of T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: Many proteins are differentially expressed between prediabetes and after T2DM diagnosis, although the specific mechanism remains unclear. The expression level of CD14 was significantly up-regulated and that of CSF-1R was significantly down-regulated when FPG was ≥5.6 mmol/L, suggesting that CD14 and CSF-1R may be important markers for early-onset T2DM and may serve as new targets for T2DM treatment.","Li, HuanXie, XiaominLiu, HuiliZhang, LiQiang, DanLi, LingHe, Yan TingBai, Guirong","Li HXie XAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2109-0063Liu HZhang LQiang DLi LHe YTBai G","Department of Endocrinology, First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, China.Department of Endocrinology, First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, China.Department of Endocrinology, First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, China.Department of Endocrinology, First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, China.Department of Endocrinology, First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, China.Department of Endocrinology, First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, China.Department of Endocrinology, First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, China.Department of Endocrinology, First People's Hospital of Yinchuan, Yinchuan, China.","eng","2019-49/Ningxia Science and Technology Department Central Guiding Local Science and Technology Development Special Project/","Journal Article",NA,"England","Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom","Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM","8802365",NA,"IM","Humans*Prediabetic State*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolismTandem Mass Spectrometry/methodsProteomics/methodsMetabolomics/methods",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2022/12/03 06:00","2023/02/08 06:00",NA,"2022/12/02 19:32","2022/11/11 00:00 [revised]2022/04/07 00:00 [received]2022/11/25 00:00 [accepted]2022/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]2023/02/08 06:00 [medline]2022/12/02 19:32 [entrez]","10.1002/rcm.9448 [doi]","ppublish","Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom. 2023 Mar 15;37(5):e9448. doi: 10.1002/rcm.9448.","© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",NA,NA,"10.1002/rcm.9448",NA,2023

Although the beneficial effects of SGLT2i have been demonstrated, their target mechanisms on kidney function are unknown. The current study aimed to elucidate these mechanisms by studying SGLT2i-induced changes in the urinary proteome of persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and DKD. METHODS: A total of 40 participants with T2D were enrolled in a double-blinded randomized cross-over trial at the Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Denmark. They were treated with 10 mg of dapagliflozin for 12 weeks. Thirty-two participants with complete urinary proteomics measures before and after the trial were included. All participants received renin-angiotensin system blockade and had albuminuria, (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] ≥30 mg/g). A type 1 diabetes (T1D) cohort consisting of healthy controls and persons with DKD was included for validation. Urinary proteome changes were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted to discover affected biological processes. RESULTS: Dapagliflozin treatment significantly (P(adjusted) < 0.05) affected 36 urinary peptide fragments derived from 19 proteins. Eighteen proteins were correspondingly reflected in the validation cohort. A multifold change in peptide abundance was observed in many proteins (A1BG, urinary albumin [ALB], Caldesmon 1, COLCRNN, heat shock protein 90-β [HSP90AB1], IGLL5, peptidase inhibitor 16 [PI16], prostaglandin-H2-D-isomerase [PTGDS], SERPINA1). These also included urinary biomarkers of kidney fibrosis and function (type I and III collagens and albumin). Biological processes relating to inflammation, wound healing, and kidney fibrosis were enriched. CONCLUSION: The current study discovers the urinary proteome impacted by the SGLT2i, thereby providing new potential target sites and pathways, especially relating to wound healing and inflammation.","Ahluwalia, Tarunveer SRönkkö, Teemu K EEickhoff, Mie KCurovic, Viktor RotbainSiwy, JustynaEder, SusanneDenicolò, SaraMayer, GertMischak, HaraldRossing, PeterPersson, Frederik","Ahluwalia TSRönkkö TKEEickhoff MKCurovic VRSiwy JEder SDenicolò SMayer GMischak HRossing PPersson F","Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Herlev, Denmark.The Bioinformatics Center, Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Herlev, Denmark.Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Herlev, Denmark.Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Herlev, Denmark.Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH, Hannover, Germany.Department of Internal Medicine IV (Nephrology and Hypertension), Medical University Innsbruck, Austria.Department of Internal Medicine IV (Nephrology and Hypertension), Medical University Innsbruck, Austria.Department of Internal Medicine IV (Nephrology and Hypertension), Medical University Innsbruck, Austria.Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH, Hannover, Germany.Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Herlev, Denmark.Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Herlev, Denmark.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20231129","United States","Kidney Int Rep","Kidney international reports","101684752",NA,NA,NA,"PMC10851015",NA,"NOTNLM","SGLT2dapagliflozindiabetic kidney diseaserandomized controlled trialsodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitorsurinary proteomics",NA,"2024/02/12 15:42","2024/02/12 15:43","2023/11/29","2024/02/12 04:27","2023/05/12 00:00 [received]2023/10/29 00:00 [revised]2023/11/20 00:00 [accepted]2024/02/12 15:43 [medline]2024/02/12 15:42 [pubmed]2024/02/12 04:27 [entrez]2023/11/29 00:00 [pmc-release]","S2468-0249(23)01608-X [pii]10.1016/j.ekir.2023.11.020 [doi]","epublish","Kidney Int Rep. 2023 Nov 29;9(2):334-346. doi: 10.1016/j.ekir.2023.11.020. eCollection 2024 Feb.","© 2023 International Society of Nephrology.

Research has shown that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, particularly SBC-115076, have a protective effect against various neurodegenerative diseases. However, their role in DACD remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to explore the impact of PCSK9 inhibitors on DACD. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used to establish an animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The rats were randomly divided into three groups: the Control group (Control, healthy rats, n = 8), the Model group (Model, rats with T2DM, n = 8), and the PCSK9 inhibitor-treated group (Treat, T2DM rats treated with PCSK9 inhibitors, n = 8). To assess the spatial learning and memory of the rats in each group, the Morris water maze (MWM) test was conducted. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and Nissl staining procedures were performed to assess the structural characteristics and functional status of the neurons of rats from each group. Transmission electron microscopy was used to examine the morphology and structure of the hippocampal neurons. Determine serum PCSK9 and lipid metabolism indicators in each group of rats. Use qRT-PCR to detect the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the hippocampal tissues of each group of rats. Western blot was used to detect the expression of PCSK9 and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in the hippocampal tissues of rats. In addition, a 4D label-free quantitative proteomics approach was used to analyse protein expression in rat hippocampal tissues. The expression of selected proteins in hippocampal tissues was verified by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: The results showed that the PCSK9 inhibitor alleviated cognitive dysfunction in T2DM rats. PCSK9 inhibitors can reduce PCSK9, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in the serum of T2DM rats. Meanwhile, it was found that PCSK9 inhibitors can reduce the expression of PCSK9, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the hippocampal tissues of T2DM rats, while increasing the expression of LDLR. Thirteen potential target proteins for the action of PCSK9 inhibitors on DACD rats were identified. PRM and IHC revealed that PCSK9 inhibitors effectively counteracted the downregulation of transthyretin in DACD rats. CONCLUSION: This study uncovered the target proteins and specific mechanisms of PCSK9 inhibitors in DACD, providing an experimental basis for the clinical application of PCSK9 inhibitors for the potential treatment of DACD.","Yang, YangWang, YeyingWang, YuwenKe, TingyuZhao, Ling","Yang YWang YWang YKe TZhao L","Department of Endocrinology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, China.Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, China.Department of Endocrinology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, China.Department of Endocrinology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, China.Department of Endocrinology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240814","United States","PeerJ","PeerJ","101603425","0 (PCSK9 Inhibitors)EC 3.4.21.

Oxidative stress and chronic inflammatory cascades prevalent in individuals with senile diabetes significantly amplify disease progression and complication rates. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) emerges as a pivotal player in enhancing blood sugar homeostasis and retarding complication onset in the clinical management of senile diabetes. Nonetheless, an evident research gap persists regarding the integration of TCM's renal tonification pharmacological mechanisms with experimental validation within the realm of senile diabetes therapeutics. AIMS: The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of action of New Shenqi Pills (SQP) in the treatment of SDM and make an experimental assessment. METHODS: Network analysis is used to evaluate target pathways related to SQP and SDM. Mitochondrial-related genes were obtained from the MitoCarta3.0 database and intersected with the common target genes of the disease and drugs, then constructing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network making use of the GeneMANIA database. Representative compounds in the SQP were quantitatively measured using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to ensure quality control and quantitative analysis of the compounds. A type 2 diabetes mice (C57BL/6) model was used to investigate the pharmacodynamics of SQP. The glucose lowering efficacy of SQP was assessed through various metrics including body weight and fasting blood glucose (FBG). To elucidate the modulatory effects of SQP on pancreatic beta cell function, we measured oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin histochemical staining and tunel apoptosis detection, then assessed the insulin-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase A (Akt)/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) pathway in diabetic mice via Western blotting. Additionally, we observe the structural changes of the nucleus, cytoplasmic granules and mitochondria of pancreatic islet β cells. RESULTS: In this investigation, we identified a total of 1876 genes associated with senile diabetes, 278 targets of SQP, and 166 overlapping target genes, primarily enriched in pathways pertinent to oxidative stress response, peptide response, and oxygen level modulation. Moreover, an intersection analysis involving 1,136 human mitochondrial genes and comorbidity targets yielded 15 mitochondria-related therapeutic targets. Quality control assessments and quantitative analyses of SQP revealed the predominant presence of five compounds with elevated concentrations: Catalpol, Cinnamon Aldehyde, Rehmanthin D, Trigonelline, and Paeonol Phenol. Vivo experiments demonstrated notable findings. Relative to the control group, mice in the model group exhibited significant increases in body weight and fasting blood glucose levels, alongside decreased insulin secretion and heightened islet cell apoptosis. Moreover, β-cells nuclear condensation and mitochondrial cristae disappearance were observed, accompanied by reduced expression levels of p-GSK-3β protein in islet cells (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Conversely, treatment groups administered SQP and Rg displayed augmented expressions of the aforementioned protein markers (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), alongside preserved mitochondrial cristae structure in islet β cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that SQP can ameliorate diabetes by reducing islet cell apoptosis and resist oxidative stress. These insulin-mediated PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway plays an important regulatory role in this process.","Zhang, YueYingZhou, YangWen, ZhiGeWang, HaoShuoZhang, ShanNi, Qing","Zhang YZhou YWen ZWang HZhang SNi Q","Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinses Medicine Sciences, Beijing, China.Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinses Medicine Sciences, Beijing, China.Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinses Medicine Sciences, Beijing, China.Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinses Medicine Sciences, Beijing, China.Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinses Medicine Sciences, Beijing, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240612","Switzerland","Front Pharmacol","Frontiers in pharmacology","101548923",NA,NA,NA,"PMC11211868",NA,"NOTNLM","New Shenqi Pillsmitochondrial cristae structurenetwork analysisoxidative stresssenile diabetesvivo experiments","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","2024/07/01 06:42","2024/07/01 06:43","2024/06/12","2024/07/01 05:56","2023/11/16 00:00 [received]2024/05/16 00:00 [accepted]2024/07/01 06:43 [medline]2024/07/01 06:42 [pubmed]2024/07/01 05:56 [entrez]2024/06/12 00:00 [pmc-release]","1339758 [pii]10.3389/fphar.2024.1339758 [doi]","epublish","Front Pharmacol. 2024 Jun 12;15:1339758. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2024.1339758. eCollection 2024.","Copyright © 2024 Zhang, Zhou, Wen, Wang, Zhang and Ni.",NA,NA,"10.3389/fphar.2024.1339758",NA,2024

METHODS: Firstly, we collected urine samples from type 2 diabetic patients and normal controls. These type 2 diabetic patients were divided into two groups according to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c% (HbA1c), respectively. Magnetic beads based weak cation exchange chromatography (MB-WCX) was used to condense urinary peptides. The eluates were then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Subsequently, ClinProt was used to profile and screen the polypeptide patterns based on different methods of grouping in diabetic patients and normal controls. Finally, the amino acid sequences of differentially expressed peptides were identified by nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and the protein sources of the corresponding peptide were matched in IPI Human database. RESULTS: Proteomics analysis found two up-regulated peptide (m/z 2756.1 and m/z 3223.2) representations in diabetic subjects, and the two peptides increased with increases in the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin. Further, the parallelism between m/z 3223.2 and glycosylated hemoglobin was better than the parallelism between m/z 2756.1 and glycosylated hemoglobin. Area under the receiver operating characteristic of the two peptides was 0.722 and 0.661, respectively. The above-mentioned peptide m/z 2756.1 was further identified as fragment of fibrinogen alpha chain precursor and m/z 3223.2 was fragment of prothrombin precursor.

Epimedin C is considered one of the most important flavonoids in Epimedium, a famous edible herb in China and Southeast Asia that is traditionally used in herbal medicine to treat diabetes. In the present study, the therapeutic potential of epimedin C against T2DM was ascertained using a mouse model, and the mechanism underlying the hypoglycemic activity of epimedin C was explored using a label-free proteomic technique for the first time. Levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and oral glucose tolerance, as well as contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the 30 mg·kg(-1) epimedin C group (EC30 group), were significantly lower than those in the model control group (MC group) (p < 0.05), while the contents of hepatic glycogen, insulin, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), as well as activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the EC30 group were notably higher than those in the MC group (p < 0.05). The structures of liver cells and tissues were greatly destroyed in the MC group, whereas the structures of cells and tissues were basically complete in the EC30 group, which were similar to those in the normal control group (NC group). A total of 92 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were enriched in the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. In the EC30 vs. MC groups, the expression level of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) was down-regulated, while the expression levels of group XIIB secretory phospholipase A2-like protein (Pla2g12b), apolipoprotein B-100 (Apob), and cytochrome P450 4A14 (Cyp4a14) were up-regulated. According to the KEGG pathway assay, Pck1 participated in the gluconeogenesis and insulin signaling pathways, and Pla2g12b, Apob, and Cyp4a14 were the key proteins in the fat digestion and fatty acid degradation pathways. Pck1, Pla2g12b, Apob, and Cyp4a14 seemed to play important roles in the prevention and treatment of T2DM. In summary, epimedin C inhibited Pck1 expression to maintain FBG at a relatively stable level, promoted Pla2g12b, Apob, and Cyp4a14 expressions to alleviate liver lipotoxicity, and protected liver tissues and cells from oxidant stress possibly by its phenolic hydroxyl groups.","Zhou, XuexueLiu, ZiqiYang, XiaohuaFeng, JingGins, Murat SabirovichYan, TingyuHan, LeiZhang, Huafeng","Zhou XLiu ZYang

The study aimed to explore the mechanism of mulberry leaf in the treatment of T2DM through tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteomics analysis of skeletal muscle. METHODS: The anti-diabetic activity of mulberry leaf extract (MLE) was evaluated by using streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats at a dose of 4.0 g crude drug /kg p.o. daily for 8 weeks. Fasting blood glucose, body weight, food and water intake were monitored at specific intervals, and oral glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test were conducted at the 7th and 8th week respectively. At the end of the experiment, levels of glycated hemoglobin A1c, insulin, free fat acid, leptin, adiponectin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were assessed and the pathological changes of rat skeletal muscle were observed by HE staining. TMT-based quantitative proteomic analysis of skeletal muscle and bioinformatics analysis were performed and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were validated by western blot. The interactions between the components of MLE and DEPs were further assessed using molecular docking. RESULTS: After 8 weeks of MLE intervention, the clinical indications of T2DM such as body weight, food and water intake of rats were improved to a certain extent, while insulin sensitivity was increased and glycemic control was improved. Serum lipid profiles were significantly reduced, and the skeletal muscle fiber gap and atrophy were alleviated. Proteomic analysis of skeletal muscle showed that MLE treatment reversed 19 DEPs in T2DM rats, regulated cholesterol metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, vitamin digestion and absorption and ferroptosis signaling pathways. Key differential proteins Apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA1) and ApoA4 were successfully validated by western blot and exhibited strong binding activity to the MLE's ingredients. CONCLUSIONS: This study first provided skeletal muscle proteomic changes in T2DM rats before and after MLE treatment, which may help us understand the molecular mechanisms, and provide a foundation for developing potential therapeutic targets of anti-T2DM of MLE.","Shi, LuWang, JingkangHe, ChanghaoHuang, YanFu, WanxinZhang, HuilinAn, YongchengWang, MengluShan, ZiyiLi, HuiminLv, YinglanWang, ChenCheng, LongDai, HongyuDuan, YuhuiZhao, HongbinZhao, Baosheng","Shi LWang JHe CHuang YFu WZhang HAn YWang MShan ZLi HLv YWang CCheng LDai HDuan YZhao HZhao B","Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.Qingdao Municipal Hospital, University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Qingdao, China.Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.College of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.College of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.College of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.College of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.Department of Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 102488, China.Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China.Beijing Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029, China. zhaobs1973@163.com.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20230904","England","BMC Complement Med Ther","BMC complementary medicine and therapies","101761232","0 (Insulin)0 (Cholesterol, HDL)0 (Plant Extracts)Morus alba","IM","AnimalsRats*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy*Morus*Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/drug therapyMolecular Docking SimulationProteomicsInsulinBody WeightCholesterol, HDLPlant Extracts/pharmacology","PMC10476348",NA,"NOTNLM","Lipid metabolismMulberry leafProteomicsType 2 diabetes mellitus","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","2023/09/05 00:42","2023/09/06 06:42","2023/09/04","2023/09/04 23:51","2022/12/29 00:00 [received]2023/08/25 00:00 [accepted]2023/09/06 06:42 [medline]2023/09/05 00:42 [pubmed]2023/09/04 23:51 [entrez]2023/09/04 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1186/s12906-023-04140-3 [pii]4140 [pii]10.1186/s12906-023-04140-3 [doi]","epublish","BMC Complement Med Ther. 2023 Sep 4;23(1):308. doi: 10.1186/s12906-023-04140-3.","© 2023.

Among the possible causes, the excess of red meat and the insufficiency of vegetables consumption are suspected. Such an alimentation is associated with nutritional biomarkers, including trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and its precursors. Here, we aimed to study these biomarkers as potential prognostic factors for HF in patients with T2D. METHODS: We used the SURDIAGENE (SURvival DIAbetes and GENEtics) study, a large, prospective, monocentric cohort study including 1468 patients with T2D between 2001 and 2012. TMAO and its precursors (trimethylamine [TMA], betaine, choline, and carnitine) as well as thio-amino-acids (cysteine, homocysteine and methionine) were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The main outcome was HF requiring Hospitalization (HFrH) defined as the first occurrence of acute HF leading to hospitalization and/or death, established by an adjudication committee, based on hospital records until 31st December 2015. The secondary outcomes were the composite event HFrH and/or cardiovascular death and all-cause death. The association between the biomarkers and the outcomes was studied using cause-specific hazard-models, adjusted for age, sex, history of coronary artery disease, NT-proBNP, CKD-EPI-derived eGFR and the urine albumin/creatinine ratio. Hazard-ratios (HR) are expressed for one standard deviation. RESULTS: The data of interest were available for 1349/1468 of SURDIAGENE participants (91.9%), including 569 (42.2%) women, with a mean age of 64.3 ± 10.7 years and a median follow-up of 7.3 years [25th-75th percentile, 4.7-10.8]. HFrH was reported in 209 patients (15.5%), HFrH and/or cardiovascular death in 341 (25.3%) and all-cause death in 447 (33.1%). In unadjusted hazard-models, carnitine (HR = 1.20, 95% CI [1.05; 1.37]), betaine (HR = 1.34, [1.20; 1.50]), choline (HR = 1.35, [1.20; 1.52]), TMAO (HR = 1.32, [1.16; 1.50]), cysteine (HR = 1.38, [1.21; 1.58]) and homocysteine (HR = 1.28, [1.17; 1.39]) were associated with HFrH, but not TMA and methionine. In the fully adjusted models, none of these associations was significant, neither for HFrH nor for HFrH and/or CV death, when homocysteine only was positively associated with all-cause death (HR = 1.16, [1.06; 1.27]). CONCLUSIONS: TMAO and its precursors do not appear to be substantial prognosis factors for HFrH, beyond usual cardiac and kidney-related risk factors, whereas homocysteine is an independent risk factor for all-cause death in patients with T2D.","Wargny, MatthieuCroyal, MikaëlRagot, StéphanieGand, EliseJacobi, DavidTrochu, Jean-NoëlPrieur, XavierLe May, CédricGoronflot, ThomasCariou, BertrandSaulnier, Pierre-JeanHadjadj, Samy","Wargny MCroyal MRagot SGand EJacobi DTrochu JNPrieur XLe May CGoronflot TCariou BSaulnier PJHadjadj S","Nantes Université, CHU Nantes, CNRS, INSERM, l'institut du thorax, 44000, Nantes, France.CHU de Nantes, INSERM CIC 1413, Pôle Hospitalo-Universitaire 11: Santé Publique, Clinique des données, Nantes, France.Nantes Université, CHU Nantes, CNRS, INSERM, l'institut du thorax, 44000, Nantes, France.Université de Nantes, CHU Nantes, Inserm, CNRS, SFR Santé, Inserm UMS 016, CNRS UMS 3556, 44000, Nantes, France.CRNH-Ouest Mass Spectrometry Core Facility, 44000, Nantes, France.Université de Poitiers, INSERM CHU de Poitiers, Centre d'Investigation Clinique, CIC 1402, Poitiers, France.Université de Poitiers, INSERM CHU de Poitiers, Centre d'Investigation Clinique, CIC 1402, Poitiers, France.Nantes Université, CHU Nantes, CNRS, INSERM, l'institut du thorax, 44000, Nantes, France.CRNH-Ouest Mass Spectrometry Core Facility, 44000, Nantes, France.Nantes Université, CHU Nantes, CNRS, INSERM, l'institut du thorax, 44000, Nantes, France.Nantes Université, CNRS, INSERM, l'institut du thorax, 44000, Nantes, France.Nantes Université, CNRS, INSERM, l'institut du thorax, 44000, Nantes, France.CHU de Nantes, INSERM CIC 1413, Pôle Hospitalo-Universitaire 11: Santé Publique, Clinique des données, Nantes, France.Nantes Université, CHU Nantes, CNRS, INSERM, l'institut du thorax, 44000, Nantes, France.Université de Poitiers, INSERM CHU de Poitiers, Centre d'Investigation Clinique, CIC 1402, Poitiers, France.Nantes Université, CHU Nantes, CNRS, INSERM, l'institut du thorax, 44000, Nantes, France. samy.hadjadj@univ-nantes.fr.Université de Nantes, CHU Nantes, Inserm, CNRS, SFR Santé, Inserm UMS 016, CNRS UMS 3556, 44000, Nantes, France. samy.hadjadj@univ-nantes.fr.CRNH-Ouest Mass Spectrometry Core Facility, 44000, Nantes, France. samy.hadjadj@univ-nantes.fr.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20220609","England","Cardiovasc Diabetol","Cardiovascular diabetology","101147637","0 (Biomarkers)0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)3SCV180C9W (Betaine)AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)N91BDP6H0X (Choline)S7UI8SM58A (Carnitine)","IM","AgedBetaineBiomarkersCarnitineCholineCohort StudiesCysteine*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/diagnosisFemale*Heart Failure/diagnosisHomocysteineHospitalizationHumansMaleMethionineMiddle AgedProspective StudiesRisk Factors","PMC9185908",NA,"NOTNLM","Cohort studyDiabetes mellitusHeart failureHomocysteineNutritional biomarkersTMAO","The authors declare no conflict of interest related to this work.FIR  Marechaud, RichardIR   Marechaud RFIR  Javaugue, VincentIR   Javaugue VFIR  Hulin-Delmotte, CharlotteIR   Hulin-Delmotte CFIR  Llatty, PierreIR   Llatty PFIR  Ducrocq, GregoryIR   Ducrocq GFIR  Roussel, RonanIR   Roussel RFIR  Rigalleau, VincentIR   Rigalleau VFIR  Pucheu, YannIR   Pucheu YFIR  Montaigne, DavidIR   Montaigne DFIR  Halimi, Jean-MichelIR   Halimi JMFIR  Gatault, PhilippeIR   Gatault PFIR  Sosner, PhilippeIR   Sosner PFIR  Gellen, BarnabasIR   Gellen B","2022/06/11 06:00","2022/06/14 06:00","2022/06/09","2022/06/10 00:38","2022/02/19 00:00 [received]2022/04/05 00:00 [accepted]2022/06/10 00:38 [entrez]2022/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]2022/06/14 06:00 [medline]2022/06/09 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1186/s12933-022-01505-9 [pii]1505 [pii]10.1186/s12933-022-01505-9 [doi]","epublish","Cardiovasc Diabetol. 2022 Jun 9;21(1):101. doi: 10.1186/s12933-022-01505-9.","© 2022.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease leading to irreversible loss of neurons, intellectual abilities, memory and reasoning. The worldwide prevalence of diabetes and AD in elderly population is a major public health concern. Interestingly, both health issues are unraveling the puzzling links. The clinico-pathological relationship between diabetes and AD has been reported at genomic and proteomic levels. The association of virus infection in type 2 diabetes mellitus and AD has been reported in few recent studies, some have shown direct evidence of virus infection in diabetes and AD while other have shown that diabetes increases the risk of developing AD. This review aims to summarize the association of few common viruses like Hepatitis C Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus-1 which affects both these two age-related devastating diseases. We also discuss the pathological links of Influenza virus, Cytomegalovirus, West Nile virus, Enterovirus, Herpes Simplex Virus-2, Hepatitis viruses in diabetes and Influenza virus, Picornavirus and Borna disease virus in AD. Establishing such relationships and defining their common pathogenesis and patho-physiological mechanisms may lead to new concepts and paths for developing novel preventive strategies and pharmacological treatment options for diabetes and AD. This study may aid in future for the identification of a single or a panel of likely blood-based viral biomarkers for early diagnosis of diabetes and AD with high sensitivity and specificity.","Karim, SajjadMirza, ZeenatKamal, Mohammad AAbuzenadah, Adel MAzhar, Esam IAl-Qahtani, Mohammed HSohrab, Sayed S","Karim SMirza ZKamal MAAbuzenadah AMAzhar EIAl-Qahtani MHSohrab SS","Special Infectious Agents Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Post Box No 80216, Jeddah -21589, Saudi Arabia. sohrab_sartaj2@rediffmail.com.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"United Arab Emirates","CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets","CNS & neurological disorders drug targets","101269155",NA,"IM","*Alzheimer Disease/complications/epidemiology/virologyAnimals*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/epidemiology/virologyHumansVirus Diseases/classification/*complications/*epidemiology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013/09/26 06:00","2015/01/08 06:00",NA,"2013/09/25 06:00","2013/03/24 00:00 [received]2013/04/06 00:00 [revised]2013/04/08 00:00 [accepted]2013/09/25 06:00 [entrez]2013/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]2015/01/08 06:00 [medline]","CNSNDDT-EPUB-56187 [pii]10.2174/18715273113126660164 [doi]","ppublish","CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets. 2014 Apr;13(3):429-39. doi: 10.2174/18715273113126660164.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2014

Vitamin D (VD) has antidiabetic effects. However, the protective mechanism of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) on T2DM is still unclear. METHODS: A rat model of T2DM was constructed using a high-fat diet combined with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Glucose tolerance was assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Insulin secretion in blood and cell supernatant was determined by ELISA. Cell viability was analysed by CCK-8 assay. The level of ROS was detected by the DCFH-DA fluorescent probe method. The iron level in pancreatic tissues and cells was detected by an iron assay kit. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression of the pancreatic β cell marker CD49a. Furthermore, the protein expression levels of ferroptosis pathway-related proteins and vitamin D receptor (VDR) were detected by western blot. Downstream VDR targets were screened by proteomic sequencing. RESULTS: The DM group had increased glucose levels and decreased insulin secretion, while 1,25D treatment decreased glucose levels and increased insulin secretion. 1,25D also suppressed DM-induced ferroptosis in pancreatic tissues in vivo. In addition, 1,25D significantly enhanced the viability of pancreatic β cells and reduced the levels of ROS and iron. 1,25D significantly upregulated the expression of VDR and the ferroptosis-related pathway protein GPX4 and downregulated the expression of ACSL4. Furthermore, knockdown of VDR reversed the effects of 1,25D on cell viability, ROS and iron levels, and ferroptosis-related protein expression in pancreatic β cells. Proteomic sequencing revealed that FOXO1 was the downstream target gene of VDR. Knockdown of FOXO1 reduced pancreatic β cell death, decreased ROS, iron and ACSL4 levels, and increased GPX4 levels. CONCLUSION: 1,25D/VDR inhibited pancreatic β cell ferroptosis in T2DM by downregulating the expression of FOXO1. This study provides a new theoretical basis for basic research on T2DM and is expected to establish a new idea for the treatment of T2DM.","Ding, YaoWu, Qinan","Ding YWu Q","Endocrinology and Nephrology Department, Chongqing University Cancer Hospital and Chongqing Cancer Institute and Chongqing Cancer Hospital, Chongqing, China.Endocrinology and Nephrology Department, Chongqing University Cancer Hospital and Chongqing Cancer Institute and Chongqing Cancer Hospital, Chongqing, China.

The study of characteristic metabolic alterations of DKD is crucial for a better understanding of pathogenesis to identify new potential biomarkers and drug targets. We hypothesized that metabolic profiling of amino acids, acylcarnitines, and organic acids are useful new biomarkers for the diagnosis of the early stages of DKDMethods: The hypothesis was testing in a case-control study of 232 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 150 healthy controls. Patients were classified according to urinary albumin and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) into 100 with normoalbuminuria and 132 with microalbuminuria group. Eighteen AcylCNs and 17 amino acids were measured in the blood by tandem mass spectrometry while 17 urinary organic acids were quantitatively measured by gas chromatography  mass spectrometry.Results: Regression analysis found that dodecanoylcarnitines C12 (effect size 2.03 [95%CI 1.73-2.32]), triglylcarnitine C5:1 (2.01 [1.70-2.30]), and isovalerylcarnitine C5 (1.78 [1.48-2.07]) were stronger predictors of albumin/creatinine ratio than HbA1c (1.50 [1.20-1.78]) and hence they could serve as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of the early stages of DKD.Conclusions: Targeted metabolic profiling offers a new, non-invasive approach for detecting biomarkers for the early diagnosis of DKD suggesting new pathogenetic phases that might be new targets for treatment.","Abdelsattar, SKasemy, Z AElsayed, MElrahem, T AZewain, S K","Abdelsattar SAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-3993-5378Kasemy ZAAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-3187-3088Elsayed MElrahem TAZewain SKAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6029-857X","Clinical Biochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics Department, National Liver Institute, Menoufia University, Shibin El Kom, Egypt.Menoufia Faculty of Medicine, Public Health and Community Medicine, Shibin El Kom, Egypt.Internal Medicine Department, Menoufia Faculty of Medicine, Shibin El Kom, Egypt.Resident of Internal Medicine, EL Menia General Hospital, EL Menia, Egypt.Internal Medicine Department, Menoufia Faculty of Medicine, Shibin El Kom, Egypt.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20210510","Switzerland","Br J Biomed Sci","British journal of biomedical science","9309208","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Albuminuria/diagnosisBiomarkersCase-Control Studies*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/diagnosis*Diabetic Nephropathies/diagnosisGlomerular Filtration RateHumansMetabolomics",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","Acylcarnitinesalbuminuriadiabetes mellitus type 2diabetic kidney diseasemetabolomicsurinary organic acids",NA,"2021/03/04 06:00","2022/01/15 06:00",NA,"2021/03/03 17:09","2021/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]2022/01/15 06:00 [medline]2021/03/03 17:09 [entrez]","10.1080/09674845.2021.1894705 [doi]","ppublish","Br J Biomed Sci. 2021 Oct;78(4):184-190. doi: 10.1080/09674845.2021.1894705.

Identification of novel biomarkers are needed to distinguish metabolic syndrome from equally obese individuals in order to direct them to early interventions that reduce their risk of developing further health problems. We utilized mass spectrometry-based targeted metabolic profiling of 221 metabolites to evaluate the associations between metabolite profiles and established metabolic syndrome criteria (i.e. elevated waist circumference, hypertension, elevated fasting glucose, elevated triglycerides, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) in plasma samples from obese men ( n = 29; BMI = 35.5 ± 5.2 kg/m(2)) and women ( n = 40; 34.9 ± 6.7 kg/m(2)), of which 26 met the criteria for metabolic syndrome (17 men and 9 women). Compared to obese individuals without metabolic syndrome, univariate statistical analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis showed that a specific group of metabolites from multiple metabolic pathways (i.e. purine metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, and tryptophan metabolism) were associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome. Receiver operating characteristic curves generated based on the PLS-DA models showed excellent areas under the curve (0.85 and 0.96, for metabolites only model and enhanced metabolites model, respectively), high specificities (0.86 and 0.93), and good sensitivities (0.71 and 0.91). Moreover, principal component analysis revealed that metabolic profiles can be used to further differentiate metabolic syndrome with 3 versus 4-5 metabolic syndrome criteria. Collectively, these findings support targeted metabolomics approaches to distinguish metabolic syndrome from obesity alone, and to stratify metabolic syndrome status based on the number of criteria met. Impact statement We utilized mass spectrometry-based targeted metabolic profiling of 221 metabolites to evaluate the associations between metabolite profiles and established MetS criteria. To our best knowledge, the findings of this study provide the first evidence that metabolic profiles can be used to differentiate participants with MetS from similarly obese individuals who do not meet established criteria of MetS. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that within MetS participants, their unique metabolic profiles correlated to the number of criteria used for MetS determination. Taken together, this metabolic profiling approach can potentially serve as a novel tool for MetS detection and monitoring, and provide useful metabolic information for future interventions targeting obesity and MetS.","Zhong, FanyiXu, MengyangBruno, Richard SBallard, Kevin DZhu, Jiangjiang","Zhong FXu MBruno RSBallard KDZhu J","1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Miami University, Oxford, OH 45056, USA.1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Miami University, Oxford, OH 45056, USA.2 Human Nutrition Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.3 Department of Kinesiology and Health, Miami University, Oxford, OH 45056, USA.1 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Miami University, Oxford, OH 45056, USA.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20170101","Switzerland","Exp Biol Med (Maywood)","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)","100973463","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)0 (Triglycerides)","IM","AdultBiomarkers/bloodBlood Glucose/analysisChromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methodsFemaleHumansHypertension/bloodLipoproteins, HDL/bloodMaleMetabolic Syndrome/*blood/diagnosisMetabolomics/methodsObesity/*blood/diagnosisROC CurveSensitivity and SpecificityTandem Mass Spectrometry/methodsTriglycerides/bloodWaist Circumference","PMC5363695",NA,"NOTNLM","HPLC-MS/MSmetabolic pathwaysmetabolic syndromeobesitytargeted metabolic profiling",NA,"2017/03/17 06:00","2017/06/27 06:00","2017/10/01","2017/03/17 06:00","2017/03/17 06:00 [entrez]2017/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]2017/06/27 06:00 [medline]2017/10/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1177_1535370217694098 [pii]10.1177/1535370217694098 [doi]","ppublish","Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2017 Apr;242(7):773-780. doi: 10.1177/1535370217694098.

Therefore, we aimed to determine whether acylcarnitines could independently predict type 2 diabetes by using a targeted metabolic profiling approach. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A population-based prospective study was conducted among 2,103 community-living Chinese individuals aged 50-70 years from Beijing and Shanghai with a mean follow-up duration of 6 years. Fasting glucose, glycohemoglobin, and insulin were determined at baseline and in a follow-up survey. Baseline plasma acylcarnitines were profiled by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Over the 6-year period, 507 participants developed diabetes. A panel of acylcanitines, especially with long chain, was significantly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The relative risks of type 2 diabetes per SD increase of the predictive model score were 2.48 (95% CI 2.20-2.78) for the conventional and 9.41 (95% CI 7.62-11.62) for the full model including acylcarnitines, respectively. Moreover, adding selected acylcarnitines substantially improved predictive ability for incident diabetes, as area under the receiver operator characteristic curve improved to 0.89 in the full model compared with 0.73 in the conventional model. Similar associations were obtained when the predictive models were established separately among Beijing or Shanghai residents. CONCLUSIONS: A panel of acylcarnitines, mainly involving mitochondrial lipid dysregulation, significantly improved predictive ability for type 2 diabetes beyond conventional risk factors. These findings need to be replicated in other populations, and the underlying mechanisms should be elucidated.","Sun, LiangLiang, LimingGao, XianfuZhang, HuipingYao, PangHu, YaoMa, YiweiWang, FeijieJin, QianluLi, HuaixingLi, RongxiaLiu, YongHu, Frank BZeng, RongLin, XuWu, Jiarui","Sun LLiang LGao XZhang HYao PHu YMa YWang FJin QLi HLi RLiu YHu FBZeng RLin XWu J","Key Laboratory of Nutrition and Metabolism, Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

Recently many new biomarkers have been evaluated in diabetic patients, and apart from urinary proteomics, none has yet outperformed Harry Keen's discovery of microalbuminuria as the best screening tool for diabetic nephropathy. Remission of microalbuminuria preserves renal function. Microalbuminuria has also stood the test of time as a valid powerful independent predictor for fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular outcome in diabetes.

In this study, we used our own established LC-MS/MS method to examine the plasma BH4 levels in diabetes to determine whether it could be used as a biomarker for the prediction of kidney injury in those patients. METHODS: Hospitalized diabetes patients in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan to Aug 2021 were recruited. To assess the association between plasma BH4 with ACR or eGFR in diabetes, a total of 142 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) were enrolled. They were divided into three groups by albuminuria levels: normoalbuminuria (n = 68), microalbuminuria (n = 48), and macroalbuminuria (n = 26) according to ACR; or into two groups by eGFR: eGFR≥90 or eGFR<90 ml/min for correlation and logistic regression analysis. Plasma BH4 level was measured by LC-MS/MS along with other biochemical indices. RESULTS: Plasma BH4 concentrations were decreased as ACR progressed. BH4 (r = -0.55, P < 0.001) and 2h C-Peptide (CP-2h) (r = -0.248, P = 0.003) levels were negatively correlated with ACR. Moreover, multivariable logistic regression analysis showed BH4 concentrations (B = -0.468, P < 0.001) and CP-2h (B = -0.257, P = 0.028) were independently associated with ACR progression. ROC curve showed that BH4 level has a predictive value on ACR (95%CI 0.686-0.841, sensitivity 69.1%, specificity 73%). Moreover, in diabetes patients with eGFR≥90 ml/min, plasma BH4 level (P = 0.008) is higher than those in diabetes with eGFR<90 ml/min and BH4 was remained independently associated with eGFR after multivariable logistic regression analysis (B = -0.193, P = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Our established LC-MS/MS method could be used on human plasma BH4 measurements and our data suggested that BH4 level can be used as a biomarker for kidney injury in diabetes indicated by its association with ACR progression and early renal function decline.","Deng, ChunxiaWang, ShuoNiu, ZhiliYe, YahongGao, Ling","Deng CWang SNiu ZYe YGao L","Department of Endocrinology & Metabolism, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China.Department of Endocrinology & Metabolism, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China.Department of Clinic Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China.Department of Endocrinology & Metabolism, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China.Department of Endocrinology & Metabolism, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, China.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between circulating metabolites and persistent tinnitus. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a population-based case-control study of 6477 women who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHS II with metabolomic profiles and tinnitus data. Information on tinnitus onset and frequency was collected on biennial questionnaires (2009-2017). For cases, metabolomic profiles were measured (2015-2021) in blood samples collected after the date of the participant's first report of persistent tinnitus (NHS, 1989-1999 and 2010-2012; NHS II, 1996-1999). Data analyses were performed from January 24, 2022, to January 14, 2023. EXPOSURES: In total, 466 plasma metabolites from 488 cases of persistent tinnitus and 5989 controls were profiled using 3 complementary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry approaches. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of persistent tinnitus (per 1 SD increase in metabolite values) and 95% CIs for each individual metabolite. Metabolite set enrichment analysis was used to identify metabolite classes enriched for associations with tinnitus. RESULTS: Of the 6477 study participants (mean [SD] age, 52 [9] years; 6477 [100%] female; 6121 [95%] White individuals) who were registered nurses, 488 reported experiencing daily persistent (≥5 minutes) tinnitus. Compared with participants with no tinnitus (5989 controls), those with persistent tinnitus were slightly older (53.0 vs 51.8 years) and more likely to be postmenopausal, using oral postmenopausal hormone therapy, and have type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and/or hearing loss at baseline. Compared with controls, homocitrulline (OR, 1.32; (95% CI, 1.16-1.50); C38:6 phosphatidylethanolamine (PE; OR, 1.24; 95% CIs, 1.12-1.38), C52:6 triglyceride (TAG; OR, 1.22; 95% CIs, 1.10-1.36), C36:4 PE (OR, 1.22; 95% CIs, 1.10-1.35), C40:6 PE (OR, 1.22; 95% CIs, 1.09-1.35), and C56:7 TAG (OR, 1.21; 95% CIs, 1.09-1.34) were positively associated, whereas α-keto-β-methylvalerate (OR, 0.68; 95% CIs, 0.56-0.82) and levulinate (OR, 0.60; 95% CIs, 0.46-0.79) were inversely associated with persistent tinnitus. Among metabolite classes, TAGs (normalized enrichment score [NES], 2.68), PEs (NES, 2.48), and diglycerides (NES, 1.65) were positively associated, whereas phosphatidylcholine plasmalogens (NES, -1.91), lysophosphatidylcholines (NES, -2.23), and cholesteryl esters (NES,-2.31) were inversely associated with persistent tinnitus. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This population-based case-control study of metabolomic profiles and tinnitus identified novel plasma metabolites and metabolite classes that were significantly associated with persistent tinnitus, suggesting that metabolomic studies may help improve understanding of tinnitus pathophysiology and identify therapeutic targets for this challenging disorder.","Zeleznik, Oana AWelling, D BradleyStankovic, KonstantinaFrueh, LisaBalasubramanian, RajiCurhan, Gary CCurhan, Sharon G","Zeleznik OAWelling DBStankovic KFrueh LBalasubramanian RCurhan GCCurhan SG","Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston.Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California.Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst.Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.

The current study was designed to screen the feature metabolites classified as potential biomarkers, and to provide deeper insights into the underlying distinctive metabolic changes during disease progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma metabolite profiles were obtained by the ultra-high liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry method from healthy control participants, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and patients with DSPN. Potential biomarkers were selected through comprehensive analysis of statistically significant differences between groups. RESULTS: Overall, 938 metabolites were identified. Among them, 12 metabolites (dimethylarginine, N6-acetyllysine, N-acetylhistidine, N,N,N-trimethyl-alanylproline betaine, cysteine, 7-methylguanine, N6-carbamoylthreonyladenosine, pseudouridine, 5-methylthioadenosine, N2,N2-dimethylguanosine, aconitate and C-glycosyl tryptophan) were identified as the specific biomarkers. The content of 12 metabolites were significantly higher in the DSPN group compared with the other two groups. Additionally, they showed good performance to discriminate the DSPN state. Correlation analyses showed that the levels of 12 metabolites might be more closely related to the glucose metabolic changes, followed by the levels of lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of the 12 signature metabolites might provide a novel perspective for the pathogenesis of DSPN. Future studies are required to test this observation further.","Xu, JiahuiChen, QingguangCai, MengjieHan, XuLu, Hao","Xu JAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6224-169XChen QCai MHan XLu H","Department of Endocrinology, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.Department of Endocrinology, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.Department of Endocrinology, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.Department of Endocrinology, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.Department of Endocrinology, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.","eng","ZY(2021-2023)-0302/Construction of Special Disease Alliance of Traditional Chinese Medicine in East China Region and City Level-Construction of specialty alliance of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Yangtze River Delta/82074381/National Natural Science Foundation of China/82104786/National Natural Science Foundation of China/14DZ2273200/Shanghai Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Clinical Medicine/shslczdzk05401/Shanghai Municipal Key Clinical Specialty/","Journal Article","20230622","Japan","J Diabetes Investig","Journal of diabetes investigation","101520702","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Humans*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complicationsTandem Mass SpectrometryChromatography, High Pressure Liquid*Diabetic Neuropathies/complicationsMetabolomics/methodsBiomarkers*Polyneuropathies","PMC10445193",NA,"NOTNLM","Diabetic distal symmetric polyneuropathyMetabolomicsSignature metabolites","The authors declare no conflict of interest.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this functional adaptive behavior of the pancreatic β-cell. This study examines the dynamic changes in protein expression and phosphorylation state associated with (pro)insulin production and secretory pathway function mediated by euglycemia to induce β-cell rest in obese/diabetic db/db islet β-cells. Unbiased quantitative profiling of the protein expression and phosphorylation events that occur upon β-cell adaption during the transition from hyperglycemia to euglycemia was assessed in isolated pancreatic islets from obese diabetic db/db and wild-type (WT) mice using quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics together with bioinformatics analysis. Dynamic changes in the expression and phosphorylation of proteins associated with pancreatic β-cell (pro)insulin production and complementary regulated-secretory pathway regulation were observed in obese diabetic db/db islets in a hyperglycemic environment, relative to WT mouse islets in a normal euglycemic environment, that resolved when isolated db/db islets were exposed to euglycemia for 12 h in vitro. By similarly treating WT islets in parallel, the effects of tissue culture could be mostly eliminated and only those changes associated with resolution by euglycemia were assessed. Among such regulated protein phosphorylation-dependent signaling events were those associated with COPII-coated vesicle-dependent ER exit, ER-to-Golgi trafficking, clathrin-coat disassembly, and a particular association for the luminal Golgi protein kinase, FAM20C, in control of distal secretory pathway trafficking, sorting, and granule biogenesis. Protein expression and especially phosphorylation play key roles in the regulation of (pro)insulin production, correlative secretory pathway trafficking, and the restoration of β-cell secretory capacity in the adaptive functional β-cell response to metabolic demand, especially that mediated by glucose.","Kang, TaewookBoland, Brandon BAlarcon, CristinaGrimsby, Joseph SRhodes, Christopher JLarsen, Martin R","Kang TAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3959-4777Boland BBAlarcon CGrimsby JSRhodes CJLarsen MR","Protein Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , University of Southern Denmark , DK-5230 Odense M , Denmark.The Danish Diabetes Academy , 5000 Odense , Denmark.The Kovler Diabetes Center, Department of Medicine Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism , University of Chicago , Chicago , Illinois 60637 , United States.Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolic Disease Research , MedImmune LLC , Gaithersburg , Maryland 20878 , United States.The Kovler Diabetes Center, Department of Medicine Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism , University of Chicago , Chicago , Illinois 60637 , United States.Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolic Disease Research , MedImmune LLC , Gaithersburg , Maryland 20878 , United States.The Kovler Diabetes Center, Department of Medicine Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism , University of Chicago , Chicago , Illinois 60637 , United States.Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolic Disease Research , MedImmune LLC , Gaithersburg , Maryland 20878 , United States.Protein Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , University of Southern Denmark , DK-5230 Odense M , Denmark.","eng","R01 DK050610/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20190731","United States","J Proteome Res","Journal of proteome research","101128775","0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)0 (FAM20C protein, mouse)0 (Insulin)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IM","AnimalsBlood Glucose/drug effectsCOP-Coated Vesicles/geneticsCalcium-Binding Proteins/*geneticsDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*drug therapyDisease Models, AnimalExtracellular Matrix Proteins/*geneticsGlucose/metabolismGolgi Apparatus/drug effectsHumansHyperglycemia/drug therapy/geneticsInsulin/biosynthesis/geneticsInsulin-Secreting Cells/drug effectsMiceMice, Inbred NODObesity/drug therapy/geneticsPrediabetic State/blood/*drug therapyProtein Transport/drug effects*Proteomics",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","ER homeostasisER-to-Golgi traffickingd/deuglycemiainsulininsulin biosynthesismass spectrometryobesitypancreatic islet β-cellphosphoproteomicssecretory pathwaytranslationtype 2 diabetesβ-cell rest",NA,"2019/07/19 06:00","2020/08/12 06:00",NA,"2019/07/19 06:00","2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]2020/08/12 06:00 [medline]2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]","10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00160 [doi]","ppublish","J Proteome Res. 2019 Sep 6;18(9):3245-3258. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00160.

This paper aims to search for, analyze, and synthesize current updates regarding the development of these efforts. METHODS: We systematically searched the ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and PubMed databases for observational studies of protein biomarkers in patients with diabetes mellitus. We included studies published between January 2018 and April 2020, that were based on a population of patients with type-1 or type-2 diabetes mellitus aged ⩾18 years, with an observational design such as cross-sectional, case-control, or cohort studies. The dependent variable of the research results was in the form of protein biomarkers from urine, plasma, or serum. RESULTS: Following the screening process, 20 research articles with available full text met the inclusion criteria. These could be categorized as glomerular biomarkers (ANGPTL4, beta-2 microglobulin, Smad1, and glypican-5); inflammatory biomarkers (MCP-1 and adiponectin); and tubular biomarkers (NGAL, VDBP, megalin, sKlotho, and KIM-1). The development of a panel of biomarkers showed more promising results than those for a single biomarker in diagnosing diabetic kidney disease. CONCLUSION: All the biomarkers discussed in this review showed promising results for predicting diabetic kidney disease because they correlate with albuminuria, eGFR, or both. However, of the 11 protein biomarkers, none have prognostic value beyond albuminuria and eGFR.","Sauriasari, RaniSafitri, Dhonna DwiAzmi, Nuriza Ulul","Sauriasari RAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-7861-4369Safitri DDAzmi NU","Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Indonesia, Depok, 16424, Indonesia.Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Indonesia, Depok, 16424, Indonesia.Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Indonesia, Depok, 16424, Indonesia.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleReview","20211027","United States","Ther Adv Endocrinol Metab","Therapeutic advances in endocrinology and metabolism","101532143",NA,NA,NA,"PMC8554552",NA,"NOTNLM","albuminuriabiomarkerdiabetic kidney diseaseestimated glomerular filtration rateproteomic","Conflict of interest statement: The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.","2021/11/02 06:00","2021/11/02 06:01","2021/10/27","2021/11/01 09:17","2020/12/11 00:00 [received]2021/09/12 00:00 [accepted]2021/11/01 09:17 [entrez]2021/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]2021/11/02 06:01 [medline]2021/10/27 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1177_20420188211049612 [pii]10.1177/20420188211049612 [doi]","epublish","Ther Adv Endocrinol Metab. 2021 Oct 27;12:20420188211049612. doi: 10.1177/20420188211049612. eCollection 2021.","© The Author(s), 2021.",NA,NA,"10.1177/20420188211049612",NA,2021

Depleted and non‑depleted sera were prepared from the collected blood, and the global protein expression changes were evaluated by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Only significantly and markedly differentially‑expressed proteins (P<0.05, analysis of variance; maximum fold change ≥1.5) were considered as candidate proteins for informatics analysis. Accordingly, a total of 62 proteins were identified to be differentially expressed in T2DM, compared with control subjects, and they were grouped functionally into 16 classes of proteins. The largest class was that of the immune‑associated proteins. Additionally, ~25 of these proteins (40%) had previously been associated with DM; however, the association of the other 37 proteins with T2DM was a novel observation.

TB-T2D comorbidity worsens clinical control and prognosis of the affected individuals. The underlying metabolic alterations for this infectious-metabolic disease are still largely unknown. Possible mediators of the increased susceptibility to TB in diabetic patients are lipids levels, which are altered in individuals with T2D. To evaluate the modulation of glycerophospholipids in patients with TB-T2D, an untargeted lipidomic approach was developed by means of ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to electrospray ionization/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-QToF). In addition, tandem mass spectrometry was performed to determine the identity of the differentially expressed metabolites. We found that TB infected individuals with or without T2D share a common glycerophospholipid profile characterized by a decrease in phosphatidylcholines. A total of 14 glycerophospholipids were differentially deregulated in TB and TB-T2D patients and could potentially be considered biomarkers. It is necessary to further validate these identified lipids as biomarkers, focusing on the anticipate diagnosis for TB development in T2D predisposed individuals.","López-Hernández, YamileLara-Ramírez, Edgar ESalgado-Bustamante, MarianaLópez, Jesús AdriánOropeza-Valdez, Juan JJaime-Sánchez, ElenaCastañeda-Delgado, Julio EMagaña-Aquino, MartínMurgu, MichaelEnciso-Moreno, José A","López-Hernández YLara-Ramírez EESalgado-Bustamante MLópez JAOropeza-Valdez JJJaime-Sánchez ECastañeda-Delgado JEMagaña-Aquino MMurgu MEnciso-Moreno JA","Laboratorio de Metabolómica y Proteómica, CONACyT-Universidad Autónoma de Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico.Unidad de Investigación Biomédica de Zacatecas, Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social, Zacatecas, Mexico.Biochemistry Department, Medicine Faculty, Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí, Mexico.MicroRNAs Laboratory, Unidad Académica de Ciencias Biológicas, Universidad Autónoma de Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico.Unidad de Investigación Biomédica de Zacatecas, Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social, Zacatecas, Mexico.Unidad de Investigación Biomédica de Zacatecas, Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social, Zacatecas, Mexico.Cátedras-CONACyT, Unidad de Investigación Biomédica de Zacatecas, Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social, Zacatecas, Mexico.Hospital Central ""Dr. Ignacio Morones Prieto"", San Luis Potosí, Mexico.Waters Technologies of Brazil, Barueri, Brazil.Unidad de Investigación Biomédica de Zacatecas, Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social, Zacatecas, Mexico.

Although classical biomarkers such as age, HbA(1c) and diabetes duration are associated with glycaemic progression, it is unclear how well such variables predict insulin initiation or requirement and whether newly identified markers have added predictive value. METHODS: In two prospective cohort studies as part of IMI-RHAPSODY, we investigated whether clinical variables and three types of molecular markers (metabolites, lipids, proteins) can predict time to insulin requirement using different machine learning approaches (lasso, ridge, GRridge, random forest). Clinical variables included age, sex, HbA(1c), HDL-cholesterol and C-peptide. Models were run with unpenalised clinical variables (i.e. always included in the model without weights) or penalised clinical variables, or without clinical variables. Model development was performed in one cohort and the model was applied in a second cohort. Model performance was evaluated using Harrel's C statistic. RESULTS: Of the 585 individuals from the Hoorn Diabetes Care System (DCS) cohort, 69 required insulin during follow-up (1.0-11.4 years); of the 571 individuals in the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (GoDARTS) cohort, 175 required insulin during follow-up (0.3-11.8 years). Overall, the clinical variables and proteins were selected in the different models most often, followed by the metabolites. The most frequently selected clinical variables were HbA(1c) (18 of the 36 models, 50%), age (15 models, 41.2%) and C-peptide (15 models, 41.2%). Base models (age, sex, BMI, HbA(1c)) including only clinical variables performed moderately in both the DCS discovery cohort (C statistic 0.71 [95% CI 0.64, 0.79]) and the GoDARTS replication cohort (C 0.71 [95% CI 0.69, 0.75]). A more extensive model including HDL-cholesterol and C-peptide performed better in both cohorts (DCS, C 0.74 [95% CI 0.67, 0.81]; GoDARTS, C 0.73 [95% CI 0.69, 0.77]). Two proteins, lactadherin and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor, were most consistently selected and slightly improved model performance. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Using machine learning approaches, we show that insulin requirement risk can be modestly well predicted by predominantly clinical variables. Inclusion of molecular markers improves the prognostic performance beyond that of clinical variables by up to 5%. Such prognostic models could be useful for identifying people with diabetes at high risk of progressing quickly to treatment intensification.

The aim of this investigation was to assess, by a multimarker mass spectrometry approach, the predictive role of circulating proteins as biomarkers of cardiovascular damage progression associated with diabetes mellitus. METHODS: The study considered 34 patients with both T2DM and CHD, 31 patients with T2DM and without CHD, and 30 patients without diabetes with a diagnosis of CHD. Plasma samples of subjects were analysed through a multiplexed targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based assay, namely Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM), allowing the simultaneous detection of peptides derived from a protein of interest. Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis was employed to identify enriched GO terms in the biological process, molecular function, or cellular component categories. Non-parametric multivariate methods were used to classify samples from patients and evaluate the relevance of the analysed proteins' panel. RESULTS: A total of 81 proteins were successfully quantified in the human plasma samples. Gene Ontology analysis assessed terms related to blood microparticles, extracellular exosomes and collagen-containing extracellular matrix. Preliminary evaluation using analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the differences in the proteomic profile among patient groups identified 13 out of the 81 proteins as significantly different. Multivariate analysis, including cluster analysis and principal component analysis, identified relevant grouping of the 13 proteins. The first main cluster comprises apolipoprotein C-III, apolipoprotein C-II, apolipoprotein A-IV, retinol-binding protein 4, lysozyme C and cystatin-C; the second one includes, albeit with sub-grouping, alpha 2 macroglobulin, afamin, kininogen 1, vitronectin, vitamin K-dependent protein S, complement factor B and mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves obtained with the 13 selected proteins using a nominal logistic regression indicated a significant overall distinction (p < 0.001) among the three groups of subjects, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) ranging 0.91-0.97, and sensitivity and specificity ranging from 85 to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted mass spectrometry approach indicated 13 multiple circulating proteins as possible biomarkers of cardiovascular damage progression associated with T2DM, with excellent classification results in terms of sensitivity and specificity.","Piarulli, FrancescoBanfi, CristinaRagazzi, EugenioGianazza, EricaMunno, MarcoCarollo, MassimoTraldi, PietroLapolla, AnnunziataSartore, Giovanni","Piarulli FBanfi CRagazzi EGianazza EMunno MCarollo MTraldi PLapolla ASartore G","Department of Medicine  DIMED, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS, Milano, 20138, Italy. cristina.banfi@ccfm.it.Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy. eugenio.ragazzi@unipd.it.Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS, Milano, 20138, Italy.Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS, Milano, 20138, Italy.Department of Medicine  DIMED, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica Città della Speranza, Padova, Italy.Department of Medicine  DIMED, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.Department of Medicine  DIMED, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240120","England","Cardiovasc Diabetol","Cardiovascular diabetology","101147637","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Peptides)0 (Blood Proteins)","IM","Humans*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/diagnosisProteomics/methodsBiomarkersPeptidesBlood Proteins","PMC10800045",NA,"NOTNLM","Blood proteinsCardiovascular diseaseDiabetes mellitusGene Ontology analysisMass spectrometryMultiple reaction monitoringProteomics","The authors declare no competing interests.","2024/01/21 00:42","2024/01/22 06:42","2024/01/20","2024/01/20 23:28","2023/05/12 00:00 [received]2024/01/07 00:00 [accepted]2024/01/22 06:42 [medline]2024/01/21 00:42 [pubmed]2024/01/20 23:28 [entrez]2024/01/20 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1186/s12933-024-02125-1 [pii]2125 [pii]10.1186/s12933-024-02125-1 [doi]","epublish","Cardiovasc Diabetol. 2024 Jan 20;23(1):36. doi: 10.1186/s12933-024-02125-1.","© 2024.

In the general population, plasma lipidomic analysis can identify individuals at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether circulating lipid levels 12 weeks following a GDM pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Plasma lipid profiles containing >300 lipids were measured in 104 normal glucose-tolerant women 12 weeks following an index GDM pregnancy using electrospray-ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Women were assessed for 10 years for development of overt type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Among the 104 women with previous GDM, 21 (20%) developed diabetes during the median follow-up period of 8.5 years. Three lipid species, the cholesteryl ester species CE 20:4, the alkenylphosphatidylethanolamine species PE(P-36:2) and the phosphatidylserine species PS 38:4, were independently and positively associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. In a clinical model of prediction of type 2 diabetes that included age, BMI, and levels of pregnancy fasting glucose, postnatal fasting glucose, triacylglycerol and total cholesterol, the addition of these three lipid species resulted in an improvement in the net reclassification index of 22.3%. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The lipid species CE 20:4, PE(P-36:2) and PS 38:4 were significant risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes in women with a previous history of GDM.

Finding specific biomarkers to assist in diagnosing and treating patients with obese and T2DM is critical. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected liver tissues from obesity patients with and without T2DM for proteomic sequencing and immunohistochemistry assay. Analysis Gene Ontology(GO) enrichment, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG), and protein interaction network (PPI) were performed on the parameters and data derived from the Tandem Mass Tags(TMT)-based proteomics analysis of liver tissues. Transcriptome data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO)website and genes that are deferentially expressed in both transcriptome and proteome were selected. RESULTS: We identified 140 deferentially expressed proteins from proteomic sequencing. Six biomarkers were deferentially expressed in both proteome and transcriptome with consistent changes in direction. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis suggested CMPK1, the expression with greatest difference, was the core protein among the six biomarkers. Immunohistochemistry validated CMPK1 was upregulated significantly in the liver tissues of T2DM patients. The correlation analysis revealed that the expression of CMPK1 was significantly associated with key molecules in T2DM-related pathways at both protein and transcriptome levels. CONCLUSION AND NOVELTY: Our study showed CMPK1 was upregulated in the liver of T2DM patients and provides a possible new target for screening and diagnosing T2DM in patients with obese and a novel theoretical basis for the pathophysiological mechanism of obesity-related metabolic diseases.","Zhao, KangMao, RuiYi, WeiRen, ZhengyunLiu, YanjunYang, HuawuWang, SenlinFeng, Zhonghui","Zhao KMao RYi

T2DM results from insulin resistance of the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. In this study, we used proteomic and bioinformatic methodologies to identify novel hepatic membrane proteins that are related to the development of hepatic insulin resistance, steatosis, and T2DM. Using FT-ICR MS, we identified 95 significantly differentially expressed proteins in the membrane fraction of normal and T2DM db/db mouse liver. These proteins are primarily involved in energy metabolism pathways, molecular transport, and cellular signaling, and many of them have not previously been reported in diabetic studies. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that 16 proteins may be related to the regulation of insulin signaling in the liver. In addition, six proteins are associated with energy stress-induced, nine proteins with inflammatory stress-induced, and 14 proteins with endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced hepatic insulin resistance. Moreover, we identified 19 proteins that may regulate hepatic insulin resistance in a c-Jun amino-terminal kinase-dependent manner. In addition, three proteins, 14-3-3 protein beta (YWHAB), Slc2a4 (GLUT4), and Dlg4 (PSD-95), are discovered by comprehensive bioinformatic analysis, which have correlations with several proteins identified by proteomics approach. The newly identified proteins in T2DM should provide additional insight into the development and pathophysiology of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance, and they may serve as useful diagnostic markers and/or therapeutic targets for these diseases.","Kim, Gun-HwaPark, Edmond ChangkyunYun, Sung-HoHong, YeonheeLee, Dong-GyuShin, Eun-YoungJung, JongsunKim, Young HwanLee, Kyung-BokJang, Ik-SoonLee, Zee-WonChung, Young-HoChoi, Jong-SoonCheong, ChaejoonKim, SoohyunKim, Seung Il","Kim GHPark ECYun SHHong YLee DGShin EYJung JKim YHLee KBJang ISLee ZWChung YHChoi JSCheong CKim SKim SI","Division of Life Science, Korea Basic Science Institute, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20130226","Germany","Proteomics","Proteomics","101092707","0 (Membrane Proteins)0 (Proteome)EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)","IM","AnimalsComputational Biology/*methodsDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*metabolismEndoplasmic Reticulum StressInflammation/metabolismInsulin ResistanceJNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolismLipid MetabolismLiver/*metabolismMaleMass SpectrometryMembrane Proteins/*metabolismMiceMice, Inbred C57BLProtein Interaction MapsProteome/*metabolismProteomics/*methodsReproducibility of Results",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013/01/26 06:00","2013/09/21 06:00",NA,"2013/01/26 06:00","2012/05/23 00:00 [received]2012/12/27 00:00 [revised]2013/01/07 00:00 [accepted]2013/01/26 06:00 [entrez]2013/01/26 06:00 [pubmed]2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]","10.1002/pmic.201200210 [doi]","ppublish","Proteomics. 2013 Apr;13(7):1164-79. doi: 10.1002/pmic.201200210.

The study conducted a comparative protein expression analysis between healthy and recently diagnosed T2DM groups (discovery cohort). A candidate protein was then validated using enzyme-linked immune assay (ELISA) on serum samples collected from T2DM patients (n = 87) and healthy control (n = 60) (validation cohort). A total of 1074 proteins were identified, and 90 were significantly dysregulated between the two groups, including 32 newly associated with T2DM. Among these proteins, the expression of S100 calcium-binding protein A6 (S100A6) was validated by ELISA. It showed a significant increase in T2DM samples compared to the control group. It was evaluated as a biomarker using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, consistent with the DIA-MS results. Novel proteins are reported to be involved in the development and progression of T2DM.

In this study, metabolic profiling of blood samples collected from GDM, T2DM and control pregnant women was undertaken to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers in GDM/T2DM and compared to pregnancy outcome. METHODS: Sixty-seven pregnant women (21 controls, 32 GDM, 14 T2DM) in their second trimester underwent targeted metabolomics of plasma samples using tandem mass spectrometry with the Biocrates MxP(®) Quant 500 Kit. Linear regression models were used to identify the metabolic signature of GDM and T2DM, followed by generalized linear model (GLMNET) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine best predictors of GDM, T2DM and pre-term labor. RESULTS: The gestational age at delivery was 2 weeks earlier in T2DM compared to GDM and controls and correlated negatively with maternal HbA1C and systolic blood pressure and positively with serum albumin. Linear regression models revealed elevated glutamate and branched chain amino acids in GDM + T2DM group compared to controls. Regression models also revealed association of lower levels of triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols containing oleic and linoleic fatty acids with pre-term delivery. A generalized linear model ROC analyses revealed that that glutamate is the best predictors of GDM compared to controls (area under curve; AUC = 0.81). The model also revealed that phosphatidylcholine diacyl C40:2, arachidonic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, and phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C34:3 are the best predictors of GDM + T2DM compared to controls (AUC = 0.90). The model also revealed that the triacylglycerols C17:2/36:4 and C18:1/34:1 are the best predictors of pre-term delivery (≤ 37 weeks) (AUC = 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the metabolite alterations in women in their second trimester with diabetes mellitus and identifies predictive indicators of pre-term delivery. Future studies to confirm these associations in other cohorts and investigate their functional relevance and potential utilization for targeted therapies are warranted.","Diboun, IlhameRamanjaneya, ManjunathMajeed, YasserAhmed, LinaBashir, MohammedButler, Alexandra EAbou-Samra, Abdul BadiAtkin, Stephen LMazloum, Nayef AElrayess, Mohamed A","Diboun IRamanjaneya MMajeed YAhmed LBashir MButler AEAbou-Samra ABAtkin SLMazloum NAElrayess MAAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3803-4604","Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Translational Research Institute, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Doha, Qatar.Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Diabetes Research Center (DRC), Qatar Biomedical Research Institute (QBRI), Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Qatar Foundation (QF), PO Box 34110, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland Bahrain, Adliya, Kingdom of Bahrain.Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Doha, Qatar. nam2016@qatar-med.cornell.edu.Biomedical Research Center (BRC), Qatar University, Doha, Qatar. melrayess@adlqatar.qa.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20200924","England","J Transl Med","Journal of translational medicine","101190741",NA,"IM","*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2*Diabetes, GestationalFemaleHumansMetabolomics*Pre-EclampsiaPregnancyROC Curve","PMC7517617",NA,"NOTNLM","Gestational diabetesMetabolomicsPre-term deliveryPregnancyType 2 diabetes","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","2020/09/26 06:00","2021/05/15 06:00","2020/09/24","2020/09/25 05:32","2020/06/24 00:00 [received]2020/09/15 00:00 [accepted]2020/09/25 05:32 [entrez]2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]2020/09/24 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1186/s12967-020-02531-5 [pii]2531 [pii]10.1186/s12967-020-02531-5 [doi]","epublish","J Transl Med. 2020 Sep 24;18(1):366. doi: 10.1186/s12967-020-02531-5.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1186/s12967-020-02531-5",NA,2020

METHODS: Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics was used in a nested case-control study based on a screening sample of 64-year-old Caucasian women (n = 629). Candidate metabolic markers of T2D were identified in plasma obtained at baseline and the power to predict diabetes was tested in 69 incident cases occurring during 5.5 years follow-up. The metabolomics results were used as a standalone prediction model and in combination with established T2D predictive biomarkers for building eight T2D prediction models that were compared with each other based on their sensitivity and selectivity for predicting T2D. RESULTS: Established markers of T2D (impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance (HOMA), smoking, serum adiponectin)) alone, and in combination with metabolomics had the largest areas under the curve (AUC) (0.794 (95% confidence interval [0.738-0.850]) and 0.808 [0.749-0.867] respectively), with the standalone metabolomics model based on nine fasting plasma markers having a lower predictive power (0.657 [0.577-0.736]). Prediction based on non-blood based measures was 0.638 [0.565-0.711]). CONCLUSIONS: Established measures of T2D risk remain the best predictor of T2D risk in this population. Additional markers detected using metabolomics are likely related to these measures as they did not enhance the overall prediction in a combined model.","Savolainen, OttoFagerberg, BjörnVendelbo Lind, MadsSandberg, Ann-SofieRoss, Alastair BBergström, Göran","Savolainen OFagerberg BVendelbo Lind MSandberg ASRoss ABBergström G","Division of Food and Nutrition Science, Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.Wallenberg Laboratory for Cardiovascular Research at the Center for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Research, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy at Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.Division of Food and Nutrition Science, Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark.Division of Food and Nutrition Science, Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.Division of Food and Nutrition Science, Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20170710","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Area Under CurveBiomarkers/*metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*metabolismFemaleHumansIncidenceMetabolomeMetabolomics/*methodsMiddle AgedROC CurveRisk Factors","PMC5503163",NA,NA,NA,"Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2017/07/12 06:00","2017/09/26 06:00","2017/07/10","2017/07/11 06:00","2016/11/28 00:00 [received]2017/05/02 00:00 [accepted]2017/07/11 06:00 [entrez]2017/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]2017/07/10 00:00 [pmc-release]","PONE-D-16-47070 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0177738 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2017 Jul 10;12(7):e0177738. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0177738. eCollection 2017.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0177738",NA,2017

This study aims to evaluate the role of T2DM in the progression of endometrial hyperplasia. METHODS: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal (N) group, endometrial hyperplasia (NH) group, T2DM (T) group, and endometrial hyperplasia with T2DM (TH) group. Proteomics analysis was performed to determine the protein profile of endometrial tissues. Proliferation, migration, and invasion of cells with/without GLANT2-knockdown were assessed. Immunohistochemical staining and ELISA were used to examine the expression of GALNT2 in endometrial tissues and serum of clinical samples. RESULTS: The highest uterus index and endometrial thickness were observed in TH group, with the expression of proliferation marker PCNA increased significantly, indicating that T2DM facilitates the progress of endometrial hyperplasia. Proteomics analysis showed that there were significant differences in protein profiles among groups and differential proteins were mainly enriched in metabolic pathways. Further verification by molecular biology analysis indicated that GALNT2 is the key target for T2DM facilitating endometrial hyperplasia. The expression of GALNT2 was significantly decreased in high glucose environment. T2DM could synergize the proliferative function of GALNT2 aberration by activating EGFR/AKT/ERK pathway. The decreased expressions of GALNT2 in clinical samples were associated with worse subtypes of endometrial hyperplasia. CONCLUSION: T2DM promoted the progression of endometrial hyperplasia by regulating the GALNT2-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR and enhancing cell proliferation. GALNT2 has the potential to be a novel biomarker in the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia.","Zhou, XueyanXu, YinxueYin, DiZhao, FengHao, ZhixiangZhong, Ya'nanZhang, JingboZhang, BeiYin, Xiaoxing","Zhou XXu YYin DZhao FHao ZZhong YZhang JZhang BYin X","Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Drug Research and Clinical Pharmacy, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou Clinical School of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou Clinical School of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.

This study aims to develop a novel system of multidimensional network biomarkers (MDNBs) based on a widely targeted metabolomics approach to detect DR among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) efficiently. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this propensity score matching-based case-control study, we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry system for serum metabolites assessment of 69 pairs of patients with T2DM with DR (cases) and without DR (controls). Comprehensive analysis, including principal component analysis, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, generalized linear regression models and a 1000-times permutation test on metabolomics characteristics were conducted to detect candidate MDNBs depending on the discovery set. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was applied for the validation of capability and feasibility of MDNBs based on a separate validation set. RESULTS: We detected 613 features (318 in positive and 295 in negative ESI modes) in which 63 metabolites were highly relevant to the presence of DR. A panel of MDNBs containing linoleic acid, nicotinuric acid, ornithine and phenylacetylglutamine was determined based on the discovery set. Depending on the separate validation set, the area under the curve (95% CI), sensitivity and specificity of this MDNBs system were 0.92 (0.84 to 1.0), 96% and 78%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that metabolomics-based MDNBs are associated with the presence of DR and capable of distinguishing DR from T2DM efficiently. Our data also provide new insights into the mechanisms of DR and the potential value for new treatment targets development. Additional studies are needed to confirm our findings.","Zuo, JingjingLan, YuanHu, HonglinHou, XiangqingLi, JushuangWang, TaoZhang, HangZhang, NanaGuo, ChengnanPeng, FangZhao, ShuzhenWei, YapingJia, ChaonanZheng, ChaoMao, Guangyun","Zuo JAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6093-2684Lan YHu HHou XLi JWang TZhang HZhang NGuo CPeng FZhao SWei YJia CZheng CMao G","Eye Hospital and School of Ophthalmology and Optometry, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.National Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Center on Evidence-Based Medicine & Clinical Epidemiological Research, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Department of Ophthalmology, Pingxiang People's Hospital, Pingxiang, Jiangxi, China.Department of Endocrinology, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.Center on Evidence-Based Medicine & Clinical Epidemiological Research, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China.Center on Evidence-Based Medicine & Clinical Epidemiological Research, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Center on Evidence-Based Medicine & Clinical Epidemiological Research, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Department of Endocrinology, Wenzhou Medical University Second Affiliated Hospital, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Department of Endocrinology, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.Center on Evidence-Based Medicine & Clinical Epidemiological Research, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Center on Evidence-Based Medicine & Clinical Epidemiological Research, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Center on Evidence-Based Medicine & Clinical Epidemiological Research, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, College of Food Science and Nutritional Engineering, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.Taizhou Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Taizhou, Zhejiang, China.The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China mgy@wmu.edu.cn chao_zheng@zju.edu.cn.Eye Hospital and School of Ophthalmology and Optometry, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China mgy@wmu.edu.cn chao_zheng@zju.edu.cn.National Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Center on Evidence-Based Medicine & Clinical Epidemiological Research, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health & Management, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"England","BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care","BMJ open diabetes research & care","101641391","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","BiomarkersCase-Control Studies*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/diagnosis*Diabetic Retinopathy/diagnosisHumansMetabolomics","PMC7888330",NA,"NOTNLM","biomarkersdiabetes mellitusdiabetic retinopathytype 2","Competing interests: None declared.","2021/02/18 06:00","2021/07/01 06:00","2021/02/16","2021/02/17 05:43","2020/04/05 00:00 [received]2021/01/03 00:00 [revised]2021/01/26 00:00 [accepted]2021/02/17 05:43 [entrez]2021/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]2021/07/01 06:00 [medline]2021/02/16 00:00 [pmc-release]","9/1/e001443 [pii]bmjdrc-2020-001443 [pii]10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001443 [doi]","ppublish","BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care. 2021 Feb;9(1):e001443. doi: 10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001443.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Plasma samples were analyzed using PEA, with an Olink Target 96 cardiometabolic panel expressed as normalized protein expression (NPX) units. Results: Lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase (PRCP), Liver carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), Complement C2 (C2), and Intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM3) were lower in the DC and NC groups compared with the DN groups. Lithostathine-1-alpha (REG1A) and Immunoglobulin lambda constant 2 (IGLC2) were found higher in the DC group compared to DN and NC groups. ROC analysis suggested a significant ability of the six proteins to distinguish among the three groups (whole model test p < 0.0001, AUC 0.83-0.88), with a satisfactory discriminating performance in terms of sensitivity (77-90%) and specificity (70-90%). A possible role of IGLC2, PRCP, and REG1A in indicating kidney impairment was found, with a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 83%. Conclusions: The identified panel of six plasma proteins, using a targeted proteomic approach, provided evidence that these parameters could be considered in the chronic evolution of T2D and its complications.","Sartore, GiovanniPiarulli, FrancescoRagazzi, EugenioMallia, AliceGhilardi, StefaniaCarollo, MassimoLapolla, AnnunziataBanfi, Cristina","Sartore GAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5753-7114Piarulli FAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1193-4410Ragazzi EAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-0390-6823Mallia AAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7088-9074Ghilardi SCarollo MAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6523-6036Lapolla ABanfi CAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3346-9879","Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padova, 35122 Padova, Italy.Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padova, 35122 Padova, Italy.Studium Patavinum, University of Padova, 35122 Padova, Italy.Unit of Functional Proteomics, Metabolomics, and Network Analysis, Centro Cardiologico Monzino IRCCS, 20138 Milan, Italy.Unit of Functional Proteomics, Metabolomics, and Network Analysis, Centro Cardiologico Monzino IRCCS, 20138 Milan, Italy.Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padova, 35122 Padova, Italy.Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padova, 35122 Padova, Italy.Unit of Functional Proteomics, Metabolomics, and Network Analysis, Centro Cardiologico Monzino IRCCS, 20138 Milan, Italy.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20241011","Switzerland","Proteomes","Proteomes","101621966",NA,NA,NA,"PMC11503308",NA,"NOTNLM","cardiovascular diseasetargeted proteomicstype 2 diabetes","The authors declare no conflicts of interest.","2024/10/25 06:23","2024/10/25 06:24","2024/10/11","2024/10/25 03:03","2024/07/30 00:00 [received]2024/09/30 00:00 [revised]2024/10/09 00:00 [accepted]2024/10/25 06:24 [medline]2024/10/25 06:23 [pubmed]2024/10/25 03:03 [entrez]2024/10/11 00:00 [pmc-release]","proteomes12040029 [pii]proteomes-12-00029 [pii]10.3390/proteomes12040029 [doi]","epublish","Proteomes. 2024 Oct 11;12(4):29. doi: 10.3390/proteomes12040029.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/proteomes12040029",NA,2024

Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses have pointed to significant alterations in protein expression and function in beta cells exposed to diabetes like conditions (e.g., high glucose and/or saturated fatty acids levels). These nutritional overload stressful conditions are often defined as glucolipotoxic due to the progressive damage they cause to the cells. Our recent studies on the rat insulinoma-derived INS-1E beta cell line point to differential effects of such conditions in the phospholipid bilayers in beta cells.

In 2019, The UAE diabetes national prevalence was 15.4%. In recent years there has been a considerable investigation of predictive biomarkers associated with these conditions. This study analysed fasting (8 h) blood samples from an obese, normoglycemic cohort and an obese, T2DM cohort of UAE nationals, employing clinical chemistry analysis, 1D (1)H NMR and mass spectroscopy (FIA-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS) techniques. The novel findings reported for the first time in a UAE population revealed significant differences in a number of metabolites in the T2DM cohort. Metabolic fingerprints identified by NMR included BCAAs, trimethylamine N-oxide, β-hydroxybutyrate, trimethyl uric acid, and alanine. A targeted MS approach showed significant differences in lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, acylcarnitine, amino acids and sphingomyelins; Lyso.PC.a.C18.0, PC.ae.C34.2, C3.DC..C4.OH, glutamine and SM.C16.1, being the most significant metabolites. Pearson's correlation studies showed associations between these metabolites and the clinical chemistry parameters across both cohorts. This report identified differences in metabolites in response to T2DM in agreement with many published population studies. This contributes to the global search for a bank of metabolite biomarkers that can predict the advent of T2DM and give insight to its pathogenic mechanisms.","Fikri, Asma MSmyth, RosemaryKumar, VijayAl-Abadla, ZainabAbusnana, SalahedeenMunday, Michael R","Fikri AMSmyth RKumar VAl-Abadla ZAbusnana SMunday MR","Ministry of Health and Prevention, Dubai, UAE. dr.asma.fikri@gmail.com.Rahsid Centre for Diabetes and Research, Ajman, UAE. dr.asma.fikri@gmail.com.Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy, London, UK.Rahsid Centre for Diabetes and Research, Ajman, UAE.Rahsid Centre for Diabetes and Research, Ajman, UAE.Rahsid Centre for Diabetes and Research, Ajman, UAE.Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy, London, UK. michael.munday@ucl.ac.uk.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20201019","England","Sci Rep","Scientific reports","101563288","0 (Amino Acids, Branched-Chain)0 (Biomarkers)0 (Methylamines)268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)FLD0K1SJ1A (trimethyloxamine)OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)TZP1275679 (3-Hydroxybutyric Acid)","IM","3-Hydroxybutyric Acid/bloodAdultAlanine/bloodAmino Acids, Branched-Chain/bloodBiomarkers/*bloodChromatography, LiquidDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*diagnosis/etiologyFemaleHumansMaleMetabolomicsMethylamines/bloodMiddle AgedObesity/blood/*complicationsTandem Mass SpectrometryUnited Arab EmiratesUric Acid/bloodYoung Adult","PMC7572402",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare no competing interests.","2020/10/21 06:00","2021/01/20 06:00","2020/10/19","2020/10/20 06:18","2020/02/11 00:00 [received]2020/09/16 00:00 [accepted]2020/10/20 06:18 [entrez]2020/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]2021/01/20 06:00 [medline]2020/10/19 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1038/s41598-020-73384-7 [pii]73384 [pii]10.1038/s41598-020-73384-7 [doi]","epublish","Sci Rep. 2020 Oct 19;10(1):17616. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-73384-7.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/s41598-020-73384-7",NA,2020

Being a heterogeneous metabolic condition, it is pertinent to understand the metabolites and metabolic pathways that are altered during the development and progression of IR toward T2DM. Serum samples were collected from C57BL/6J mice fed with HFD or chow diet (CD) for 16 weeks. Collected samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Data on the identified raw metabolites were evaluated using a combination of univariate and multivariate statistical methods. Mice fed with HFD had glucose and insulin intolerance associated with impairment of insulin signaling in key metabolic tissues. From the GC-MS/MS analysis of serum samples, a total of 75 common annotated metabolites were identified between HFDand CD-fed mice. In the t-test, 22 significantly altered metabolites were identified. Out of these, 16 metabolites were up-accumulated, whereas 6 metabolites were down-accumulated. Pathway analysis identified 4 significantly altered metabolic pathways. In particular, primary bile acid biosynthesis and linoleic acid metabolism were upregulated, whereas the TCA cycle and pentose and glucuronate interconversion were downregulated in HFD-fed mice in comparison to CD-fed mice. These results show the distinct metabolic profiles associated with the onset of IR that could provide promising metabolic biomarkers for diagnostic and clinical applications.","Tomar, Manendra SinghSharma, AdityaAraniti, FabrizioPateriya, AnkitShrivastava, AshutoshTamrakar, Akhilesh Kumar","Tomar MSSharma AAraniti FPateriya AShrivastava AAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5113-3258Tamrakar AK","Centre for Advance Research, Faculty of Medicine, King George's Medical University, Lucknow 226003, India.Division of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, India.Dipartimento di Scienze Agrarie e Ambientali-Produzione, Territorio, Agroenergia, Università degli Studi di Milano, Via Celoria 2, 20133 Milano, Italy.Centre for Advance Research, Faculty of Medicine, King George's Medical University, Lucknow 226003, India.Centre for Advance Research, Faculty of Medicine, King George's Medical University, Lucknow 226003, India.Division of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow 226031, India.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20230421","United States","ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci","ACS pharmacology & translational science","101721411",NA,NA,NA,"PMC10186361",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare no competing financial interest.","2023/05/18 19:12","2023/05/18 19:13","2024/04/21","2023/05/18 16:46","2023/02/11 00:00 [received]2023/05/18 19:13 [medline]2023/05/18 19:12 [pubmed]2023/05/18 16:46 [entrez]2024/04/21 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1021/acsptsci.3c00028 [doi]","epublish","ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci. 2023 Apr 21;6(5):771-782. doi: 10.1021/acsptsci.3c00028. eCollection 2023 May 12.","© 2023 American Chemical Society.",NA,NA,"10.1021/acsptsci.3c00028",NA,2023

The aim of the present study was to explore the effects of silybin on protein expression in obese mice. Firstly, serum was collected, and it was used to detect serum lipids and other serological indicators. Secondly, total protein from epididymal adipose tissue was extracted for differential expression analysis by quantitative tandem mass tag (TMT) combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), followed by bioinformatics and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses of these proteins. Lastly, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) were used to further validate the expression of identified differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) at the mRNA and protein level, respectively. The results revealed that silybin could improve abnormal lipid metabolism caused by the high fat diet in obese mice. A total of 341, 538 and 243 DEPs were found in the high fat/control (WF/WC), silybin/high fat (WS/WF) and WS/WC groups, respectively. These DEPs mainly participated in lipid metabolism and energy metabolism. Notably, tropomyosin 1 (TPM1), myosin light chain 2 (MYL2), myosin heavy chain 11 (MYH11) and other DEPs were involved in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy and other pathways. Silybin could protect cardiac function by inducing the protein expression of TPM1, MYL2 and MYH11 in the adipose tissue of obese mice.","Wang, FeiLi, ZelinSong, TiantianJia, YujiaoQi, LicuiRen, LupingChen, Shuchun","Wang FLi ZSong TJia YQi LRen LChen S","Department of Endocrinology, Hebei General Hospital, Graduate School of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhaung, China.Department of Endocrinology, Hebei General Hospital, Graduate School of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhaung, China.Department of Endocrinology, Hebei General Hospital, Graduate School of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhaung, China.Department of Endocrinology, Hebei General Hospital, Graduate School of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhaung, China.Department of Endocrinology, Hebei General Hospital, Graduate School of Hebei North University, Shijiazhaung, China.Department of Endocrinology, Hebei General Hospital, Shijiazhaung, 050000, Hebei, China.Department of Endocrinology, Hebei General Hospital, Graduate School of Hebei North University, No. 348 Heping West Road, Shijiazhaung, 050000, Hebei, China. chenshuchunwork88@163.com.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleValidation Study","20210330","England","Sci Rep","Scientific reports","101563288","0 (Protective Agents)0 (Proteome)4RKY41TBTF (Silybin)","IM","Adipose Tissue/drug effects/metabolismAnimalsCardiomyopathies/etiology/*prevention & controlDrug Evaluation, PreclinicalLipid Metabolism/*drug effectsMaleMice, Inbred C57BLObesity/complications/*drug therapyProtective Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic useProteome/drug effectsSilybin/pharmacology/*therapeutic useMice","PMC8009917",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare no competing interests.","2021/04/01 06:00","2021/10/26 06:00","2021/03/30","2021/03/31 06:28","2020/09/29 00:00 [received]2021/03/19 00:00 [accepted]2021/03/31 06:28 [entrez]2021/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]2021/03/30 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1038/s41598-021-86717-x [pii]86717 [pii]10.1038/s41598-021-86717-x [doi]","epublish","Sci Rep. 2021 Mar 30;11(1):7136. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-86717-x.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/s41598-021-86717-x",NA,2021

To elucidate the underlying changes associated with obesity, we performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in the liver and plasma of obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and integrated these data with publicly available transcriptomic and proteomic datasets of obesity and metabolic diseases in preclinical and clinical cohorts. We quantified 7173 and 555 proteins in the liver and plasma proteomes, respectively. The abundance of proteins related to fatty acid metabolism were increased, alongside peroxisomal proliferation in ob/ob liver. Putatively secreted proteins and the secretory machinery were also dysregulated in the liver, which was mirrored by a substantial alteration of the plasma proteome. Greater than 50% of the plasma proteins were differentially regulated, including NAFLD biomarkers, lipoproteins, the 20S proteasome, and the complement and coagulation cascades of the immune system. Integration of the liver and plasma proteomes identified proteins that were concomitantly regulated in the liver and plasma in obesity, suggesting that the systemic abundance of these plasma proteins is regulated by secretion from the liver. Many of these proteins are systemically regulated during type 2 diabetes and/or NAFLD in humans, indicating the clinical importance of liver-plasma cross talk and the relevance of our investigations in ob/ob mice. Together, these analyses yield a comprehensive insight into obesity and provide an extensive resource for obesity research in a prevailing model organism.","Stocks, BenGonzalez-Franquesa, AlbaBorg, Melissa LBjörnholm, MarieNiu, LiliZierath, Juleen RDeshmukh, Atul S","Stocks BGonzalez-Franquesa ABorg MLBjörnholm MNiu LZierath JRDeshmukh AS","Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.

A shotgun proteomics approach was applied to identify proteins differentially expressed between type 2 diabetic (TallyHo) and control (SWR/J) mice in the bladder smooth muscle and urothelium, separately. We were able to identify 1760 nonredundant proteins from the detrusor smooth muscle and 3169 nonredundant proteins from urothelium. Pathway and network analysis of significantly dysregulated proteins was conducted to investigate the molecular processes associated with diabetes. This pinpointed ERK1/2 signaling as a key regulatory node in the diabetes-induced pathophysiology for both tissue types. The detrusor muscle samples showed diabetes-induced increased tissue remodeling-type events such as Actin Cytoskeleton Signaling and Signaling by Rho Family GTPases. The diabetic urothelium samples exhibited oxidative stress responses, as seen in the suppression of protein expression for key players in the NRF2-Mediated Oxidative Stress Response pathway. These results suggest that diabetes induced elevated inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and tissue remodeling are involved in the development of tissue specific diabetic bladder dysfunctions. Validation of signaling dysregulation as a function of diabetes was performed using Western blotting. These data illustrated changes in ERK1/2 phosphorylation as a function of diabetes, with significant decreases in diabetes-associated phosphorylation in urothelium, but the opposite effect in detrusor muscle. These data highlight the importance of understanding tissue specific effects of disease process in understanding pathophysiology in complex disease and pave the way for future studies to better understand important molecular targets in reversing bladder dysfunction.","Tomechko, Sara ELiu, GuimingTao, MingfangSchlatzer, DanielaPowell, C ThomasGupta, SanjayChance, Mark RDaneshgari, Firouz","Tomechko SELiu GTao MSchlatzer DPowell CTGupta SChance MRDaneshgari F","From the ‡Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics.§Urology Institute, University Hospitals Case Medical Center and Department of Urology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, 44106 guiming.liu@case.edu.§Urology Institute, University Hospitals Case Medical Center and Department of Urology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, 44106.From the ‡Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics.§Urology Institute, University Hospitals Case Medical Center and Department of Urology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, 44106.§Urology Institute, University Hospitals Case Medical Center and Department of Urology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, 44106.From the ‡Center for Proteomics and Bioinformatics.§Urology Institute, University Hospitals Case Medical Center and Department of Urology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, 44106.","eng","P20 DK090871/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR01 DK083733/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesP20 DK09087/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., Extramural","20150108","United States","Mol Cell Proteomics","Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP","101125647","0 (Proteome)","IM","AnimalsDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*metabolism/pathologyGene Expression RegulationGene Regulatory NetworksMaleMiceMuscle, Smooth/*metabolismOrgan SpecificityProteome/*analysisProteomics/methodsSignal TransductionUrinary Bladder/*cytology/metabolismUrothelium/*metabolism","PMC4349983",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015/01/13 06:00","2015/12/15 06:00","2016/03/01","2015/01/10 06:00","2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]2016/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","S1535-9476(20)33228-X [pii]M114.041863 [pii]10.1074/mcp.M114.041863 [doi]","ppublish","Mol Cell Proteomics. 2015 Mar;14(3):635-45. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M114.041863.

Dapagliflozin is a selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) that improves the insulin sensitivity of the liver and peripheral tissues. Many studies confirmed that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce blood glucose and have multiple beneficial effects such as weight loss, lipid regulation, and kidney protection. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of the renal and cardiovascular protective effects of dapagliflozin from the perspective of differentially expressed proteins in the serum of T2DM patients have not been intensively explored so far. AIM: To identify differentially expressed proteins associated with dapagliflozin treatment in patients with T2DM. METHODS: Twenty T2DM patients [hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 7.0%-10.0%] were enrolled at The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University between January 1, 2017 and December 1, 2018. They received dapagliflozin (10 mg/d) for 3 mo, and the HbA1c < 7.0% target was achieved. The changes in clinical indexes were compared before and after treatments. Label-free quantitative proteomics was used to identify differentially expressed proteins using the serum samples of five patients. The identified differentially expressed proteins were analyzed using various bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Dapagliflozin significantly improved the clinical manifestation of the patients. There were 18 downregulated proteins and one upregulated protein in the serum samples of patients after dapagliflozin administration. Bioinformatics analyses, including subcellular localization, EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotations, were used to profile the biological characteristics of the 19 differentially expressed proteins. Based on the literature and function enrichment analysis, two downregulated proteins, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and alpha II B integrin (ITGA2B), and one upregulated protein, podocalyxin (PCX), were selected for enzyme linked immunosorbent assay validation. These validated differentially expressed proteins had multiple correlations with clinical indexes, including HbAc1 and fasting C-peptide. CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin has hypoglycemic effects and regulates the serum expressions of MPO, ITGA2B, and PCX, possibly contributing to the effects of dapagliflozin on oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and lipid metabolism.","Zhao, Yan-XueBorjigin, SarulYan, Zhao-Li","Zhao YXBorjigin SYan ZL","Basic Building Laboratory, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010000, Inner Mongolia, China.Department of Endocrinology, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010000, Inner Mongolia, China.Department of Endocrinology, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010000, Inner Mongolia, China. aliceyzl@126.com.","eng",NA,"Journal Article",NA,"United States","World J Diabetes","World journal of diabetes","101547524",NA,NA,NA,"PMC8984562",NA,"NOTNLM","Alpha II B integrinDapagliflozinMyeloperoxidaseNon-standard quantitative proteomicsPodocalyxinType 2 diabetes mellitus","Conflict-of-interest statement: The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","2022/04/19 06:00","2022/04/19 06:01","2022/03/15","2022/04/18 06:35","2021/10/30 00:00 [received]2022/01/29 00:00 [revised]2022/02/23 00:00 [accepted]2022/04/18 06:35 [entrez]2022/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]2022/04/19 06:01 [medline]2022/03/15 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.4239/wjd.v13.i3.224 [doi]","ppublish","World J Diabetes. 2022 Mar 15;13(3):224-239. doi: 10.4239/wjd.v13.i3.224.","©The Author(s) 2022.

In this paper, we focused on insulin target organs: adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle, and analyzed the different pathological processes of IR in these three tissues based on proteomics research. By literature studies, we proposed that the main pathological processes of IR among target organs were diverse, which showed unique characteristics and focuses. We further summarized the differential proteins in target organs which were verified to be related to IR, and discussed the proteins that may play key roles in the emphasized pathological processes, aiming at discovering potentially specific differential proteins of IR, and providing new ideas for pathological mechanism research of IR.","Li, YaqiMa, QuantaoLi, PengfeiWang, JingkangWang, MinFan, YuanyuanWang, TieshanWang, ChunguoWang, TingZhao, Baosheng","Li YAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-0721-0951Ma QLi PWang JWang MFan YWang TWang CWang TZhao B","School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.Beijing Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.Beijing Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.Beijing Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.Beijing Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tReview","20200301","United States","J Cell Physiol","Journal of cellular physiology","0050222","0 (Insulin)","IM","Adipose Tissue/*metabolismAnimalsDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolismHumansInsulin/metabolismInsulin Resistance/*physiologyLiver/*metabolismMuscle, Skeletal/*metabolismProteomics/methods",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","adipose tissuediabetes mellitus Type 2insulin resistancelivermuscleproteomicsskeletal",NA,"2020/03/03 06:00","2021/03/05 06:00",NA,"2020/03/03 06:00","2019/07/29 00:00 [received]2020/02/12 00:00 [accepted]2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]2021/03/05 06:00 [medline]2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]","10.1002/jcp.29658 [doi]","ppublish","J Cell Physiol. 2020 Oct;235(10):6441-6461. doi: 10.1002/jcp.29658.

The objective of this study is to identify distinct metabolites of NAFLD patients with or without T2DM. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a biomarker-discovery population to find distinct metabolites of NAFLD patients with or without T2DM. Then, a validation population was applied to test the model of the biomarker-discovery population. All the individuals received anthropometric and common biochemical measurements. The metabolic data were analyzed by multivariable statistical analyses using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: There were 7, 7, 2 metabolites in the positive electrospray ionization (ESI(+)) mode, which were identified between groups from both the biomarker-discovery and validation population. The NAFLD group showed higher concentrations of oleamide, l-phenylalanine, l-proline, bilirubin, l-palmitoylcarnitine, and PC (20:5) and a lower concentration of Lyso-PAF C-18 than those of control. Compared with the control group, the NAFLD+T2DM group displayed higher oleamide, l-leucine, LysoPC (14:0), bilirubin, tetradecenoylcarnitine, linoleyl carnitine, and tetradecadiencarnitine in serum. Tetradecenoylcarnitine and tetradecadiencarnitine were more elevated in patients with NAFLD+T2DM than in the NAFLD group. CONCLUSIONS: Serum metabonomic analyses displayed great metabolic changes in patients with NAFLD and NAFLD plus T2DM. Our study is beneficial in providing a further view into the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of NAFLD and NAFLD plus T2DM, which might be useful for the prevention and therapy of NAFLD and NAFLD plus T2DM.","Chen, YangLi, ChunlongLiu, LiyanGuo, FuchuanLi, SongtaoHuang, LinaSun, ChanghaoFeng, Rennan","Chen YLi CLiu LGuo FLi SHuang LSun CFeng R","Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.Department of General Surgery, The second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.Office of the Secretariat, Liaoning Institute for Food Control, Shenyang, China.Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.

To obtain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PTDM development and early glomerular damage before the development of histologically visible diabetic kidney disease, we comparatively analysed the proteome of histologically normal glomeruli from patients with PTDM and normoglycaemic (NG) transplant recipients. Moreover, to assess specificities inherent in PTDM, we also comparatively evaluated glomerular proteomes from transplant recipients with preexisting type 2 DM (T2DM). METHODS: Protocol biopsies were obtained from adult NG, PTDM and T2DM patients one year after kidney transplantation. Biopsies were formalin-fixed and embedded in paraffin, and glomerular cross-sections were microdissected. A total of 4 NG, 7 PTDM and 6 T2DM kidney biopsies were used for the analysis. The proteome was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Relative differences in protein abundance and significantly dysregulated pathways were analysed. RESULTS: Proteins involved in cell adhesion, immune response, leukocyte transendothelial filtration, and cell localization and organization were less abundant in glomeruli from PTDM patients than in those from NG patients, and proteins associated with supramolecular fibre organization and protein-containing complex binding were more abundant in PTDM patients. Overall, proteins related to adherens and tight junctions and those related to the immune system, including leukocyte transendothelial migration, were more abundant in NG patients than in transplanted patients with DM, irrespective of the timing of its development. However, proteins included in cell‒cell junctions and adhesion, insulin resistance, and vesicle-mediated transport were all less abundant in PTDM patients than in T2DM patients. CONCLUSIONS: The glomerular proteome profile differentiates PTDM from NG and T2DM, suggesting specific pathogenetic mechanisms. Further studies are warranted to validate these results, potentially leading to an improved understanding of PTDM kidney transplant pathophysiology and to the identification of novel biomarkers.","Kipp, AnneMarti, Hans-PeterBabickova, JankaNakken, SigridLeh, SabineHalden, Thea A SJenssen, TrondVikse, Bjørn EgilÅsberg, AndersSpagnoli, GiulioFurriol, Jessica","Kipp AMarti HPBabickova JNakken SLeh SHalden TASJenssen TVikse BEÅsberg ASpagnoli GFurriol JAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8842-534X","Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.Institute of Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia.Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.Department of Pathology, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.Department of Transplantation Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.Department of Transplantation Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.Metabolic and Renal Research Group, Faculty of Health Sciences UiT, The Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway.Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.Department of Medicine, Haugesund Hospital, Haugesund, Norway.Department of Transplantation Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.Department of Pharmacy, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.Institute of Translational Pharmacology, National Research Council, Rome, Italy.Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.

METHODS: Random urine samples obtained from 28 patients with T2DM and 29 healthy individuals were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) after purification using weak cationic-exchange magnetic beads (MB-WCX). Then the generated mass spectra of peptides were analyzed by ClinProTools2.1 bioinformatics software. Subsequently, the amino acid sequences of differently expressed peptides were identified by a nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and a Sequest search found the corresponding protein name. RESULTS: Three differently expressed peptides and their mass to charge ratios (m/z) were found. Compared with healthy controls, the peak areas of the three differently expressed peptides were all reduced in T2DM, and the m/z were 1056.1 (m/z), 1963.5 (m/z), 2123.5 (m/z), respectively. The above-mentioned peptides were further identified as fragments of histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1), bifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), and clusterin precursor protein (CLU). CONCLUSIONS: Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1, bifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, and clusterin precursor protein may serve as potential biomarkers distinguishing type 2 diabetes mellitus patients from healthy controls.","Chu, LinaFu, GuangzhenMeng, QianZhou, HuiZhang, Man","Chu LFu GMeng QZhou HZhang M","The Ninth Clinical Medical College of Peking University, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20130613","Ireland","Diabetes Res Clin Pract","Diabetes research and clinical practice","8508335","0 (Biomarkers)0 (CLU protein, human)0 (Clusterin)0 (HINT1 protein, human)0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)EC 6.1.1.

METHODS: A nested case-control design was applied with 440 cases of incident T2D and 440 controls, randomly sampled from all 65-75 year-old study participants of the ESTHER study, which is a population-based German cohort study with 14 years of follow-up. Analyses of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGuo; DNA oxidation product) and 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-oxo-Guo; RNA oxidation product) were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The sum of the two OxGuo molecule concentrations was calculated and called OxGuo-UPLC-MS/MS. The corresponding OxGuo-ELISA levels were measured by Cayman's DNA/RNA oxidative damage ELISA, which detects a mix of 8-oxo-dGuo, 8-oxo-Guo and one other OxGuo molecule. Logistic regression was applied and models were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, HbA(1c), and C-reactive protein levels. RESULTS: 8-oxo-dGuo and 8-oxo-Guo were highly correlated with each other (r = 0.642) and weakly correlated with OxGuo-ELISA (r = 0.22 and r = 0.14, respectively). OxGuo-ELISA levels were statistically significant associated with T2D incidence (odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval [95%CI] for comparison of top and bottom quartile: 1.77 [1.14; 2.76]). In contrast, the ORs did not increase stepwise from quartile 2 to 4 for neither 8-oxo-Guo, 8-oxo-dGuo levels nor OxGuo-UPLC-MS/MS and comparisons of top and bottom quartile were not statistically significant. In a post-hoc analysis comparing bottom quartile 1 with a combined group of quartile 2-4, the association of OxGuo-UPLC-MS/MS with T2D incidence reached statistical significance (OR [95%CI]: 0.66 [0.46; 0.96]) and was very similar with the one obtained for OxGuo-ELISA (OR [95%CI]: 0.66 [0.45; 0.95]). CONCLUSIONS: Although only the measurements of the DNA/RNA oxidative damage ELISA kit of Cayman were statistically significantly associated with T2D incidence in the main analysis, confidence intervals overlapped and the post-hoc analysis showed that results for OxGuo-UPLC-MS/MS were quite comparable.","Schöttker, BenLarsen, Emil LWeimann, AllanHenriksen, TrineBrenner, HermannPoulsen, Henrik E","Schöttker BLarsen ELWeimann AHenriksen TBrenner HPoulsen HE","Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Ageing Research, German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 581, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany; Network Aging Research, University of Heidelberg, Bergheimer Straße 20, 69115, Heidelberg, Germany.

Whether it is also a determinant of mortality and cardiovascular disease in patients with microalbuminuria (MA) is unknown. METHODS: Urine samples were obtained from 155 patients with type 2 diabetes and confirmed microalbuminuria. Proteomic analysis was undertaken using capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry to determine the CKD273 classifier score. A previously defined CKD273 threshold of 0.343 for identification of DN was used to categorise the cohort in Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models with all-cause mortality as the primary endpoint. Outcomes were traced through national health registers after 6 years. RESULTS: CKD273 correlated with urine albumin excretion rate (UAER) (r = 0.481, p = <0.001), age (r = 0.238, p = 0.003), coronary artery calcium (CAC) score (r = 0.236, p = 0.003), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (r = 0.190, p = 0.018) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (r = 0.265, p = 0.001). On multivariate analysis only UAER (β = 0.402, p < 0.001) and eGFR (β = - 0.184, p = 0.039) were statistically significant determinants of CKD273. Twenty participants died during follow-up. CKD273 was a determinant of mortality (log rank [Mantel-Cox] p = 0.004), and retained significance (p = 0.048) after adjustment for age, sex, blood pressure, NT-proBNP and CAC score in a Cox regression model. CONCLUSION: A multidimensional biomarker can provide information on outcomes associated with its primary diagnostic purpose. Here we demonstrate that the urinary proteomic classifier CKD273 is associated with mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes and MA even when adjusted for other established cardiovascular and renal biomarkers.","Currie, Gemma Evon Scholten, Bernt JohanMary, SheonFlores Guerrero, Jose-LuisLindhardt, MortenReinhard, HenrikJacobsen, Peter KMullen, WilliamParving, Hans-HenrikMischak, HaraldRossing, PeterDelles, Christian","Currie GEAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-0797-0224von Scholten BJMary SFlores Guerrero JLAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6094-2206Lindhardt MReinhard HJacobsen PKMullen WParving HHMischak HRossing PDelles C","Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, 126 University Place, Glasgow, G12 8TA, UK. gemma.currie@glasgow.ac.uk.Steno Diabetes Center, Gentofte, Copenhagen, Denmark.Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, 126 University Place, Glasgow, G12 8TA, UK.Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, 126 University Place, Glasgow, G12 8TA, UK.Steno Diabetes Center, Gentofte, Copenhagen, Denmark.Steno Diabetes Center, Gentofte, Copenhagen, Denmark.Steno Diabetes Center, Gentofte, Copenhagen, Denmark.Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, 126 University Place, Glasgow, G12 8TA, UK.Steno Diabetes Center, Gentofte, Copenhagen, Denmark.Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, 126 University Place, Glasgow, G12 8TA, UK.Mosaiques Diagnostics, Hanover, Germany.Steno Diabetes Center, Gentofte, Copenhagen, Denmark.HEALTH, University of Aarhus, Aarhus, Denmark.Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, 126 University Place, Glasgow, G12 8TA, UK.","eng","279277/Seventh Framework Programme/InternationalINCN-2015-20/Commonwealth Scholarship Commission/InternationalRE/13/5/30177/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom","Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20180406","England","Cardiovasc Diabetol","Cardiovascular diabetology","101147637","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","AdultAgedAlbuminuria/diagnosis/*mortality/*urineBiomarkers/urineCross-Sectional StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/diagnosis/*mortality/*urineDiabetic Nephropathies/diagnosis/*mortality/*urineElectrophoresis, CapillaryFemaleHumansLongitudinal StudiesMaleMass SpectrometryMiddle AgedPredictive Value of TestsPrognosisProteomics/*methodsRisk FactorsTime FactorsUrinalysis","PMC5889591",NA,"NOTNLM","BiomarkersDiabetesMicroalbuminuriaMortalityProteomics",NA,"2018/04/08 06:00","2019/01/29 06:00","2018/04/06","2018/04/08 06:00","2018/01/24 00:00 [received]2018/04/02 00:00 [accepted]2018/04/08 06:00 [entrez]2018/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]2019/01/29 06:00 [medline]2018/04/06 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1186/s12933-018-0697-9 [pii]697 [pii]10.1186/s12933-018-0697-9 [doi]","epublish","Cardiovasc Diabetol. 2018 Apr 6;17(1):50. doi: 10.1186/s12933-018-0697-9.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1186/s12933-018-0697-9",NA,2018

To prevent the dreadful consequence, development of new assays for diagnostic of DKD has always been the priority in the research field of diabetic complications. At present, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are the standard methods for assessing glomerular damage and renal function changes in clinical practice. However, due to diverse tissue involvement in different individuals, the so-called ""non-albuminuric renal impairment"" is not uncommon, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, the precision of creatinine-based GFR estimates is limited in hyperfiltration status. These facts make albuminuria and eGFR less reliable indicators for early-stage DKD. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of DKD, along with the elucidation of its genetic profiles and phenotypic expression of different molecules. With the help of ever-evolving technologies, it has gradually become plausible to apply the thriving information in clinical practice. The strength and weakness of several novel biomarkers, genomic, proteomic and metabolomic signatures in assisting the early diagnosis of DKD will be discussed in this article.","Lin, Chih-HungChang, Yi-ChengChuang, Lee-Ming","Lin CHChang YCChuang LM","Chih-Hung Lin, Yi-Cheng Chang, Lee-Ming Chuang, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei 100, Taiwan.Chih-Hung Lin, Yi-Cheng Chang, Lee-Ming Chuang, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei 100, Taiwan.Chih-Hung Lin, Yi-Cheng Chang, Lee-Ming Chuang, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei 100, Taiwan.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleReview",NA,"United States","World J Diabetes","World journal of diabetes","101547524",NA,NA,NA,"PMC4958689",NA,"NOTNLM","BiomarkersDiabetic kidney diseaseEarly diagnosisGenomics",NA,"2016/08/16 06:00","2016/08/16 06:01","2016/07/25","2016/08/16 06:00","2016/03/28 00:00 [received]2016/05/29 00:00 [revised]2016/06/27 00:00 [accepted]2016/08/16 06:00 [entrez]2016/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]2016/08/16 06:01 [medline]2016/07/25 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.4239/wjd.v7.i14.290 [doi]","ppublish","World J Diabetes. 2016 Jul 25;7(14):290-301. doi: 10.4239/wjd.v7.i14.290.",NA,NA,NA,"10.4239/wjd.v7.i14.290",NA,2016

Changes in mouse liver proteins were identified using iTRAQ, offline 2D LC (SCX and RP) and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. A total of 1639 proteins was quantified during 3-15 weeks of disease progression and a pronounced proteome change was captured by incorporating the statistical analysis and network analysis. This underscores the importance of protein expression profiles involved in different biological processes that correlate well with the disease progression. The functionally important modules with key hub proteins such as Egfr, Pklr, Suclg1, and Pcx (Carbohydrate metabolism), Cyp2e1, Fasn, Acat1, and Hmgcs2 (Lipid metabolism and ketogenesis), and Gpx1, Mgst1, and Sod2 (ROS metabolism) can be linked to a physiological state of obesity and T2D.

To assess in vitro phenotypic changes, M1 and M2 polarised Type 2 diabetic rat (Goto Kakizaki, GK) macrophages were cultured on micro-rough (SLA) or hydrophilic nanostructured SLA (modSLA) titanium. The in vivo effects of the SLA and modSLA surfaces on macrophage phenotype, wound-associated protein expression and bone formation were investigated using a critical-sized calvarial defect model. Compared to healthy macrophages, GK M2 macrophage function was compromised, secreting significantly lower levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The modSLA surface attenuated the pro-inflammatory cellular environment, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and promoting M2 macrophage phenotype differentiation. ModSLA also suppressed gene expression associated with macrophage multinucleation and giant cell formation and stimulated pro-osteogenic genes in co-cultured osteoblasts. In vivo, modSLA enhanced osteogenesis compared to SLA in GK rats. During early healing, proteomic analysis of both surface adherent and wound exudate material showed that modSLA promoted an immunomodulatory pro-reparative environment. The modSLA surface therefore successfully compensated for the compromised M2 macrophage function in Type 2 diabetes by attenuating the pro-inflammatory response and promoting M2 macrophage activity, thus restoring macrophage homeostasis and resulting in a cellular environment favourable for enhanced osseous healing.","Lee, Ryan S BHamlet, Stephen MMoon, Ho-JinIvanovski, Saso","Lee RSBHamlet SMMoon HJIvanovski S","The University of Queensland, School of Dentistry, Herston, Australia; School of Dentistry and Oral Health, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.School of Dentistry and Oral Health, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia; Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.Department of Dental Materials, School of Dentistry, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.The University of Queensland, School of Dentistry, Herston, Australia.

GLP-1 concentration and hepatic genes related to bile acid synthesis were also investigated. The results showed that the concentrations of individual bile acids varied notably both interindividually and temporally. However, plasma, urine and feces samples displayed discriminating bile acid profiles between the db/db and wt groups, with the plasma profile showing the best differentiation capacity. In plasma and urine, the concentration variation of taurine-conjugated bile acids was more correlated with that of other taurine-conjugated bile acids, and vice versa for the unconjugated bile acids. Transcription of hepatic gene Cyp7b1 was downregulated, and Hsd3b7 upregulated in db/db mice.

However, DKD patients couldn't be diagnosed early due to lack of special biomarkers. Urine is an ideal non-invasive sample for screening DKD biomarkers. This study aims to explore DKD special biomarkers by urinary proteomics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: According to the result of renal biopsy, 142 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients were divided into 2 groups: DKD (n = 83) and NDRD (n = 59). Ten patients were selected from each group to define urinary protein profiles by label-free quantitative proteomics. The candidate proteins were further verifyied by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) methods (n = 40). Proteins which perform the same trend both in PRM and proteomics were verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) with expanding the sample size (n = 82). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic biomarkers. RESULTS: We identified 417 peptides in urinary proteins showing significant difference between DKD and NDRD. PRM verification identified C7, SERPINA4, IGHG1, SEMG2, PGLS, GGT1, CDH2, CDH1 was consistent with the proteomic results and p < 0.05. Three potential biomarkers for DKD, C7, SERPINA4, and gGT1, were verified by ELISA. The combinatied SERPINA4/Ucr and gGT1/Ucr (AUC = 0.758, p = 0.001) displayed higher diagnostic efficiency than C7/Ucr (AUC = 0.632, p = 0.048), SERPINA4/Ucr (AUC = 0.661, p = 0.032), and gGT1/Ucr (AUC = 0.661, p = 0.029) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The combined index SERPINA4/Ucr and gGT1/Ucr can be considered as candidate biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy after adjusting by urine creatinine.","Huang, XinyingZhang, HuiLiu, JihongYang, XuejiaoLiu, Zijie","Huang XZhang HAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8770-7348Liu JYang XLiu Z","Department of Clinical Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China.Yunnan Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Kunming, China.Yunnan Innovation Team of Clinical Laboratory and Diagnosis, First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China.Yunnan Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Kunming, China.Yunnan Innovation Team of Clinical Laboratory and Diagnosis, First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, the Third People's Hospital of Kunming, Kunming, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, the People's Hospital of ChuXiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, ChuXiong, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China.Yunnan Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Kunming, China.Yunnan Innovation Team of Clinical Laboratory and Diagnosis, First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China.","eng","201901C070035/the Joint Program of Yunnan Provincial Scienceand Technology Department and Kunming Medical University/40121066/the National Science Foundation of China/","Journal Article","20240201","United States","J Clin Lab Anal","Journal of clinical laboratory analysis","8801384","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Humans*Diabetic Nephropathies/urine*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/diagnosis/urineProteomicsBiomarkers/urinePrognosisKidney","PMC10873681",NA,"NOTNLM","biomarkernephropathyproteomicsurinary","The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.","2024/02/01 12:42","2024/02/19 06:42","2024/02/01","2024/02/01 08:55","2023/11/25 00:00 [revised]2023/08/04 00:00 [received]2023/12/24 00:00 [accepted]2024/02/19 06:42 [medline]2024/02/01 12:42 [pubmed]2024/02/01 08:55 [entrez]2024/02/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","JCLA25000 [pii]10.1002/jcla.25000 [doi]","ppublish","J Clin Lab Anal. 2024 Feb;38(3):e25000. doi: 10.1002/jcla.25000.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying vascular dysfunctions in diabetes include reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide, increased ROS and prothrombotic factors production, as well as activation of receptors for advanced glycation end-products. These alterations contribute to create a pro-inflammatory/thrombotic state that ultimately leads to plaque formation and complication. This study aimed at identifying differentially expressed plasma proteins between T2DM and non-diabetic patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, by means of two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with LC-MS/MS. Before analysis, plasma samples were enriched in low-expression proteins through combinatorial hexapeptide ligand libraries. Both mono and two-dimensional western blotting were performed for data validation. Differentially expressed proteins were mapped onto STRING v10 to build a protein-protein interaction network. Sixteen differentially expressed spots were identified with a high score. Among them, there were fibrinogen beta and gamma chains, complement C1r, C3 and C4-B subcomponents, alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), vitronectin and CD5 antigen-like. Protein-Protein interaction analysis evidenced a network among differentially expressed proteins in which vitronectin seems to represent a potentially pivotal node among fibrinolysis, complement dependent immune responses and inflammation in accordance with a number of in vitro and in vivo evidences for a contributory role of these proteins to the development of diabetic atherosclerosis.","Lepedda, Antonio JuniorLobina, OmarRocchiccioli, SilviaNieddu, GabrieleUcciferri, NadiaDe Muro, PierinaIdini, MichelaNguyen, Hai Quy TramGuarino, AnnaSpirito, RitaFormato, Marilena","Lepedda AJLobina ORocchiccioli SNieddu GUcciferri NDe Muro PIdini MNguyen HQGuarino ASpirito RFormato M","Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.

Urine from 60 T2DM patients was collected: 22 normal (stage A1), 18 moderately increased (stage A2) and 20 severely increased (stage A3) albuminuria. A total of 1080 naturally occurring peptides were detected, which resulted in the identification of a total of 100 proteins, irrespective of the patients' renal status. The classification accuracy showed that the most severe DKD (A3) presented a distinct urinary peptidomic pattern. Estimates for peptide importance assessed during RF model training included multiple fragments of collagen and alpha-1 antitrypsin, previously associated to DKD. Proteasix tool predicted 48 proteases potentially involved in the generation of the 60 most important peptides identified in the urine of DM patients, including metallopeptidases, cathepsins, and calpains.

Identifying risk factors associated with DR development and progression is crucial for improving treatment efficacy. Although proteomic changes in DR have been extensively studied, the results remain equivocal. Hence, this study aims to summarize and identify potential diagnostic or prognostic markers for DR. In addition, the upstream regulator responsible for protein deregulation of this disease was also validated. METHODS: We systematically analyzed the current literature on proteomic profile changes in DR, followed by pathway analysis identification. To validate the protein level changes, ELISA was performed from serum samples collected from 27 patients with DR and 25 healthy controls. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed that 1 candidate marker (afamin [AFM]) distinguished non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) from type 2 diabetic patients with no diabetic retinopathy/controls, 65 candidate markers distinguished proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) from NPDR, 1 candidate marker (thyroid receptor-interacting protein 11 [TRIP11]) distinguished PDR from PDR-DME/DME, and 3 candidate markers for therapeutic evaluation of PDR. Our results pinpoint that inflammatory response, which IL-6 mainly modulated, is responsible for the changes of proteomic profiles identified in DR.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Among 949 community-based participants aged ≥40 years without diabetes at baseline, fasting serum fructose levels were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The participants were followed up for the occurrence of diabetes. Cox regression models were performed to analyze the effect of fasting serum fructose levels on risk of incident diabetes. RESULTS: During a median of 3.5 years' follow-up, 179 of 949 (18.9%) participants developed type 2 diabetes. Elevated fasting serum fructose levels were associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes in a dose-response manner. After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, lipid profiles, blood pressure, liver function, smoking and drinking status, baseline glucose level, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, a 1-SD increased fasting fructose level was associated with a 35% (95% CI 1.08-1.67) increased risk of developing diabetes. After further adjustment for serum uric acid and estimated glomerular filtration rate, the association was partially attenuated (hazard ratio 1.33 [95% CI 1.07-1.65]). The association was similar by age, prediabetes status, BMI, and family history of diabetes but attenuated in women (P for heterogeneity = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated fasting serum fructose levels were independently associated with increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes in a middle-aged and older Chinese population. Our data suggest that higher fasting serum fructose levels might serve as a biomarker and/or a contributor to incident diabetes.","Chen, YingLin, HuandongQin, LiLu, YouliZhao, LinXia, MingfengJiang, JingjingLi, XiaomuYu, ChenZong, GengZheng, YanGao, XinSu, QingLi, Xiaoying","Chen YLin HQin LLu YZhao LXia MJiang JLi XYu CZong GZheng YGao XSu QAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-7945-1258Li XAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9383-5757","Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China li.xiaoying@zs-hospital.sh.cn suqingxinhua@163.com.Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital/Zhongshan-Xuhui Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.Shanghai Clinical Center, Chinese Academy of Science, Shanghai, China.Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China li.xiaoying@zs-hospital.sh.cn suqingxinhua@163.com.Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China li.xiaoying@zs-hospital.sh.cn suqingxinhua@163.com.Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital/Zhongshan-Xuhui Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.Shanghai Clinical Center, Chinese Academy of Science, Shanghai, China.CAS Key Laboratory of Nutrition, Metabolism and Food Safety, Institute of Nutrition and Health, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences and Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China li.xiaoying@zs-hospital.sh.cn suqingxinhua@163.com.Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China li.xiaoying@zs-hospital.sh.cn suqingxinhua@163.com.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20200701","United States","Diabetes Care","Diabetes care","7805975","0 (Biomarkers)30237-26-4 (Fructose)","IM","AdolescentAdultAgedAging/*bloodBiomarkers/bloodChina/epidemiologyCohort StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*epidemiology/etiologyFasting/*bloodFemaleFollow-Up StudiesFructose/*bloodHumansMaleMiddle AgedPrediabetic State/blood/epidemiologyProspective StudiesRisk FactorsYoung Adult",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2020/07/03 06:00","2021/05/04 06:00",NA,"2020/07/03 06:00","2019/12/11 00:00 [received]2020/05/24 00:00 [accepted]2020/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]2020/07/03 06:00 [entrez]","dc19-2494 [pii]10.2337/dc19-2494 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes Care. 2020 Sep;43(9):2217-2225. doi: 10.2337/dc19-2494.

However, little is known about the relationship between HUA and these diseases on the protein level. We performed label-free liquid chromatography MS/MS spectrometry analysis of urine samples from 26 HUA patients and 25 healthy controls, attempting to establish the possible protein links between HUA and these diseases by profiling urine proteome. A total of 2119 proteins were characterized in sample proteomes. Among them, 11 were found decreased and 2 were found increased in HUA samples. Plausible pathways found by enrichment analysis of these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) include the processes for insulin receptor recycling and lipid metabolism, suggesting potential links between HUA and T2DM and hyperlipidemia. The abundance changes of three key proteins (VATB1, CFAD, and APOC3) involved in these processes were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In conclusion, our result provides proteomic evidence, for the first time, that the aberrant pathways enriched by described key DEPs are closely related to the incidence of HUA and its concomitant diseases.","Huo, ShuaiWang, HongxinYan, MeixiaXu, PengSong, TingtingLi, ChuangTian, RuiminChen, XiaolingBao, KunXie, YingXu, PingZhu, WeiminLiu, FengsongMao, WeiShao, Chen","Huo SWang HYan MXu PSong

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dl-PHPB on memory deficits and preliminarily explore the underlying molecular mechanism. METHODS: Blood glucose and behavioral performance were evaluated in the KK-A(y) diabetic mouse model before and after dl-PHPB administration. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)-based proteomics was used to identify differentially expressed proteins in brain tissue. Western blotting was used to study the molecular mechanism of the related signaling pathways. RESULTS: Three-month-old KK-A(y) mice were given 150 mg/kg dl-PHPB by oral gavage for 2 months, which produced no effect on the level of serum glucose. In the Morris water maze test, KK-A(y) mice treated with dl-PHPB showed significant improvements in spatial learning and memory deficits compared with vehicle-treated KK-A(y) mice. Additionally, we performed 2D-DIGE to compare brain proteomes of 5-month KK-A(y) mice treated with and without dl-PHPB. We found 14 altered proteins in the cortex and 11 in the hippocampus; two of the 25 altered proteins and another four proteins that were identified in a previous study on KK-A(y) mice were then validated by western blot to further confirm whether dl-PHPB can reverse the expression levels of these proteins. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β) signaling pathway was also changed in KK-A(y) mice and dl-PHPB treatment could reverse it. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that dl-PHPB may play a potential role in diabetes-associated cognitive impairment through PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway and the differentially expressed proteins may become putative therapeutic targets.","Yu, WenwenYin, HuajingSun, YingniShi, SiLi, JiangWang, Xiaoliang","Yu WYin HSun YAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6078-8835Shi SLi JWang XAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-0114-3906","State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Department of Pharmacology, Institute of materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Department of Pharmacology, Institute of materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Department of Pharmacology, Institute of materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Department of Pharmacology, Institute of materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Department of Pharmacology, Institute of materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Department of Pharmacology, Institute of materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20220420","England","CNS Neurosci Ther","CNS neuroscience & therapeutics","101473265","0 (2-(1-hydroxypentyl)-benzoate)0 (Benzoates)0 (Pentanes)EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)RWP5GA015D (Potassium)","IM","AnimalsBenzoatesBrain/metabolism*Cognitive Dysfunction/drug therapy/etiology*Diabetes MellitusDisease Models, AnimalGlycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/metabolismMemory Disorders/metabolismMicePentanesPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolismPotassiumProteomicsProto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism","PMC9160457",NA,"NOTNLM","2D-DIGEAlzheimer's diseasediabetic encephalopathydl-PHPBproteomicstype 2 diabetes mellitus","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","2022/04/22 06:00","2022/06/07 06:00","2022/04/20","2022/04/21 05:49","2021/09/16 00:00 [revised]2021/05/19 00:00 [received]2021/09/23 00:00 [accepted]2022/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]2022/06/07 06:00 [medline]2022/04/21 05:49 [entrez]2022/04/20 00:00 [pmc-release]","CNS13847 [pii]10.1111/cns.13847 [doi]","ppublish","CNS Neurosci Ther. 2022 Jul;28(7):1108-1123. doi: 10.1111/cns.13847.

The objective of this study was to assess the validity of our experimental procedures for measuring AGEs in stored blood sample and to conduct a pilot study for developing AGE biomarkers for diabetes and/or age-related changes of glucose metabolism. We conducted a reliability study of the samples and methods using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS assays for 10 AGEs (including methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone (MG-H1), glucosepane (GSP) and two oxidation measures, in stored repository blood samples from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We also analyzed data relating blood GSP levels to type 2 diabetes status in a case-control study (25 cases and 15 controls). Among the AGEs, GSP, and MG-H1 showed the highest reliability across the various measures: reliability in duplicate samples and stability with delayed processing and storage over 1-2 year period. Furthermore, plasma GSP was associated with older age (P = 0.04) and type 2 diabetes status (age-adjusted P = 0.0475). Our findings suggest that analysis of these AGEs may be developed as biomarkers for diabetes and/or age-related changes of glucose metabolism. © 2018 BioFactors, 44(3):281-288, 2018.","Chiu, Chung-JungRabbani, NailaRowan, SheldonChang, Min-LeeSawyer, SherilynHu, Frank BWillett, WalterThornalley, Paul JAnwar, AttiaBar, LilianaKang, Jae HTaylor, Allen","Chiu CJAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2936-9181Rabbani NRowan SChang MLSawyer SHu FBWillett WThornalley PJAnwar ABar LKang JHAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4812-0557Taylor A","Jean Mayer United States Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, MA, USA.Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Clinical Sciences Research Laboratories, University Hospital, Coventry, UK.Zeeman Institute of Systems Biology, University of Warwick, Clinical Sciences Research Laboratories, University Hospital, Coventry, UK.Proteomics Research Technology Plateform, School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick, Gibbet Hill, Coventry, UK.Jean Mayer United States Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, MA, USA.Jean Mayer United States Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, MA, USA.Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Clinical Sciences Research Laboratories, University Hospital, Coventry, UK.Zeeman Institute of Systems Biology, University of Warwick, Clinical Sciences Research Laboratories, University Hospital, Coventry, UK.Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Clinical Sciences Research Laboratories, University Hospital, Coventry, UK.Zeeman Institute of Systems Biology, University of Warwick, Clinical Sciences Research Laboratories, University Hospital, Coventry, UK.Kamada, Rehovot, Israel.Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.Jean Mayer United States Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, MA, USA.","eng","R01 EY013250/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 EY026979/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 EY021826/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United StatesUM1 CA186107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesUM1 CA167552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 CA049449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 EY021212/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United StatesP30 DK046200/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR01 EY028559/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States","Journal Article","20180502","Netherlands","Biofactors","BioFactors (Oxford, England)","8807441","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Glycation End Products, Advanced)0 (Imidazoles)0 (Ndelta-(5-hydro-5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)ornithine)66K23JT22H (glucosepane)E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)","IM","Age FactorsAging/*bloodBiomarkers/bloodBlood BanksBlood Glucose/metabolismCase-Control StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/diagnosisFemaleFollow-Up StudiesGlycation End Products, Advanced/*bloodHumansImidazoles/*bloodMiddle AgedOrnithine/*analogs & derivatives/bloodOxidation-ReductionPilot Projects","PMC8527553","NIHMS1644897","NOTNLM","advanced glycation end productsbiomarkersdiabetesglycemic indexhyperglycemia",NA,"2018/05/03 06:00","2018/10/13 06:00","2021/10/20","2018/05/03 06:00","2018/03/06 00:00 [received]2018/03/07 00:00 [accepted]2018/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]2018/10/13 06:00 [medline]2018/05/03 06:00 [entrez]2021/10/20 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1002/biof.1423 [doi]","ppublish","Biofactors. 2018 May;44(3):281-288. doi: 10.1002/biof.1423.

METHODOLOGY: The sample consisted of 18 patients with asymptomatic AP divided into two groups according to the presence of T2DM: diabetic group-patients with T2DM (n = 9) and control group-systemically healthy patients (n = 9). After sample collection, the root canal samples were prepared for proteomic analysis using reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis was performed by Protein Lynx Global Service software. Differences in protein expression between groups were calculated using t-test (p < .05). Biological functions were analysed using the Homo sapiens UniProt database. RESULTS: A total of 727 human proteins were identified in all samples. Among them, 124 proteins common to both groups were quantified, out of which 65 proteins from the diabetic group showed significant differences compared with the control: 43 upregulated (p < .05) and 22 downregulated (p < .05) proteins. No significant differences in protein expression were seen for the remaining 59 proteins (p > .05). Most proteins with differences in expression were related to immune/inflammatory response. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, Plastin-2, Lactotransferrin and 13 isoforms of immunoglobulins were upregulated. In contrast, Protein S100-A8, Protein S100-A9, Histone H2B, Neutrophil defensin 1, Neutrophil defensin 3 and Prolactin-inducible protein were downregulated. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative differences were demonstrated in the expression of proteins common to diabetic and control groups, mainly related to immune response, oxidative stress, apoptosis and proteolysis. These findings revealed biological pathways that provide the basis to support clinical findings on the relationship between AP and T2DM.","Loureiro, CarolineBuzalaf, Marília Afonso RabeloPessan, Juliano PelimVentura, Talita Mendes OliveiraPelá, Vinícius TaioquiRibeiro, Ana Paula FernandesJacinto, Rogério de Castilho","Loureiro CAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9035-2960Buzalaf MARAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5985-3951Pessan JPAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1550-3933Ventura TMOAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2101-1350Pelá VTAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-7933-4422Ribeiro APFAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5313-5003Jacinto RCAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2362-8920","Department of Preventive and Restorative Dentistry, School of Dentistry, Araçatuba, São Paulo State University, Araçatuba, Brazil.Department of Biological Sciences, Bauru School of Dentistry, University of São Paulo, Bauru, Brazil.Department of Preventive and Restorative Dentistry, School of Dentistry, Araçatuba, São Paulo State University, Araçatuba, Brazil.Department of Biological Sciences, Bauru School of Dentistry, University of São Paulo, Bauru, Brazil.Department of Genetics and Evolution, Federal University of Sao Carlos, São Carlos, Brazil.Department of Preventive and Restorative Dentistry, School of Dentistry, Araçatuba, São Paulo State University, Araçatuba, Brazil.Department of Preventive and Restorative Dentistry, School of Dentistry, Araçatuba, São Paulo State University, Araçatuba, Brazil.","eng","001/Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior/2018/18741-0/Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo/2019/14995-0/Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo/","Journal Article","20220714","England","Int Endod J","International endodontic journal","8004996","0 (Defensins)",NA,"Cross-Sectional StudiesDefensinsDental Pulp Cavity*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complicationsHumans*Periapical PeriodontitisProteomics",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","apical periodontitisdiabetes mellitusendodonticshost-pathogen interactionsproteomics",NA,"2022/06/30 06:00","2022/08/16 06:00",NA,"2022/06/29 11:02","2022/06/21 00:00 [revised]2021/11/08 00:00 [received]2022/06/22 00:00 [accepted]2022/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]2022/08/16 06:00 [medline]2022/06/29 11:02 [entrez]","10.1111/iej.13794 [doi]","ppublish","Int Endod J. 2022 Sep;55(9):910-922. doi: 10.1111/iej.13794.

Metformin has been used as the first line of therapy in T2DM as it decreases hepatic glucose production and glucose intestinal absorption, enhances insulin sensitivity and weight loss, and is known to ameliorate inflammation. The mechanisms through which metformin exerts its effect remain unclear. Proteomics has emerged as a unique approach to explore the biological changes associated with diseases, including T2DM. It provides insight into the circulating biomarkers/mediators which could be utilized for disease screening, diagnosis, and prognosis. Methods: This study evaluated the proteomic changes in obese (Ob), obese diabetics (OD), and obese diabetic patients on metformin (ODM) using a 2D DIGE MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric approach. Results: Significant changes in sixteen plasma proteins (15 up and 1 down, ANOVA, p ≤ 0.05; fold change ≥ 1.5) were observed in the ODM group when compared to the Ob and OD groups. Bioinformatic network pathway analysis revealed that the majority of these altered plasma proteins are involved in distinct pathways involving acute-phase response, inflammation, and oxidative response and were centered around HNF4A, ERK, JNK, and insulin signaling pathways. Conclusions: Our study provides important information about the possible biomarkers altered by metformin treatment in obese patients with and without T2DM. These altered plasma proteins are involved in distinct pathways involving acute-phase response, inflammation, and oxidative response and were centered around HNF4A, ERK, JNK, and insulin signaling pathways. The presented proteomic profiling approach may help in identifying potential biomarkers/mediators affected by metformin treatment in T2DM and inform the understanding of metformin's mechanisms of action.","Alshahrani, AwadAljada, AhmadMasood, AfshanMujammami, MuhammadAlfadda, Assim AMusambil, MohthashAlanazi, Ibrahim OAl Dubayee, MohammedAbdel Rahman, Anas MBenabdelkamel, Hicham","Alshahrani AAljada AMasood AMujammami MAlfadda AAAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4792-5188Musambil MAlanazi IOAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8479-7875Al Dubayee MAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-7869-926XAbdel Rahman AMAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9527-9424Benabdelkamel H","Department of Medicine, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh 11426, Saudi Arabia.King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh 11481, Saudi Arabia.Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, Al Faisal University, Riyadh 11533, Saudi Arabia.Proteomics Resource Unit, Obesity Research Center, College of Medicine, King Saud University, P.O.

Insulin resistance affects especially one of the main target organs of this hormone, the skeletal musculature, making impaired glucose metabolism in contractile fibres a major feature of type 2 diabetes. High levels of circulating free fatty acids, an increased intramyocellular lipid content, impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake, diminished mitochondrial functioning and an overall weakened metabolic flexibility are pathobiochemical hallmarks of diabetic skeletal muscles. In order to increase our cellular understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie this complex diabetes-associated skeletal muscle pathology, we initiated herein a mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of skeletal muscle preparations from the non-obese Goto-Kakizaki rat model of type 2 diabetes. Following staining of high-resolution two-dimensional gels with colloidal Coomassie Blue, 929 protein spots were detected, whereby 21 proteins showed a moderate differential expression pattern. Decreased proteins included carbonic anhydrase, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase and enolase. Increased proteins were identified as monoglyceride lipase, adenylate kinase, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, phosphoglucomutase, aldolase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase, small heat shock Hsp27/B1, actin and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. These proteomic findings suggest that the diabetic phenotype is associated with a generally perturbed protein expression pattern, affecting especially glucose, fatty acid, nucleotide and amino acid metabolism, as well as the contractile apparatus, the cellular stress response, the anti-oxidant defense system and detoxification mechanisms. The altered expression levels of distinct skeletal muscle proteins, as documented in this study, might be helpful for the future establishment of a comprehensive biomarker signature of type 2 diabetes. Reliable markers could be used for improving diagnostics, monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic evaluations.","Mullen, EdelOhlendieck, Kay","Mullen EOhlendieck K","Department of Biology, National University of Ireland, Maynooth, County Kildare, Ireland.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"Greece","Int J Mol Med","International journal of molecular medicine","9810955","0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Muscle Proteins)0 (Proteome)","IM","Amino Acid SequenceAnimalsBlood Glucose/metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*metabolismDisease Models, AnimalElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-DimensionalHumansMass SpectrometryMolecular Sequence DataMuscle Proteins/*chemistry/metabolismMuscle, Skeletal/*chemistry/metabolismObesity/*metabolismProteome/*analysisRatsRats, Inbred StrainsRats, Wistar",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2010/02/04 06:00","2010/04/13 06:00",NA,"2010/02/04 06:00","2010/02/04 06:00 [entrez]2010/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]2010/04/13 06:00 [medline]","10.3892/ijmm_00000364 [doi]","ppublish","Int J Mol Med. 2010 Mar;25(3):445-58. doi: 10.3892/ijmm_00000364.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2010

METHODS: Thirty-two subjects were divided into four groups: one group of eight type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients without apparent DR (No-DR, NDR), one group of eight T2DM patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), one group of eight T2DM patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and one group of eight healthy volunteer participants. Two dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) was applied to establish differential protein expression profiles in four groups. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS) was applied to identify mass spectrometry of differential proteins and analyze follow-up bioinformatics. RESULTS: 2D-DIGE maps of serum protein were satisfactory obtained from NDR, NPDR, PDR and normal control groups. Twenty-six different proteins spots were screened (the volume ratio was >1.5 based on DeCyder software analysis). Twenty-four of them were verified and two of them were not. Fifteen proteins were verified. Most of them were high-abundant proteins in serum. The four relatively low-abundant ones were beta 2-glycoprotein I (β(2)-GPI), alpha2-HS-glycoprotein(AHSG), alpha1-acid glycoprotein(α(1)-AGP) and apolipoprotein A-1(apo A-1). β(2)-GPI expression was gradually increased in the development of DR but unrelated to the severity of DR. The volume ratio of β(2)-GPI is 1.54, 2.43, and 2.84 in NDR, NPDR and PDR group respectively compared with normal control group. CONCLUSION: Serum proteomic analysis of 2D-DIGE combined with MALDI-TOF-TOF MS is feasible to be applied in the study of DR. β(2)-GPI probably takes part in the process of DR occurrence and development and it could be a candidate biomarker on DR diagnosis in early phase.","Liu, Yin-PingHu, Shui-WangWu, Zhen-FengMei, Li-XinLang, PingLu, Xiao-He","Liu YPHu SWWu ZFMei LXLang PLu XH","Department of Ophthalmology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510282, Guangdong Province, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20111218","China","Int J Ophthalmol","International journal of ophthalmology","101553860",NA,NA,NA,"PMC3340797",NA,"NOTNLM","diabetic retinopathydifference gel electrophoresisproteomicsserumtype 2 diabetesβ2-glycoprotein I",NA,"2011/01/01 00:00","2011/01/01 00:01","2011/12/18","2012/05/04 06:00","2011/10/12 00:00 [received]2011/11/21 00:00 [accepted]2012/05/04 06:00 [entrez]2011/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]2011/01/01 00:01 [medline]2011/12/18 00:00 [pmc-release]","ijo-04-06-616 [pii]10.3980/j.issn.2222-3959.2011.06.08 [doi]","ppublish","Int J Ophthalmol. 2011;4(6):616-22. doi: 10.3980/j.issn.2222-3959.2011.06.08.

We adopted a proteomics-based approach using 2D-DIGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS to compare the differential plasma proteome between diabetic retinopathy with significant retinopathy occurrence within 5years after diagnosis of diabetes, and diabetic non-retinopathy without diagnosed retinopathy for more than 10years after diagnosis of diabetes. We identified 77 plasma proteins, which represent 28 unique gene products. These proteins mainly have inflammatory response and coagulation roles. Our approach identified several potential diabetic retinopathy biomarkers including afamin and the protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5, which may be associated with the progression and development of diabetes. In conclusion, we report a comprehensive patient-based plasma proteomic approach to the identification of potential plasma biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy screening and detection.","Lu, Chieh-HsiangLin, Szu-TingChou, Hsiu-ChuanLee, Ying-RayChan, Hong-Lin","Lu CHLin STChou HCLee YRChan HL","Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Chiayi Christian Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20121204","United States","Arch Biochem Biophys","Archives of biochemistry and biophysics","0372430","0 (AFM protein, human)0 (Biomarkers)0 (Carrier Proteins)0 (Glycoproteins)0 (Proteome)0 (Serum Albumin)EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)ZIF514RVZR (Serum Albumin, Human)","IM","Biomarkers/bloodCarrier Proteins/*bloodDiabetic Retinopathy/*blood/*diagnosisFemaleGlycoproteins/*bloodHumansMaleMiddle AgedProtein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/*bloodProteome/analysis/*metabolismReproducibility of ResultsSensitivity and SpecificitySerum AlbuminSerum Albumin, Human",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2012/12/12 06:00","2013/03/21 06:00",NA,"2012/12/11 06:00","2012/09/21 00:00 [received]2012/10/14 00:00 [revised]2012/11/09 00:00 [accepted]2012/12/11 06:00 [entrez]2012/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]2013/03/21 06:00 [medline]","S0003-9861(12)00387-6 [pii]10.1016/j.abb.2012.11.004 [doi]","ppublish","Arch Biochem Biophys. 2013 Jan 15;529(2):146-56. doi: 10.1016/j.abb.2012.11.004.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) MGD shows a notable disturbance in lipid metabolism. Er-Dong-Xiao-Ke decoction (EDXKD) has important functions in nourishing yin, clearing heat, and removing blood stasis, which are effective in the treatment of DM MGD. AIM OF THE STUDY: To observe the therapeutic effect of EDXKD on DM MGD and its underlying molecular mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After establishing a type 2 DM (T2DM)-induced MGD rat model, different doses of EDXKD and T0070907 were administered. The chemical constituents of EDXKD were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the molecular mechanism of EDXKD in treating DM MGD was predicted using network pharmacology. Lipid metabolism in DM meibomian glands (MGs) was analyzed using LC-MS/MS, and lipid biomarkers were screened and identified. Histological changes and lipid accumulation in MGs were detected by staining, and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) expression in MG acinar cells was detected by immunofluorescence. The expression of lipid metabolism-related factors was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) or western blotting. RESULTS: EDXKD reduced lipid accumulation in the MGs and improved the ocular surface index in DM MGD rats. The main active components of EDXKD had advantages in lipid regulation. Additionally, the PPARG signaling pathway was the key pathway of EDXKD in the treatment of DM MGD. Twelve lipid metabolites were biomarkers of EDXKD in the treatment of DM MGD, and glycerophospholipid metabolism was the main pathway of lipid regulation. Moreover, EDXKD improved lipid deposition in the acini and upregulated the expression of PPARG. Further, EDXKD regulated the PPARG-mediated UCP2/AMPK signaling network, inhibited lipid production, and promoted lipid transport. CONCLUSION: EDXKD is an effective treatment for MGD in patients with T2DM. EDXKD can regulate lipids by regulating the PPARG-mediated UCP2/AMPK signaling network, as it reduced lipid accumulation in the MGs of DM MGD rats, promoted lipid metabolism, and improved MG function and ocular surface indices.","Shi, LiLi, Liu-JiaoSun, Xin-YiChen, Yi-YingLuo, DanHe, Lu-PingJi, Hui-JieGao, Wei-PingShen, Hu-Xing","Shi LLi LJSun XYChen YYLuo DHe LPJi HJGao WPShen HX","Department of Ophthalmology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.Department of Ophthalmology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.Department of Endocrinology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.Department of Acupuncture Rehabilitation, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.Department of Ophthalmology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.Department of Ophthalmology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.Department of Ophthalmology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.Department of Ophthalmology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PR China.

We found 325 proteins associated with incident diabetes after adjusting for age, sex, and sample batch (false discovery rate q < 0.05) measured using a single-stranded DNA aptamer affinity-based method on fasting plasma samples. A subset was independent of established markers of diabetes development pathways, such as adiposity, glycemia, and/or insulin resistance, suggesting potential novel biological processes associated with disease development. Thirty-six associations remained significant after additional adjustments for BMI, fasting plasma glucose, cholesterol levels, hypertension, statin use, and renal function. Twelve associations, including the top associations of complement factor H, formimidoyltransferase cyclodeaminase, serine/threonine-protein kinase 17B, and high-mobility group protein B1, were replicated in a meta-analysis of two self-identified White cohorts-the Framingham Heart Study and the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study-supporting the generalizability of these biomarkers. A selection of these diabetes-associated proteins also improved risk prediction. Thus, we uncovered both novel and broadly generalizable associations by studying a diverse population, providing a more complete understanding of the diabetes-associated proteome.","Chen, Zsu-ZsuGao, YanKeyes, Michelle JDeng, ShuliangMi, MichaelFarrell, Laurie AShen, DongxiaoTahir, Usman ACruz, Daniel ENgo, DebbyBenson, Mark DRobbins, Jeremy MCorrea, AdolfoWilson, James GGerszten, Robert E","Chen ZZGao YKeyes MJDeng SMi MFarrell LAShen DTahir UACruz DENgo DBenson MDRobbins JMCorrea AWilson JGGerszten REAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6767-7687","Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Harvard School of Medicine, Boston, MA.Jackson Heart Study, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Harvard School of Medicine, Boston, MA.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Harvard School of Medicine, Boston, MA.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Harvard School of Medicine, Boston, MA.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Harvard School of Medicine, Boston, MA.Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Harvard School of Medicine, Boston, MA.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Harvard School of Medicine, Boston, MA.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Jackson Heart Study, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Harvard School of Medicine, Boston, MA.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Boston, MA.","eng","HHSN268201800012C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesHHSN268201800014I/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesK08 HL161445/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesHHSN268201800014C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesRF1 AG063507/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesHHSN268201800013I/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United StatesHHSN268201800012I/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL133870/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesHHSN268201800015I/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesK23 DK127073/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesK08 HL145095/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL132320/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesHHSN268201800011C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesK23 HL150327/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesHHSN268201800010I/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesHHSN268201800011I/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesHHSN268201600034I/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleMeta-AnalysisResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"United States","Diabetes","Diabetes","0372763","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Humans*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolismBlack or African AmericanRisk FactorsObesityBiomarkers","PMC10033249",NA,NA,NA,"Duality of Interest.

This indicates a central role of mesangial cells in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy. Using the proteomic approach, it was earlier elucidated in a rat model that the proteasome subunit-α type-6 protein (PSMA6) is suppressed in the renal cortex in nephropathic kidney. However, the underlying mechanism effecting suppression of PSMA6 protein in the renal cortex is not yet known. Twenty diabetic patients were enrolled and the expression level of PSMA6 in them was detected by immunohistochemistry. The protein and mRNA expression levels of PSMA6 in NRK-52E cells under high glucose condition were determined by Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. Dual luciferase assay was used to detect the relationship of PSMA6 and miR-4490. Our results show that PSMA6 protein is down-regulated in patients with diabetic nephropathy compared with healthy control. Using the NRK-52E cell line cultured under high glucose condition as an in vitro model of diabetic nephropathy, we show that loss of PSMA6 protein expression occured independent of changes the in PSMA6 mRNA expression. We next elucidate that PSMA6 mRNA is post-transcriptionally regulated by the microRNA (miRNA)-4490, whose expression is inversely correlated to PSMA6 protein expression. Using reporter assays we show that PSMA6 is a direct target of the miR-4490. Exogenous manipulation of miR-4490 levels modulated expression of PSMA6, indicating that miR-4490 can be tested as a biomarker for nephropathy in diabetic patients.","Feng, YingJin, Ming-yueLiu, Dong-weiWei, Li","Feng YJin MYLiu DWWei L","Department of Endocrinology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518107, China.Department of Endocrinology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518107, China.Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518107, China.Department of Dermatology, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing 100045, China liwei_bch@126.com.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20181031","England","Biosci Rep","Bioscience reports","8102797","0 (3' Untranslated Regions)0 (Antagomirs)0 (MIRN4490 microRNA, human)0 (MicroRNAs)0 (Oligoribonucleotides)EC 1.13.12.

The precise PANDER-induced hepatic signaling mechanism is still being elucidated and has been very complex due to the pleiotropic nature of this novel hormone. Our PANDER transgenic (PANTG) mouse displays a selective hepatic insulin resistant (SHIR) phenotype whereby insulin signaling is blunted yet lipogenesis is increased, a phenomena observed in type 2 diabetes. To examine the complex PANDER-induced mechanism of SHIR, we utilized quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis using Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC) to reveal the global hepatic proteome differences within the PANTG under the metabolic states of fasting, fed and insulin-stimulated conditions. Proteomic analysis identified lipid metabolism as one of the top cellular functions differentially altered in all metabolic states. Differentially expressed proteins within the PANTG having a lipid metabolic role included ACC, ACLY, CD36, CYP7A1, FASN and SCD1. Central to the differentially expressed proteins involved in lipid metabolism was the predicted activation of the liver X receptor (LXR) pathway. Western analysis validated the increased hepatic expression of LXRα along with LXR-directed targets such as FASN and CYP7A1 within the PANTG liver. Furthermore, recombinant PANDER was capable of inducing LXR promoter activity in-vitro as determined by luciferase reporter assays. Taken together, PANDER strongly impacts hepatic lipid metabolism across metabolic states and may induce a SHIR phenotype via the LXR pathway.","Athanason, Mark GRatliff, Whitney AChaput, DaleMarElia, Catherine BKuehl, Melanie NStevens, Stanley M JrBurkhardt, Brant R","Athanason MGRatliff WAChaput DMarElia CBKuehl MNStevens SM JrBurkhardt BR","Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, BSF 206, Tampa, FL 33620, USA.Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, BSF 206, Tampa, FL 33620, USA.Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, BSF 206, Tampa, FL 33620, USA.Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, BSF 206, Tampa, FL 33620, USA.Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, BSF 206, Tampa, FL 33620, USA.Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, BSF 206, Tampa, FL 33620, USA.Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, BSF 206, Tampa, FL 33620, USA.

There is mounting evidence that diabetes may play a role in the greater incidence of EC. The molecular mechanisms of the interaction between type 2 diabetes and EC are not yet clearly understood yet. The present study was undertaken to investigate the plasma proteomics of EC patients with diabetes in comparison to those of EC patients without diabetes. Plasma samples were obtained from age-matched patients (EC diabetic and EC nondiabetic). Untargeted proteomic analysis was carried out using a two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Of the 33 proteins identified, which significantly differed in the plasma abundance between groups, 17 were upregulated and 16 were downregulated. The majority of the altered proteins are involved in the acute phase reaction, cholesterol metabolism, scavenging of heme from plasma, and plasma lipoprotein assembly and mobilization. α-2-macroglobulin, Ras association domain-containing protein 3, apolipoprotein A-I, α-1B-glycoprotein, and zinc-α-2-glycoprotein were significantly upregulated. The significantly downregulated proteins included haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A-IV, hemopexin, and α-1-antichymotrypsin. The differential expression of proteins found in patients who had EC and diabetes indicated severe disease and a poor prognosis. The protein interaction analysis showed dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism and heme scavenging pathways in these patients.","Mujammami, MuhammadRafiullah, MohamedAkkour, KhalidAlfadda, Assim AMasood, AfshanJoy, Salini ScariaAlhalal, HaniArafah, MariaAlshehri, EmanAlanazi, Ibrahim OBenabdelkamel, Hicham","Mujammami MRafiullah MAkkour KAlfadda AAMasood AJoy SSAlhalal HArafah MAlshehri EAlanazi IOBenabdelkamel HAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9745-2959","University Diabetes Center, King Saud University Medical City, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Strategic Center for Diabetes Research, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, College of Medicine, King Saud University Medical City,King Saud University, Riyadh 12372, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Strategic Center for Diabetes Research, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Proteomics Resource Unit, Obesity Research Center, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Proteomics Resource Unit, Obesity Research Center, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Strategic Center for Diabetes Research, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, College of Medicine, King Saud University Medical City,King Saud University, Riyadh 12372, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, King Saud University Medical City, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, College of Medicine, King Saud University Medical City,King Saud University, Riyadh 12372, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Proteomics Resource Unit, Obesity Research Center, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.Healthy Aging Research Institute, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST), Riyadh 11442, Saudi Arabia.Proteomics Resource Unit, Obesity Research Center, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240118","United States","ACS Omega","ACS omega","101691658",NA,NA,NA,"PMC10831832",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare no competing financial interest.","2024/02/05 06:44","2024/02/05 06:45","2024/01/18","2024/02/05 04:44","2023/10/12 00:00 [received]2023/12/20 00:00 [revised]2024/01/04 00:00 [accepted]2024/02/05 06:45 [medline]2024/02/05 06:44 [pubmed]2024/02/05 04:44 [entrez]2024/01/18 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1021/acsomega.3c07992 [doi]","epublish","ACS Omega. 2024 Jan 18;9(4):4721-4732. doi: 10.1021/acsomega.3c07992. eCollection 2024 Jan 30.","© 2024 The Authors.

Here, we report the results from the study extended to the entire IRAS cohort. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective study included 138 incident type 2 diabetes case and 714 noncase subjects. Four F(2)-isoprostanes (iPF2α-III; 2,3-dinor-iPF2α-III; iPF2α-VI; and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI) were assayed in baseline urine samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Three F(2)-isoprostanes showed significant inverse associations with type 2 diabetes risk: the adjusted odds ratios were 0.52 (95% CI 0.39-0.67), 0.56 (0.42-0.73), 0.62 (0.48-0.79), and 0.91 (0.72-1.12) for iPF2α-III; 2,3-dinor-iPF2α-III; iPF2α-VI; and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI, respectively.

We aimed to identify proteomic biomarkers among T2DM patients with nephropathy or retinopathy. METHODS: Plasma low abundance proteins were enriched by depletion of 14 high abundance proteins using an affinity removal system, and subjected to nanoflow liquid chromatography electrospray ionization (nano LC-ESI) mass spectrometry after a gel electrophoresis with in-gel digestion. The plasma differential proteomes between normal adults and diabetic patients were validated by another cohort of 149 T2DM patients. RESULTS: A total of 826 proteins in plasma were consistently identified from 8 plasma samples of normal adults, and 817 proteins were consistently identified in 8 plasma samples of T2DM patients. Using the MetaCore analysis, low abundance proteins in plasma between normal adults and T2DM patients were significantly different in 5 functional pathways. Moreover, plasma prolactin-induced protein (PIP), thrombospondin-2 (THBS2), L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels were higher in T2DM patients. Further, PIP, THBS2 and NGAL were significantly higher in T2DM patients with nephropathy (albuminuria) but not in those with retinopathy, while L1CAM levels were higher in T2DM patients with retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that higher PIP, THBS2 and/or NGAL levels were significantly associated with nephropathy of T2DM, and higher L1CAM but normal PIP, THBS2 or NGAL was significantly associated with retinopathy of T2DM.","Yeh, Shu-HuiChang, Wan-ChingChuang, HauHuang, Hui-ChengLiu, Rue-TsuanYang, Kuender D","Yeh SHChang WCChuang HHuang HCLiu RTYang KD","Institute of Long-term Care, MacKay Medical College, Sanzhi District New Taipei City, 252 Taiwan.Department of Medical Research, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Kaohsiung Medical Center, Kaohsiung, 833 Taiwan.Proteomic Core Laboratory, Department of Medical Research, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, 833 Taiwan.Department of Medical Research, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung, 833 Taiwan.Division of Endocrinology & Metabolism, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Kaohsiung Medical Center and Chang Gung University, Kaohsiung, 833 Taiwan.Department of Research & Development, MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taipei 104, New Taipei City, 252 Taiwan ; Department of Medicine, MacKay Medical College, New Taipei City, 252 Taiwan.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20160720","Switzerland","J Diabetes Metab Disord","Journal of diabetes and metabolic disorders","101590741",NA,NA,NA,"PMC4955199",NA,"NOTNLM","AlbuminuriaLow abundance proteinsNephropathyPlasma proteomeRetinopathyType 2 diabetes",NA,"2015/01/01 00:00","2015/01/01 00:01","2016/07/20","2016/07/23 06:00","2016/04/21 00:00 [received]2016/07/12 00:00 [accepted]2016/07/23 06:00 [entrez]2015/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]2015/01/01 00:01 [medline]2016/07/20 00:00 [pmc-release]","246 [pii]10.1186/s40200-016-0246-6 [doi]","epublish","J Diabetes Metab Disord. 2016 Jul 20;15:24. doi: 10.1186/s40200-016-0246-6. eCollection 2015.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1186/s40200-016-0246-6",NA,2015

Oxysterols are associated with atherogenesis, neurodegeneration, and inflammation. We developed a GC-MS method for the simultaneous analysis of these species in human plasma, including 24-, 25-, 27-hydroxycholesterol; 7-ketocholesterol; lanosterol; lathosterol; 7-dehydrocholesterol; desmosterol; stigmasterol; sitosterol; and campesterol. METHODS: Sterols were hydrolyzed with ethanolic potassium hydroxide solution, extracted by liquid/liquid extraction with n-hexane, and derivatized with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoracetamide. Positive chemical ionization with ammonia, as reagent gas, was applied to generate high abundant precursor ions. RESULTS: The definition of highly sensitive precursor/product ion transitions, especially for coeluting substances, allowed fast gas chromatography run times of under 8.5 min. Using the multiple reaction monitoring mode, detection limits in the picogram per milliliter range could be achieved for most compounds. The method was validated for precision and recovery. Intraassay and interassay CVs were mostly <15% for serum and plasma samples. The recoveries of supplemented plasma samples in different concentrations were 88%-117%. The method was applied to stratification of patients with disorders in cholesterol biosynthesis and/or cholesterol absorption in hypercholesterolemia. The method revealed associations of sterol species with thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: This method allows high-throughput sterol profiling in various diseases.","Matysik, SKlünemann, H HSchmitz, G","Matysik SKlünemann HHSchmitz G","University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20120920","England","Clin Chem","Clinical chemistry","9421549","0 (Phytosterols)0 (Sterols)97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)","IM","Cholesterol/bloodGas Chromatography-Mass SpectrometryHumansHypercholesterolemia/bloodHyperthyroidism/bloodHypothyroidism/bloodNiemann-Pick Disease, Type C/geneticsPhytosterols/bloodPlasmaSterols/*bloodTandem Mass SpectrometryTangier Disease/geneticsXanthomatosis, Cerebrotendinous/genetics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2012/09/22 06:00","2012/12/22 06:00",NA,"2012/09/22 06:00","2012/09/22 06:00 [entrez]2012/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]2012/12/22 06:00 [medline]","clinchem.2012.189605 [pii]10.1373/clinchem.2012.189605 [doi]","ppublish","Clin Chem. 2012 Nov;58(11):1557-64. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2012.189605.

The main purpose of the work was to assess whether saliva protein composition can reflect dietary habits in older adults, and how type 2 diabetes impacted on the saliva-diet correlates. METHODS: 214 participants were selected from 2 European cohorts of community-dwelling older adults (3C-Bordeaux and Seniors-ENRICA-2), using a case-control design nested in each cohort. Cases were individuals with type 2 diabetes. Dietary information was obtained using the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS). Saliva was successfully obtained from 211 subjects, and its proteome analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The relative abundance of 246 saliva proteins was obtained across all participants. The salivary proteome differed depending on the intake level of some food groups (especially vegetables, fruits, sweet snacks and red meat), in a diabetic statusand cohort-specific manner. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis suggested that some biological processes were consistently affected by diet across cohorts, for example enhanced platelet degranulation in high consumers of sweet snacks. Minimal models were then fitted to predict dietary variables by sociodemographic, clinical and salivary proteome variables. For the food group «sweet snacks», selected salivary proteins contributed to the predictive model and improved its performance in the Seniors-ENRICA-2 cohort and when both cohorts were combined. CONCLUSION: Saliva proteome composition of elderly individuals can reflect some aspects of dietary patterns.","Chambon, ChristopheNeyraud, EricSayd, ThierryBros, PaulineDi Biagio, RomaneHyvrier, FrankFéart, CatherineAndré, PerrineRodriguez-Artalejo, FernandoLopez-Garcia, EstherGarcia-Esquinas, EstherGomez-Cabrero, DavidProctor, GordonMorzel, Martine","Chambon CAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-0357-9807Neyraud EAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-7060-1336Sayd TAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-1370-8959Bros PDi Biagio RHyvrier FAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3633-9885Féart CAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7959-1610André PRodriguez-Artalejo FAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9317-5755Lopez-Garcia EAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6202-4970Garcia-Esquinas EAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8688-5174Gomez-Cabrero DAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4186-3788Proctor GAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5684-841XMorzel MAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-3589-3641","INRAE, Plateforme d'Exploration du Métabolisme Composante Protéome PFEMcp, St-Genès-Champanelle, France.Centre des Sciences du Goût et de l'Alimentation, AgroSup Dijon, CNRS, INRAE, Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, Dijon, France.INRAE, Plateforme d'Exploration du Métabolisme Composante Protéome PFEMcp, St-Genès-Champanelle, France.INRAE, Plateforme d'Exploration du Métabolisme Composante Protéome PFEMcp, St-Genès-Champanelle, France.Centre des Sciences du Goût et de l'Alimentation, AgroSup Dijon, CNRS, INRAE, Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, Dijon, France.Centre des Sciences du Goût et de l'Alimentation, AgroSup Dijon, CNRS, INRAE, Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, Dijon, France.Université de Bordeaux, Inserm, BPH, Team LEHA, UMR 1219, Bordeaux, France.Université de Bordeaux, Inserm, BPH, Team LEHA, UMR 1219, Bordeaux, France.Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid and CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain.Cardiovascular and Nutritional Epidemiology Group, IdiPAZ (La Paz University Hospital-Universidad Autónoma de Madrid), Madrid, Spain.IMDEA-Food Institute, Madrid, Spain.Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid and CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain.Cardiovascular and Nutritional Epidemiology Group, IdiPAZ (La Paz University Hospital-Universidad Autónoma de Madrid), Madrid, Spain.IMDEA-Food Institute, Madrid, Spain.Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid and CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain.Cardiovascular and Nutritional Epidemiology Group, IdiPAZ (La Paz University Hospital-Universidad Autónoma de Madrid), Madrid, Spain.Centre for Host Microbiome Interactions, Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences, King's College, London, UK.Centre for Host Microbiome Interactions, Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences, King's College, London, UK.Centre des Sciences du Goût et de l'Alimentation, AgroSup Dijon, CNRS, INRAE, Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, Dijon, France. martine.morzel@inrae.fr.","eng","ANR-16-HDHL-0005-01/Agence Nationale de la Recherche/APCIN 2016-145/Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad/BB/R000891/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom","Journal Article","20210526","Germany","Eur J Nutr","European journal of nutrition","100888704","0 (Proteome)","IM","Aged*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology*Diet, MediterraneanFeeding BehaviorHumansProteomeSaliva",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","AgeingDiabetesGene Set Enrichment AnalysisProteomicsSalivary biomarkersUsual diet",NA,"2021/05/28 06:00","2021/11/10 06:00",NA,"2021/05/27 06:58","2020/12/14 00:00 [received]2021/05/11 00:00 [accepted]2021/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]2021/11/10 06:00 [medline]2021/05/27 06:58 [entrez]","10.1007/s00394-021-02584-2 [pii]10.1007/s00394-021-02584-2 [doi]","ppublish","Eur J Nutr. 2021 Dec;60(8):4331-4344. doi: 10.1007/s00394-021-02584-2.

METHODS: We performed mass spectrometry-based label-free quantitative analysis of vitreous proteome of PDR (n = 13) and idiopathic macular hole (IMH; control) subjects (n = 14). Nine samples of PDR and 10 samples of IMH were pooled as case and control, respectively, and compared. Four samples each of PDR and IMH were analyzed individually without pooling to validate the results of the pooled analysis. Comparative quantification was performed using Scaffold software which calculated the fold changes of differential expression. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using DAVID and STRING software. RESULTS: We identified 469 proteins in PDR and 517 proteins in IMH vitreous, with an overlap of 172 proteins. Also, 297 unique proteins were identified in PDR and 345 in IMH. In PDR vitreous, 37 proteins were upregulated (P < 0.05) and 19 proteins were downregulated compared to IMH. Protein distribution analysis clearly demonstrated a separation of protein expression in PDR and IMH. Significantly upregulated proteins included fibrinogen gamma chain, fibrinogen beta chain, and carbonic anhydrase 1 and downregulated proteins included alpha-1-antitrypsin, retinol-binding protein 3, neuroserpin, cystatin C, carboxypeptidase E and cathepsin-D. CONCLUSION: Diabetic retinopathy pathogenesis involves proteins which belong to inflammation, visual transduction, and extracellular matrix pathways. Validation-based experiments using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or western blotting are needed to establish cause and effect relationships of these proteins to the disease state, to develop them as biomarkers or drug molecules.","Sen, SagnikUdaya, PrithvirajJeya Maheshwari, JayapalKohli, PiyushParida, HaemoglobinKannan, Naresh BabuRamasamy, KimDharmalingam, Kuppamuthu","Sen SUdaya PJeya Maheshwari JKohli PParida HKannan NBRamasamy KDharmalingam K","Department of Retina and Vitreous Services, Aravind Eye Hospital; Department of Proteomics, Aravind Medical Research Foundation, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.Department of Retina and Vitreous Services, Aravind Eye Hospital; Department of Proteomics, Aravind Medical Research Foundation, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.Department of Proteomics, Aravind Medical Research Foundation, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.Department of Retina and Vitreous Services, Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.Department of Retina and Vitreous Services, Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.Department of Retina and Vitreous Services, Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.Department of Retina and Vitreous Services, Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.Department of Proteomics, Aravind Medical Research Foundation, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.","eng",NA,"Journal Article",NA,"India","Indian J Ophthalmol","Indian journal of ophthalmology","0405376","0 (Proteome)9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)","IM","Humans*Diabetic Retinopathy/diagnosis*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/metabolismProteome/analysis/metabolismProteomics/methodsVision, OcularInflammationExtracellular Matrix/chemistry/metabolismFibrinogenEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay","PMC10538831",NA,"NOTNLM","Biomarkernovelproliferative diabetic retinopathyproteomics","None","2023/08/02 13:09","2023/08/03 06:43","2023/08/01","2023/08/02 07:48","2023/08/03 06:43 [medline]2023/08/02 13:09 [pubmed]2023/08/02 07:48 [entrez]2023/08/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","IndianJOphthalmol_2023_71_8_3069_382651 [pii]IJO-71-3069 [pii]10.4103/IJO.IJO_276_23 [doi]","ppublish","Indian J Ophthalmol. 2023 Aug;71(8):3069-3079. doi: 10.4103/IJO.IJO_276_23.",NA,NA,NA,"10.4103/IJO.IJO_276_23",NA,2023

Metabolic disrupting chemicals with short half-lives, such as those of halogenated structure (trihalomethanes, THM) have been linked with hepatic insulin resistance phenomena in animal studies. However, human studies evaluating the role of THM exposure on liver pathogenesis and T2DM disease process are scarce. The objectives of this study were to: i) determine the association of urinary brominated THM (BrTHM) levels and T2DM disease status, and ii) investigate the association between urinary BrTHM levels and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations, often used as surrogate markers of NAFLD. A pilot case-control study was conducted in Nicosia, Cyprus (n=95). Cases were physician-diagnosed T2DM patients and controls were healthy individuals. Liver enzymes, leptin and TNF-α were measured in sera, while urinary THM levels were measured using tandem mass spectrometry. Diabetics had higher levels of serum leptin, body mass index and ALT than the controls. Among all study participants those with serum ALT levels above the median (17IU/L) had higher mean tribromomethane (TBM) concentrations compared to those with serum ALT below 17IU/L. A significant increase in the odds of having above the median serum ALT levels [OR 6.38, 95% CI: 1.11, 42.84 (p=0.044)] was observed for each unit increase in creatinine-unadjusted urinary TBM levels, along with BMI and past smoking, after adjusting for possible confounders, such as urinary creatinine, age, sex, and leptin; no other THM compound showed a significant association with serum ALT. Logistic regression models for T2DM using the urinary BrTHM as exposure variables did not reach the predetermined level of significance. The interplay between exposures to BrTHM and the initiation of key pathophysiological events relating to hepatic injury (ALT) and inflammation (leptin) was recognized via the use of selected biomarkers of effect. Our evidence that THM could act as hepatic toxins with a further initiation of diabetogenic effects call for additional studies to help us better understand the disease process of the two co-morbidities (NAFLD and T2DM).","Makris, Konstantinos CAndrianou, Xanthi DCharisiadis, PantelisBurch, James BSeth, Ratanesh KIoannou, AndronikiPicolos, MichaelChristophi, Costas AChatterjee, Saurabh","Makris KCAndrianou XDCharisiadis PBurch JBSeth RKIoannou APicolos MChristophi CAChatterjee S","Cyprus International Institute for Environmental and Public Health, Cyprus University of Technology, Limassol, Cyprus.

However, the response of the skeletal muscle to transitioning from obesity to diabetes remains poorly defined, despite that obesity is classified as a stage of pre-diabetes. We screened and selected spontaneously obese and diabetic rhesus monkeys and examined altered protein expression in skeletal muscle of healthy aging (CON), obesity aging (OB), and type 2 diabetes mellitus aging (T2D) rhesus monkeys using Tandem Mass Tags (TMT)-based quantitative proteomic analysis. In total, we identified 142 differentially expressed proteins. Muscle-nerve communication proteins were firstly suppressed at obese-stage. With the disintegration of skeletal muscle, mitochondrial complex I and other energy homeostasis relate proteins were significantly disordered at T2D stage. Indicating that aging related obesity suppressed muscle-nerve communication and contribute to T2D related functional deterioration of skeletal muscles in elderly rhesus monkeys. Some alterations of muscular functional regulator are detected in both obesity and T2D samples, suggesting some T2D related skeletal muscular hypofunctions are occurring at obesity or pre-obesity stage.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits induced by T2DM are not fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of T2DM on behavior, the proteome profile in the hippocampus, and the potential molecular pathways involved in the development of cognitive dysfunction in T2DM mice. We found that the diabetic mice exhibited cognitive impairment in the novel object location recognition test and the novel object recognition test. The proteomic analysis revealed that various molecular pathways were involved in this context. These included the upregulation of proteins in the protein synthesis and folding pathway (EIF5A, RSP24, and PPIB), endocytosis and cellular trafficking (VPS24, SNX12, and ARP2/3), cannabinoid receptor interacting (CRIP1), ubiquitination (SKP1), and oxidative stress response (NUDT3). Downregulated proteins were related to mitochondria function (ANT1), neuronal development (ELP1), protein glycosylation (RPN2), and endocytosis (VPS4). Our study shows that T2DM mice exhibit neurocognitive impairment, which is linked to the dysregulation of hippocampal proteins involved in various molecular pathways. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of T2DM-related cognitive impairment and may identify molecular targets for drug development to treat T2DM-associated cognitive impairment conditions.","Janthakhin, YoottanaJuntapremjit, SirikranHummel, KarinRazzazi-Fazeli, EbrahimKingtong, Sutin","Janthakhin YAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5675-3453Juntapremjit SAUID ORCID: 0009-0003-9501-4746Hummel KRazzazi-Fazeli EKingtong SAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-1464-5718","Department of Research and Applied Psychology, Faculty of Education, Burapha University, Chonburi, Thailand.Department of Learning Management, Faculty of Education, Burapha University, Chonburi, Thailand.VetCore Facility for Research, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.VetCore Facility for Research, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Burapha University, Chonburi, Thailand.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20241218","United States","Bioinform Biol Insights","Bioinformatics and biology insights","101467187",NA,NA,NA,"PMC11656429",NA,"NOTNLM","cognitive deficitdiabetes mellitushippocampusmouse modelproteomics","The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.","2024/12/20 06:23","2024/12/20 06:24","2024/12/18","2024/12/20 04:14","2024/04/06 00:00 [received]2024/11/18 00:00 [accepted]2024/12/20 06:24 [medline]2024/12/20 06:23 [pubmed]2024/12/20 04:14 [entrez]2024/12/18 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1177_11779322241306290 [pii]10.1177/11779322241306290 [doi]","epublish","Bioinform Biol Insights. 2024 Dec 18;18:11779322241306290. doi: 10.1177/11779322241306290. eCollection 2024.","© The Author(s) 2024.",NA,NA,"10.1177/11779322241306290",NA,2024

The mechanism of decreasing blood glucose is believed to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis by increasing muscular glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity. Recent studies suggest that metformin may reduce cancer risk; however, its anticancer mechanism in gastric cancers remains unclear. Here, we aim to evaluate the anticancer effects of metformin on human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells. Our results showed that metformin inhibited AGS cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Using small-scale quantitative proteomics, we identified 177 differentially expressed proteins upon metformin treatment; among these, nine proteins such as 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 2 (PSMD2), stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), and adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) were significantly altered. We found that metformin induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, suppressed cell migration, and affected cytoskeleton distribution. Additionally, patients with highly expressed PSMD2, STIP1, and CAP1 have a poor clinical outcome. Our study provides a novel view of developing therapies for gastric cancer.","Wang, Wei-HsuanChen, Szu-KaiHuang, Hsuan-ChengJuan, Hsueh-Fen","Wang WHChen SKHuang HCAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-3386-0934Juan HFAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4876-3309","Genome and Systems Biology Degree Program, Academia Sinica and National Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.Institute of Biomedical Informatics, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei 11221, Taiwan.Genome and Systems Biology Degree Program, Academia Sinica and National Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.Department of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics, National Taiwan University, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20210526","United States","ACS Omega","ACS omega","101691658",NA,NA,NA,"PMC8190800",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare no competing financial interest.","2021/06/15 06:00","2021/06/15 06:01","2021/05/26","2021/06/14 09:55","2021/02/18 00:00 [received]2021/05/14 00:00 [accepted]2021/06/14 09:55 [entrez]2021/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]2021/06/15 06:01 [medline]2021/05/26 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1021/acsomega.1c00894 [doi]","epublish","ACS Omega. 2021 May 26;6(22):14208-14219. doi: 10.1021/acsomega.1c00894. eCollection 2021 Jun 8.","© 2021 The Authors.

In order to identify potential oxidative biomarkers in the blood plasma of patients with T2DM, we used LC-MS/MS-based proteomics to profile plasma samples from patients with T2DM and healthy controls. The results showed that human serum albumin (HSA) is damaged by irreversible cysteine trioxidation, which can be a potential oxidative stress biomarker for the early diagnosis of T2DM. The quantitative detection of site-specific thiol trioxidation is technically challenging; thus, we developed a sensitive and selective LC-MS/MS workflow that has been used to discover and quantify three unique thiol-trioxidized HSA peptides, ALVLIAFAQYLQQC((SO3H))PFEDHVK (m/z 1241.13), YIC((SO3H))ENQDSISSK (m/z 717.80) and RPC((SO3H))FSALEVDETYVPK (m/z 951.45), in 16 individual samples of healthy controls (n = 8) and individuals with diabetes (n = 8).

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is currently the most dominant chronic liver disease in Western countries due to the fact that hepatic steatosis is associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome and drug-induced injury. A variety of chemicals, mainly drugs, and diets is known to cause hepatic steatosis in humans and rodents. Experimental non-alcoholic fatty liver disease models rely on the application of a diet or the administration of drugs to laboratory animals or the exposure of hepatic cell lines to these drugs. More recently, genetically modified rodents or zebrafish have been introduced as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease models. Considerable interest now lies in the discovery and development of novel non-invasive biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, with specific focus on hepatic steatosis. Experimental diagnostic biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, such as (epi)genetic parameters and '-omics'-based read-outs are still in their infancy, but show great promise. In this paper, the array of tools and models for the study of liver steatosis is discussed. Furthermore, the current state-of-art regarding experimental biomarkers such as epigenetic, genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabonomic biomarkers will be reviewed.","Willebrords, JoostPereira, Isabel Veloso AlvesMaes, MichaëlCrespo Yanguas, SaraColle, IsabelleVan Den Bossche, BertDa Silva, Tereza Cristinade Oliveira, Cláudia Pinto Marques SouzaAndraus, WellingtonAlves, Venâncio AvanciniCogliati, BrunoVinken, Mathieu","Willebrords JPereira IVMaes MCrespo Yanguas SColle IVan Den Bossche BDa Silva TCde Oliveira CPAndraus WAlves VACogliati BVinken M","Department of In Vitro Toxicology and Dermato-Cosmetology, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, 1090 Brussels, Belgium.

METHODS: Two different groups of adults were studied. Group I consisted of 8 individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 8 with T2DM, subjected to SKLM mitochondrial proteome analysis by 2D-gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry-based protein identification. Group II included 24 individuals with NGT and 24 with T2DM, whose SKLM biopsies were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Of the 24 subjects with T2DM, 20 were randomized to receive placebo or PIO (15 mg daily) for 6 months. After 6 months of treatment, SKLM biopsy was repeated. RESULTS: Mitochondrial proteomic analysis on Group I revealed that several mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative metabolism were differentially expressed between T2DM and NGT groups, with a downregulation of ATP synthase alpha chain (ATP5A), electron transfer flavoprotein alpha-subunit (ETFA), cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIb isoform 1 (CX6B1), pyruvate dehydrogenase protein X component (ODPX), dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLDH), dihydrolipoamide-S-succinyltransferase (DLST), and mitofilin, and an up-regulation of hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (HCDH), 3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA-isomerase (D3D2) and delta3,5-delta2,4-dienoyl-CoA-isomerase (ECH1) in T2DM as compared to NGT subjects. By immunoblot analysis on SKLM lysates obtained from Group II we confirmed that, in comparison to NGT subjects, those with T2DM exhibited lower protein levels of ATP5A (-30%, P = 0.006), ETFA (-50%, P = 0.02), CX6B1 (-30%, P = 0.03), key factors for ATP biosynthesis, and of the structural protein mitofilin (-30%, P = 0.01). T2DM was associated with a reduced abundance of the enzymes involved in the Krebs cycle DLST and ODPX (-20%, P ≤ 0.05) and increased levels of HCDH and ECH1, enzymes implicated in the fatty acid catabolism (+30%, P ≤ 0.05). In subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with PIO for 6 months we found a restored SKLM protein abundance of ATP5A, ETFA, CX6B1, and mitofilin. Moreover, protein levels of HCDH and ECH1 were reduced by -10% and - 15% respectively (P ≤ 0.05 for both) after PIO treatment. CONCLUSION: Type 2 diabetes is associated with reduced levels of mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and an increased abundance of enzymes implicated in fatty acid catabolism in SKLM. PIO treatment is able to improve SKLM mitochondrial proteomic profile in subjects with T2DM.","Fiorentino, Teresa VanessaMonroy, AdrianaKamath, SubashSotero, RosaCas, Michele DeiDaniele, GiuseppeChavez, Alberto OAbdul-Ghani, MuhammadHribal, Marta LetiziaSesti, GiorgioTripathy, DevjitDeFronzo, Ralph AFolli, Franco","Fiorentino TVMonroy AKamath SSotero RCas MDDaniele GChavez AOAbdul-Ghani MHribal MLSesti GTripathy DDeFronzo RAFolli F","Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy; Division of Diabetes, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States of America.Division of Diabetes, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States of America; Oncology, General Hospital of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.Division of Diabetes, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States of America.Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.Clinical Biochemistry and Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Department of Health Science, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.Division of Diabetes, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States of America.Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.Division of Diabetes, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States of America.Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, University of Rome-Sapienza, Rome, Italy.Division of Diabetes, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States of America.Division of Diabetes, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States of America.Division of Diabetes, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, United States of America; Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Health Science, University of Milan, Diabetologia e Malattie Metaboliche, Aziende Socio Sanitarie Territoriali Santi Paolo e Carlo, Milan, Italy.

Free fatty acids (FFAs) are believed to play important roles in the occurrence of cardiovascular disease in people with T2DM. The aim of this study was to investigate the fingerprint of plasma FFAs and their correlations with the tradition risk factors of cardiovascular disease in T2DM patients complicated by coronary heart disease (CHD-T2DM). A total of 401 participants, including healthy control (HC, n = 143), T2DM patients (n = 134), and CHD-T2DM patients (n = 126) were enrolled in this study. Plasma levels of 36 FFAs with carbon chain length ranged from 3 to 22 were quantified by using reverse phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Tradition risk factors of cardiovascular disease were tested in clinical laboratory, including homocysteine (HCY), creatine kinase (CK), high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and so on. Almost all the FFAs with different carbon chain length and unsaturation were significantly upregulated in the T2DM-CHD groups, compared to the HC and T2DM groups. Both n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were also found to be significantly upregulated in T2DM-CHD group compared to the T2DM group. However, no significantly differences of the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, arachidonic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid (AA/EPA) ratio, and arachidonic acid/docosahexaenoic acid (AA/DHA) ratio were observed between T2DM-CHD and T2DM groups. Plasma FFA levels were found to be positively correlated with HCY, CK, hsCRP, NT-proBNP and other tradition risk factors of CHD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that a dozens of FFAs were the independent risk factors of CHD after adjustment for confounding factors and other risk factors. Excessively high plasma levels of FFAs were demonstrated to be independent risk factors for CHD in patients with T2DM, despite of the differences in chain length, unsaturation, and double bond position.","Hu, TingZhang, WenHan, FeifeiZhao, RuiLiu, LihongAn, Zhuoling","Hu TZhang WHan FZhao RLiu LAn Z","Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20220722","Switzerland","Front Cardiovasc Med","Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine","101653388",NA,NA,NA,"PMC9355375",NA,"NOTNLM","coronary heart diseasefingerprintfree fatty acidrisk factortype 2 diabetes mellitus","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","2022/08/09 06:00","2022/08/09 06:01","2022/07/22","2022/08/08 03:35","2022/03/25 00:00 [received]2022/07/05 00:00 [accepted]2022/08/08 03:35 [entrez]2022/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]2022/08/09 06:01 [medline]2022/07/22 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.3389/fcvm.2022.903412 [doi]","epublish","Front Cardiovasc Med. 2022 Jul 22;9:903412. doi: 10.3389/fcvm.2022.903412. eCollection 2022.","Copyright © 2022 Hu, Zhang, Han, Zhao, Liu and An.",NA,NA,"10.3389/fcvm.2022.903412",NA,2022

Despite shared similarities, T1D is an autoimmune disease with evidence of autoantibody production, as well as a role for exocrine pancreas involvement. Our hypothesis is that differential protein expression occurs in disease stratified pancreas tissues and regulated proteins from endocrine and exocrine tissues are potential markers of disease and potential therapeutic targets. The study objective was to identify novel proteins that distinguish the pancreas from donors with T1D from the pancreas from patients with T2D, or autoantibody positive non-diabetic donors. Detailed quantitative comprehensive proteomic analysis was applied to snap frozen human pancreatic tissue lysates from organ donors without diabetes, with T1D-associated autoantibodies in the absence of diabetes, with T1D, or with T2D. These disease-stratified human pancreas tissues contain exocrine and endocrine tissues (with dysfunctional islets) in the same microenvironment. The expression profiles of several of the proteins were further verified by western blot. We identified protein panels that are significantly and uniquely upregulated in the three disease-stratified pancreas tissues compared to non-disease control tissues. These proteins are involved in inflammation, metabolic regulation, and autoimmunity, all of which are pathways linked to, and likely involved in, T1 and T2 diabetes pathogenesis. Several new proteins were differentially upregulated in prediabetic, T1D, and T2D pancreas. The results identify proteins that could serve as novel prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic tools to preserve functional islet mass in Type 1 Diabetes.","Burch, Tanya CMorris, Margaret ACampbell-Thompson, MarthaPugliese, AlbertoNadler, Jerry LNyalwidhe, Julius O","Burch TCMorris MACampbell-Thompson MPugliese ANadler JLNyalwidhe JO","Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, VA, United States of America; Leroy T.

The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (HIEC) is the gold standard for the assessment of insulin sensitivity (IS). We have previously shown that insulin sensitivity, measured by HIEC, varied widely among a group of 60 young healthy men with normoglycemia. The aim of this study was to correlate the proteomic profile of skeletal muscles to insulin sensitivity. METHODS: Muscle biopsies from 16 subjects having the highest (M ≥ 13; n = 8, HIS) and lowest (M ¾ 6, n = 8, LIS) IS were obtained at baseline and during insulin infusion after stabilization of the blood glucose level and glucose infusion rate at the end of the HIEC. The samples were processed using a quantitative proteomic analysis approach. RESULTS: At baseline, 924 proteins were identified in the HIS and LIS groups. Among the 924 proteins detected in both groups, three were suppressed and three were increased significantly in the LIS subjects compared with the HIS subjects. Following insulin infusion, 835 proteins were detected in both groups. Among the 835 proteins, two showed differential responsiveness to insulin; ATP5F1 protein was decreased, and MYLK2 was higher in the LIS group compared with that in the HIS group. Our data suggest that alteration in mitochondrial proteins and an increased number of proteins involved in fast-twitch fiber correlate to insulin sensitivity in healthy young Arab men. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a change in a small number of differentially expressed proteins. A possible reason for this small change could be our study cohorts representing a homogeneous and healthy population. Additionally, we show differences in protein levels from skeletal muscle in low and high insulin sensitivity groups. Therefore, these differences may represent early events for the development of insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and type 2 diabetes.","Bettahi, IlhamKrishnankutty, RoopeshJaganjac, MoranaSuleiman, Noor Nabeel MRamanjaneya, ManjunathJerobin, JayakumarHassoun, ShaimaaAlkasem, MeisAbdelhakam, IbrahemIskandarani, AhmadSamra, Tareq AMohamed-Ali, VidyaAbou-Samra, Abdul Badi","Bettahi IKrishnankutty RJaganjac MSuleiman NNMRamanjaneya MJerobin JHassoun SAlkasem MAbdelhakam IIskandarani ASamra TAMohamed-Ali VAbou-Samra AB","Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Division of Molecular Medicine, Ruder Boskovic Institute, Zagreb, Croatia.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Anti-doping Laboratory, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Doha, Qatar.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20230217","Switzerland","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Frontiers in endocrinology","101555782","0 (Insulin)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IM","MaleHumans*Insulin ResistanceProteomicsArabs*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2Glucose Clamp TechniqueInsulinBiopsyGlucoseMuscle, Skeletal","PMC9982120",NA,"NOTNLM","HIECdiabetesinsulin resistanceinsulin sensitivitymitochondriaproteomics","Authors IB, RK, NS, MR, JJ, SH, MA, IA, AI and AA-S are employed by the Hamad Medical Corporation.

The main objectives of the present study were to characterize the plasma SP profile in fasting T2D patients and to determine whether SP are modified in postprandial TGRL from these patients compared to fasting TGRL. In a randomized parallel-group study, 30 T2D women ingested a breakfast including 20g lipids from either hazelnut cocoa palm oil-rich spread (Palm Nut) or Butter. Plasma was collected and TGRL were isolated by ultracentrifugation at fasting and 4h after the meal. Fasting samples of 6 control subjects from another cohort were analyzed for comparison. SP were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma from fasting T2D patients had higher ceramide (Cer) and ganglioside GM3 concentrations, and lower concentrations of sphingosylphosphorylcholine vs healthy subjects. In postprandial TGRL from T2D patients compared to those in the fasting state, Cer concentrations and especially C16:0, C24:1 and C24:0 molecular species, increased after the Palm Nut or Butter breakfast. A positive correlation was observed in the Palm Nut group between changes (Δ4h-fasting) of summed C16:0+C22:0+C24:1+C24:0 Cer concentrations in TGRL, and changes in plasma TG, TGRL-TG and TGRL-C16:0 concentrations. Altogether in T2D, the altered profile of plasma SP and the increased Cer concentrations in postprandial TGRL could contribute to the increased atherogenicity of TGRL.","Boulet, Marie MichèleCalzada, CatherinePettazzoni, MagaliLelekov-Boissard, TaïssiaBuisson, CharlineDi Filippo, MathildeDurand, AnnieLambert-Porcheron, StéphanieNazare, Julie-AnneMoulin, PhilippeMichalski, Marie-CarolineCheillan, David","Boulet MMCalzada CPettazzoni MLelekov-Boissard TBuisson CDi Filippo MDurand ALambert-Porcheron SNazare JAMoulin PMichalski MCCheillan D","Univ-Lyon, CarMeN Laboratory, Inserm U1060, INRAE UMR1397, INSA-Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69310, Pierre Bénite, France.Univ-Lyon, CarMeN Laboratory, Inserm U1060, INRAE UMR1397, INSA-Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69310, Pierre Bénite, France.Service de Biochimie et de Biologie Moléculaire, Centre de Biologie et de Pathologie Est, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69677, Bron, France.Fédération d'Endocrinologie, Diabétologie, Maladies Métaboliques, et Nutrition, Hôpital Louis Pradel, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69677, Bron, France.Univ-Lyon, CarMeN Laboratory, Inserm U1060, INRAE UMR1397, INSA-Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69310, Pierre Bénite, France.Univ-Lyon, CarMeN Laboratory, Inserm U1060, INRAE UMR1397, INSA-Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69310, Pierre Bénite, France; Service de Biochimie et de Biologie Moléculaire, Centre de Biologie et de Pathologie Est, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69677, Bron, France.Univ-Lyon, CarMeN Laboratory, Inserm U1060, INRAE UMR1397, INSA-Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69310, Pierre Bénite, France.Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Rhône-Alpes, Univ-Lyon, CarMeN Laboratory, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Hospices Civils de Lyon, CENS, FCRIN/FORCE Network, 69310, Pierre Bénite, France.Univ-Lyon, CarMeN Laboratory, Inserm U1060, INRAE UMR1397, INSA-Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69310, Pierre Bénite, France; Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Rhône-Alpes, Univ-Lyon, CarMeN Laboratory, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Hospices Civils de Lyon, CENS, FCRIN/FORCE Network, 69310, Pierre Bénite, France.Univ-Lyon, CarMeN Laboratory, Inserm U1060, INRAE UMR1397, INSA-Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69310, Pierre Bénite, France; Fédération d'Endocrinologie, Diabétologie, Maladies Métaboliques, et Nutrition, Hôpital Louis Pradel, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69677, Bron, France.Univ-Lyon, CarMeN Laboratory, Inserm U1060, INRAE UMR1397, INSA-Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69310, Pierre Bénite, France.Univ-Lyon, CarMeN Laboratory, Inserm U1060, INRAE UMR1397, INSA-Lyon, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, 69310, Pierre Bénite, France; Service de Biochimie et de Biologie Moléculaire, Centre de Biologie et de Pathologie Est, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69677, Bron, France.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood metabolite levels in the amino acid, biogenic amine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine (PC), carnitines, and hexose classes were analyzed in nondiabetic control (n = 27), T2DM without DPNP (n = 58), and T2DM with DPNP (n = 29) using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Variable importance projection (VIP) evaluation by partial least squares discriminant analysis was performed on clinical parameters and metabolites. RESULTS: Sixteen variables with VIP > 1.0 (P < 0.05) were identified across all patient groups, and 5 variables were identified to discriminate between the two T2DM groups. DPNP patients showed elevated fasting blood glucose, glutamate, PC aa C36:1, lysoPC a C18:1, and lysoPC a C18:2, while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, phenylalanine, and tryptophan were reduced. Glutamate, lysoPC a C18:1, and lysoPC a C18:2 discriminated T2DM with DPNP from those without DPNP with an AUC of 0.671. The AUC was improved to 0.765 when ratios of metabolite pairs were considered. INTERPRETATION: Blood metabolites include glutamate, and phospholipid-related metabolites implicated in neuropathic pain may have the potential as biomarkers for DPNP. Further investigation is required to understand the mechanism of action of these altered metabolites in DPNP.","Kuo, Hung-ChouLin, Chia-NiTsai, Sung-ShengChen, Chiung-MeiLyu, Rong-KuoChu, Chun-CheRo, Long-SunLiao, Ming-FengChang, Hong-ShiuWeng, Yi-ChingHwang, Jawl-Shan","Kuo HCAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8738-6476Lin CNTsai SSChen CMLyu RKChu CCRo LSLiao MFChang HSWeng YCHwang JS","Department of Neurology, Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.Department of Medical Biotechnology and Laboratory Science, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.Department of Neurology, Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.Department of Neurology, Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.Department of Neurology, Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.Department of Neurology, Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.Department of Neurology, Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.Department of Neurology, Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.Department of Neurology, Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.","eng","CMRPG3G1441/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou/CMRPG3J1751/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou/CMRPG3K1871/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou/MOST 105-2314-B-182A-007/Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan/","Journal Article","20241116","Japan","J Diabetes Investig","Journal of diabetes investigation","101520702","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Glucose)","IM","Humans*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/complicationsMale*Diabetic Neuropathies/blood/etiologyFemaleMiddle Aged*Metabolomics/methods*Biomarkers/bloodAgedCase-Control StudiesMetabolomeNeuralgia/blood/etiologyBlood Glucose/analysis/metabolism","PMC11786186",NA,"NOTNLM","Diabetic peripheral neuropathic painMetabolomicsType 2 diabetes mellitus","The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Urinary protein biomarkers may be used to monitor or predict patient status. Urine samples were selected from patients enrolled in the retrospective diabetic kidney disease (DKD) study, including 35 with good and 19 with poor prognosis. After removal of albumin and immunoglobulin, the remaining proteins were reduced, alkylated, digested, and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively with a nano LC-MS platform. Each protein was identified, and its concentration normalized to that of creatinine. A prognostic model of DKD was formulated based on the adjusted quantities of each protein in the two groups. Of 1296 proteins identified in the 54 urine samples, 66 were differentially abundant in the two groups (area under the curve (AUC): p-value < 0.05), but none showed significantly better performance than albumin. To improve the predictive power by multivariate analysis, five proteins (ACP2, CTSA, GM2A, MUC1, and SPARCL1) were selected as significant by an AUC-based random forest method. The application of two classifiers-support vector machine and random forest-showed that the multivariate model performed better than univariate analysis of mucin-1 (AUC: 0.935 vs. 0.791) and albumin (AUC: 1.0 vs. 0.722). The urinary proteome can reflect kidney function directly and can predict the prognosis of patients with chronic kidney dysfunction. Classification based on five urinary proteins may better predict the prognosis of DKD patients than urinary albumin concentration or eGFR.","Ahn, Hee-SungKim, Jong HoJeong, HwangkyoYu, JiyoungYeom, JeonghunSong, Sang HeonKim, Sang SooKim, In JooKim, Kyunggon","Ahn HSAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2241-6536Kim JHJeong HYu JYeom JSong SHAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8218-6974Kim SSAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9687-8357Kim IJKim K","Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, Seoul 05505, Korea.Department of Internal Medicine and Biomedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan 49241, Korea.Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul 05505, Korea.Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, Seoul 05505, Korea.Convergence Medicine Research Center, Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Seoul 05505, Korea.Department of Internal Medicine and Biomedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan 49241, Korea.Department of Internal Medicine and Biomedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan 49241, Korea.Department of Internal Medicine and Biomedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan 49241, Korea.Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, Seoul 05505, Korea.Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul 05505, Korea.Clinical Proteomics Core Laboratory, Convergence Medicine Research Center, Asan Medical Center, Seoul 05505, Korea.Bio-Medical Institute of Technology, Asan Medical Center, Seoul 05505, Korea.","eng","Biomedical Research Institute Grant (2017-20)/Pusan National University Hospital/","Comparative StudyJournal Article","20200614","Switzerland","Int J Mol Sci","International journal of molecular sciences","101092791","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)0 (G(M2) Activator Protein)0 (MUC1 protein, human)0 (Mucin-1)0 (SPARCL1 protein, human)EC 3.1.3.2 (ACP2 protein, human)EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)EC 3.4.16.5 (CTSA protein, human)EC 3.4.16.5 (Cathepsin A)","IM","Acid Phosphatase/urineAdultAgedBiomarkers/*urineCalcium-Binding Proteins/urineCase-Control StudiesCathepsin A/urineChromatography, LiquidDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*urineDiabetic Nephropathies/etiology/*urineExtracellular Matrix Proteins/urineFemaleG(M2) Activator Protein/urineHumansMaleMass SpectrometryMiddle AgedMucin-1/urinePrognosisProteomics/*methodsRetrospective StudiesSupport Vector MachineUrine/*chemistry","PMC7352871",NA,"NOTNLM","diabetic kidney diseasekidney functionmachine learningmass spectrometryproteomicsstatistical clinical modelurine","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","2020/06/18 06:00","2021/02/18 06:00","2020/06/01","2020/06/18 06:00","2020/04/03 00:00 [received]2020/06/05 00:00 [revised]2020/06/12 00:00 [accepted]2020/06/18 06:00 [entrez]2020/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]2021/02/18 06:00 [medline]2020/06/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","ijms21124236 [pii]ijms-21-04236 [pii]10.3390/ijms21124236 [doi]","epublish","Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jun 14;21(12):4236. doi: 10.3390/ijms21124236.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/ijms21124236",NA,2020

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 120 participants (aged 61.5-69.5 years) with type 2 diabetes and 60 (aged 62.5-73.5 years) with normal glucose tolerance in the discovery group from the original Da Qing Diabetes Study. Their diabetes status was confirmed in 1986; then, the participants were followed over 23 years to collect CVD outcome data. Untargeted and targeted metabolomics analyses based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used to identify potential markers. Multivariable regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between metabolites and CVD outcomes. An independent group of 335 patients (aged 67.0-77.0 years) with diabetes was used for biomarker validation. RESULTS: In the discovery group, untargeted metabolomics analysis found 16 lipids and fatty acids metabolites associated with CVD risk in patients with diabetes, with palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM) having the strongest association. Plasma PSM concentrations were significantly higher in cases of diabetes with CVD than without (41.68 ± 10.47 vs. 9.69 ± 1.47 μg/mL; P < 0.0001). The odds ratio (OR) of CVD for 1 µg/mL PSM change was 1.19 (95% CI 1.13-1.25) after adjustment of clinical confounders. The validation study confirmed that PSM was significantly associated with increased CVD risk in diabetes (OR 1.22 [95% CI 1.16-1.30]). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in lipid and fatty acid content were significantly associated with CVD risk in the Chinese population with diabetes. PSM is a potential biomarker of increased CVD risk in diabetes.","Chen, YanyanJia, HongmeiQian, XinWang, JinpingYu, MengGong, QiuhongAn, YaliLi, HuiLi, SidongShi, NaZou, ZhongmeiLi, Guangwei","Chen YAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4697-149XJia HQian XAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2961-3380Wang JYu MGong QAn YLi HLi SShi NZou ZLi GAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-1061-7293","Endocrinology Centre, Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.Department of Endocrinology, Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Shenzhen, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.Endocrinology Centre, Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.Department of Cardiology, Da Qing First Hospital, Da Qing, China.Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.Endocrinology Centre, Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.Endocrinology Centre, Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.Department of Cardiology, Da Qing First Hospital, Da Qing, China.Medical Research and Biometrics Center, Fuwai Hospital, National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.Endocrinology Centre, Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.Endocrinology Centre, Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.Department of Endocrinology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tResearch Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",NA,"United States","Diabetes Care","Diabetes care","7805975","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Sphingomyelins)","IMEIN  Diabetes Care. 2022 Jul 7;45(7):1699. doi: 10.2337/dc22-er07a.

To evaluate the effect of glycemic levels in middle-aged and elderly individuals with T2DM on salivary proteomics, we compared the differences by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Unstimulated whole saliva samples from 8 T2DM patients with good glycemic control (G group, HbA1c <6.5%) and 16 patients with poor control (P group, HbA1c ≥6.5%) were analyzed by LC-MS/MS in the data-independent acquisition mode (Clinical register number: ChiCTR1900023582.). After functional annotation, cluster analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were carried out to screen and evaluate candidate proteins. A total of 5,721 proteins were quantified, while 40 proteins differed significantly. In the P group, proteins involved in oxidative stress-related processes were upregulated, whereas proteins related to salivary secretion were downregulated. The combination of thioredoxin domain-containing protein 17, zymogen granule protein 16B, and FAM3 metabolism regulating signaling molecule D yielded an area under the curve of 0.917 which showed a robust ability to distinguish the P and G groups. In conclusion, poorly controlled hyperglycemia may affect salivary proteins through various pathways, including oxidative stress and glandular secretion. Furthermore, the differentially expressed proteins, especially the three proteins with the best differentiation, might serve as an anchor point for the further study of hyperglycemia and oral diseases.","Jia, Shu YuanZhang, Yan LingSun, Xiang YuYuan, ChaoZheng, Shu Guo","Jia SYZhang YLSun XYYuan CZheng SG","Department of Preventive Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, National Center of Stomatology, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology, Beijing, China.Department of Periodontology, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, National Center of Stomatology, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology, Beijing, China.Department of Preventive Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, National Center of Stomatology, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology, Beijing, China.Department of Preventive Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, National Center of Stomatology, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology, Beijing, China.Department of Preventive Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, National Center of Stomatology, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology, Beijing, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20211210","Switzerland","Front Mol Biosci","Frontiers in molecular biosciences","101653173",NA,NA,NA,"PMC8703016",NA,"NOTNLM","Data-independent acquisitionmass spectrometryoxidative stresssalivary proteomesalivary secretiontype 2 diabetes mellitus","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","2021/12/28 06:00","2021/12/28 06:01","2021/01/01","2021/12/27 06:34","2021/10/06 00:00 [received]2021/11/22 00:00 [accepted]2021/12/27 06:34 [entrez]2021/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]2021/12/28 06:01 [medline]2021/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","790091 [pii]10.3389/fmolb.2021.790091 [doi]","epublish","Front Mol Biosci. 2021 Dec 10;8:790091. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2021.790091. eCollection 2021.","Copyright © 2021 Jia, Zhang, Sun, Yuan and Zheng.",NA,NA,"10.3389/fmolb.2021.790091",NA,2021

Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry (SWATH-MS) was done on samples taken at 4 months before (baseline) and 6 and 12 months after BS. Four hundred sixty-seven proteins were quantified by SWATH-MS. Principal component analysis resolved samples from distinct time points after selection of key discriminatory proteins: 25 proteins were differentially expressed between baseline and 6 months post-surgery; 39 proteins between baseline and 12 months. Eight proteins (SHBG, TF, PRG4, APOA4, LRG1, HSPA4, EPHX2 and PGLYRP) were significantly different to baseline at both 6 and 12 months post-surgery. The panel of proteins identified as consistently different included peptides related to insulin sensitivity (SHBG increase), systemic inflammation (TF and HSPA4-both decreased) and lipid metabolism (APOA4 decreased). We found significant changes in the proteome for eight proteins at 6and 12-months post-BS, and several of these are key components in metabolic and inflammatory pathways. These may represent potential biomarkers of remission of T2DM.","Iqbal, ZohaibFachim, Helene AGibson, J MartinBaricevic-Jones, IvonaCampbell, Amy EGeary, BethanyDonn, Rachelle PHamarashid, DashneSyed, AkheelWhetton, Anthony DSoran, HandreanHeald, Adrian H","Iqbal ZFachim HAGibson JMBaricevic-Jones ICampbell AEGeary BAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5592-5532Donn RPAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6976-9828Hamarashid DSyed AAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8696-7121Whetton ADAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1098-3878Soran HHeald AH","The School of Medicine and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, Manchester University, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Salford Royal Foundation Trust, Salford M6 8HD, UK.The School of Medicine and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, Manchester University, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Salford Royal Foundation Trust, Salford M6 8HD, UK.The School of Medicine and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, Manchester University, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Salford Royal Foundation Trust, Salford M6 8HD, UK.Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre, Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre, Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre, Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.The School of Medicine and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, Manchester University, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Salford Royal Foundation Trust, Salford M6 8HD, UK.Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Salford Royal Foundation Trust, Salford M6 8HD, UK.Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre, Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.Manchester National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester M13 9WL, UK.The School of Medicine and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, Manchester University, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.The School of Medicine and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, Manchester University, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Salford Royal Foundation Trust, Salford M6 8HD, UK.","eng","MR/M008959/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom","Journal Article","20210818","Switzerland","J Clin Med","Journal of clinical medicine","101606588",NA,NA,NA,"PMC8396849",NA,"NOTNLM","SWATH-MSbariatric surgerydiabetesproteomicsremission","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","2021/08/28 06:00","2021/08/28 06:01","2021/08/18","2021/08/27 01:11","2021/07/22 00:00 [received]2021/08/17 00:00 [revised]2021/08/17 00:00 [accepted]2021/08/27 01:11 [entrez]2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]2021/08/28 06:01 [medline]2021/08/18 00:00 [pmc-release]","jcm10163659 [pii]jcm-10-03659 [pii]10.3390/jcm10163659 [doi]","epublish","J Clin Med. 2021 Aug 18;10(16):3659. doi: 10.3390/jcm10163659.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/jcm10163659",NA,2021

The purpose of this study was to characterize the human salivary proteome in type-2 diabetes to identify potential biomarkers of diabetes. Whole saliva from control and type-2 diabetic individuals was characterized by multidimensional liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS). Label-free quantification was used to identify differentially abundant protein biomarkers. Selected potential biomarkers were then independently validated in saliva from control, diabetic, and prediabetic subjects by Western immunoblotting and ELISA. Characterization of the salivary proteome identified a total of 487 unique proteins. Approximately 33% of these have not been previously reported in human saliva. Of these, 65 demonstrated a greater than 2-fold difference in abundance between control and type-2 diabetes samples. A majority of the differentially abundant proteins belong to pathways regulating metabolism and immune response. Independent validation of a subset of potential biomarkers utilizing immunodetection confirmed their differential expression in type-2 diabetes, and analysis of prediabetic samples demonstrated a trend of relative increase in their abundance with progression from the prediabetic to the diabetic state. This comprehensive proteomic analysis of the human salivary proteome in type-2 diabetes provides the first global view of potential mechanisms perturbed in diabetic saliva and their utility in detection and monitoring of diabetes. Further characterization of these markers in a larger cohort of subjects may provide the basis for new, noninvasive tests for diabetes screening, detection, and monitoring.","Rao, Paturi VReddy, Ashok PLu, XinfangDasari, SurendraKrishnaprasad, AdirajuBiggs, EvanRoberts, Charles TNagalla, Srinivasa R","Rao PVReddy APLu XDasari SKrishnaprasad ABiggs ERoberts CTNagalla SR","Departments of Endocrinology and Metabolism and Medicine, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences University, Hyderabad 500 082, India.","eng",NA,"Journal Article",NA,"United States","J Proteome Res","Journal of proteome research","101128775","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Proteome)0 (Salivary Proteins and Peptides)","IM","AdultBiomarkers/analysis/*metabolismChromatography, Liquid/*methodsDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*diagnosis/*metabolismEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent AssayHumansInflammationMass ScreeningMass Spectrometry/*methodsMiddle AgedProspective StudiesProteomeProteomics/*methodsSaliva/*metabolismSalivary Proteins and Peptides/metabolism",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2009/01/03 09:00","2009/02/28 09:00",NA,"2009/01/03 09:00","2009/01/03 09:00 [entrez]2009/01/03 09:00 [pubmed]2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]","10.1021/pr8003776 [pii]10.1021/pr8003776 [doi]","ppublish","J Proteome Res. 2009 Jan;8(1):239-45. doi: 10.1021/pr8003776.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1021/pr8003776",NA,2009

This study was focused on: (i) testing of the HR MS and MS/MS feasibility and performances in mapping and sequencing of renal gangliosides in Type 2 DM patients; (ii) determination of the changes in the urine gangliosidome of DKD patients in different stages of the disease-normo-, micro-, and macroalbuminuria-in a comparative assay with healthy controls. Due to the high resolution and mass accuracy, the comparative MS screening revealed that the sialylation status of the ganglioside components; their modification by O-acetyl, CH(3)COO(-), O-fucosyl, and O-GalNAc; as well as the composition of the ceramide represent possible markers for early DKD detection, the assessment of disease progression, and follow-up treatment.

We quantified 14 candidate proteins using targeted mass spectrometry in plasma samples of the prospective, population-based German KORA F4/FF4 study (6.5-year follow-up). 892 participants aged 42-81 years were selected using a case-cohort design, including 123 persons with incident type 2 diabetes and 255 persons with incident WHO-defined prediabetes. Prospective associations between protein levels and diabetes, prediabetes as well as continuous fasting and 2 h glucose, fasting insulin and insulin resistance were investigated using regression models adjusted for established risk factors. The best predictive panel of proteins on top of a non-invasive risk factor model or on top of HbA1c, age, and sex was selected. Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase (MASP) levels were positively associated with both incident type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. Adiponectin was inversely associated with incident type 2 diabetes. MASP, adiponectin, apolipoprotein A-IV, apolipoprotein C-II, C-reactive protein, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase D1 were associated with individual continuous outcomes. The combination of MASP, apolipoprotein E (apoE) and adiponectin improved diabetes prediction on top of both reference models, while prediabetes prediction was improved by MASP plus CRP on top of the HbA1c model. In conclusion, our mass spectrometric approach revealed a novel association of MASP with incident type 2 diabetes and incident prediabetes. In combination, MASP, adiponectin and apoE improved type 2 diabetes prediction beyond non-invasive risk factors or HbA1c, age and sex.","Huth, Corneliavon Toerne, ChristineSchederecker, Floriande Las Heras Gala, ToniaHerder, ChristianKronenberg, FlorianMeisinger, ChristaRathmann, WolfgangKoenig, WolfgangWaldenberger, MelanieRoden, MichaelPeters, AnnetteHauck, Stefanie MThorand, Barbara","Huth CAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2421-433Xvon Toerne CAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4132-4322Schederecker Fde Las Heras Gala THerder CAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2050-093XKronenberg FAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2229-1120Meisinger CAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9026-6544Rathmann WKoenig WWaldenberger MRoden MPeters AAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6645-0985Hauck SMAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1630-6827Thorand BAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8416-6440","Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München  German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Ingolstädter Landstraße 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany. huth@helmholtz-muenchen.de.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany. huth@helmholtz-muenchen.de.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.Research Unit Protein Science, Helmholtz Zentrum München  German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München  German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Ingolstädter Landstraße 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München  German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Ingolstädter Landstraße 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Clinical Diabetology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.Division of Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Medical Genetics, Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München  German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Ingolstädter Landstraße 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.Chair of Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, UNIKA-T Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Biometrics and Epidemiology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.Department of Internal Medicine II  Cardiology, University of Ulm Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.Deutsches Herzzentrum München, Technische Universität München, Munich, Germany.German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner Site Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München  German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Ingolstädter Landstraße 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.Research Unit of Molecular Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München  German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Clinical Diabetology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.Division of Endocrinology and Diabetology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München  German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Ingolstädter Landstraße 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner Site Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.Research Unit Protein Science, Helmholtz Zentrum München  German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München  German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Ingolstädter Landstraße 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.","eng","DFG/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/RA 459/2-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/","Journal Article","20181231","Netherlands","Eur J Epidemiol","European journal of epidemiology","8508062","0 (Adiponectin)0 (Apolipoproteins E)0 (Biomarkers)EC 3.4.21.

Currently, the pathogenesis of T2DM-related sarcopenia remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for T2DM-related sarcopenia. In this study, a T2DM-related sarcopenia mouse model was established using db/db mice. Proteins extracted from the gastrocnemius muscles of db/db mice and littermate control db/m mice were analyzed by a 4D label-free quantitative proteomics approach. A total of 131 upregulated and 68 downregulated proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that DEPs were significantly enriched in lipid metabolism. Protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed that six hub proteins, including ACOX1, CPT2, ECI2, ACADVL, ACADL, and ECH1, were involved in the fatty acid oxidation. The hub protein-transcription factor-miRNA network was also constructed using the NetworkAnalyst tool. Finally, the hub proteins were validated by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry and further confirmed to be significantly negatively correlated with muscle mass and grip strength. Our study suggested that lipid metabolism, especially excessive fatty acid oxidation, may be a crucial contributor to the progression of T2DM-related sarcopenia and a common cause of the inter-relationship between T2DM and sarcopenia. Targeting lipid metabolism may be a promising therapeutic strategy for T2DM-related sarcopenia.","Wu, JingyingWang, ShengnanZhuang, HuafengWang, WeichunWang, YaoguoChen, YoufangHuang, ZhengpingChen, ChunnuanChen, Xiaofeng","Wu JWang SZhuang HWang WWang YChen YHuang ZChen CChen XAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2548-8175","Department of Cardiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, 950 Donghai Street, Fengze District, Quanzhou, Fujian Province 362000, China.Department of Cardiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, 950 Donghai Street, Fengze District, Quanzhou, Fujian Province 362000, China.Department of Orthopedics, Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, 950 Donghai Street, Fengze District, Quanzhou, Fujian Province 362000, China.Department of Cardiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, 950 Donghai Street, Fengze District, Quanzhou, Fujian Province 362000, China.Department of Cardiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, 950 Donghai Street, Fengze District, Quanzhou, Fujian Province 362000, China.Medical Research Center, Quanzhou Medical College, 2 Anji Road, Luojiang District, Quanzhou, Fujian Province 362000, China.Department of Clinical Medicine, Quanzhou Medical College, 2 Anji Road, Luojiang District, Quanzhou, Fujian Province 362000, China.Department of Neurology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, 950 Donghai Street, Fengze District, Quanzhou, Fujian Province 362000, China.Department of Neurology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, 950 Donghai Street, Fengze District, Quanzhou, Fujian Province 362000, China.Department of Cardiology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, 950 Donghai Street, Fengze District, Quanzhou, Fujian Province 362000, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240726","United States","ACS Omega","ACS omega","101691658",NA,NA,NA,"PMC11308078",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare no competing financial interest.","2024/08/12 12:43","2024/08/12 12:44","2024/07/26","2024/08/12 06:02","2024/05/16 00:00 [received]2024/07/07 00:00 [revised]2024/07/22 00:00 [accepted]2024/08/12 12:44 [medline]2024/08/12 12:43 [pubmed]2024/08/12 06:02 [entrez]2024/07/26 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1021/acsomega.4c04668 [doi]","epublish","ACS Omega. 2024 Jul 26;9(31):34056-34069. doi: 10.1021/acsomega.4c04668. eCollection 2024 Aug 6.","© 2024 The Authors.

METHODS: Using LC-MS with data-independent acquisition we evaluated four variables: plasma protein depletion, EDTA or citrated anti-coagulant blood collection tubes, plasma lipid depletion strategies and plasma freeze-thaw cycles. Optimised methods were applied in a pilot study of FIELD participants. RESULTS: LC-MS of undepleted plasma conducted over a 45 min gradient yielded 172 proteins after excluding immunoglobulin isoforms. Cibachrome-blue-based depletion yielded additional proteins but with cost and time expenses, while immunodepleting albumin and IgG provided few additional identifications. Only minor variations were associated with blood collection tube type, delipidation methods and freeze-thaw cycles. From 65 batches involving over 1500 injections, the median intra-batch quantitative differences in the top 100 proteins of the plasma external standard were less than 2%. Fenofibrate altered seven plasma proteins. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A robust plasma handling and LC-MS proteomics workflow for abundant plasma proteins has been developed for large-scale biomarker studies that balance proteomic depth with time and resource costs.","O'Rourke, Matthew BJanuszewski, Andrzej SSullivan, David RLengyel, ImreStewart, Alan JArya, SwatiMa, Ronald CGalande, SanjeevHardikar, Anandwardhan AJoglekar, Mugdha VKeech, Anthony CJenkins, Alicia JMolloy, Mark P","O'Rourke MBJanuszewski ASSullivan DRLengyel IStewart AJArya SMa RCGalande SHardikar AAJoglekar MVKeech ACJenkins AJMolloy MP","Bowel Cancer & Biomarker Lab, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.Centre for Inflammation, Centenary Institute, Sydney, Australia.School of Life Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia.NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.Department of Chemical Pathology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, NSW Health Pathology, Australia.Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Science, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, Belfast, UK.School of Medicine, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, UK.School of Medicine, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, UK.Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, India.NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Australia.Bowel Cancer & Biomarker Lab, School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20230322","Germany","Proteomics Clin Appl","Proteomics.

The Saccharina japonica byproducts after the production of algin contain a large amount of insoluble polysaccharide, which will cause a waste of resources if ignored. Soluble dietary fiber (SDF)prepared from waste byproducts of Saccharina japonica by alkaline hydrolysis method for the first time had a wrinkled microscopic surface and low crystallinity, which not only significantly reduced liver index, serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine amiotransferase (ALT), and liver fat accumulation damage to the livers of obese diabetic mice, but also activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to increase liver glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. By LC-MS/MS employing a Nexera UPLC tandem QE high-resolution mass spectrometer, the 6 potential biomarker metabolites were screened, namely glycerophosphocholine (GPC), phosphocholine (PCho), pantothenic acid, glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and betaine; several pathways of these metabolites were associated with lipid metabolism, glycogen metabolism, and amino acid metabolism in the liver were observed. This study further provided a detailed insight into the mechanisms of SDF from Saccharina japonica byproducts in regulating the livers of obese mice with type 2 diabetes and laid a reliable foundation for the further development and utilization of Saccharina japonica.","Zhang, LipingWang, XixiHe, YingyingCao, JunhanWang, KaiLin, HuanQu, ChangfengMiao, Jinlai","Zhang LWang XAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4633-2345He YAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8759-3157Cao JWang KLin HQu CMiao J","Department of Special Medicine, School of Basic Medicine, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China.Key Laboratory of Marine Eco-Environmental Science and Technology, First Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resource, Qingdao 266061, China.Key Laboratory of Marine Eco-Environmental Science and Technology, First Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resource, Qingdao 266061, China.Key Laboratory of Marine Eco-Environmental Science and Technology, First Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resource, Qingdao 266061, China.Key Laboratory of Marine Eco-Environmental Science and Technology, First Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resource, Qingdao 266061, China.Key Laboratory of Marine Eco-Environmental Science and Technology, First Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resource, Qingdao 266061, China.Key Laboratory of Marine Eco-Environmental Science and Technology, First Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resource, Qingdao 266061, China.Laboratory for Marine Drugs and Bioproducts, Qingdao Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao 266237, China.Key Laboratory of Marine Eco-Environmental Science and Technology, First Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resource, Qingdao 266061, China.Laboratory for Marine Drugs and Bioproducts, Qingdao Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao 266237, China.","eng","2018YFD0901103/National Key Research and Development Program of China/2020Q02/Basic Scientific Fund for National Public Research Institutes of China/32000074 and 42176130/Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number/ZR2019BD023 and ZR2021MD044/Natural Science Foundation of Shandong/2019TSCYCX-06/Tai Mountain Industry Leading Talent of Shan Dong/AA21196002/Guangxi Science and Technology Base and special talents/","Journal Article","20220121","Switzerland","Mar Drugs","Marine drugs","101213729","0 (Dietary Fiber)","IM","AnimalsChromatography, High Pressure LiquidDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental/complications/drug therapyDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*drug therapyDietary Fiber/*pharmacologyFemaleLaminaria/*metabolismLiver/*drug effects/metabolismMiceMice, ObeseTandem Mass Spectrometry","PMC8877147",NA,"NOTNLM","PI3K/AKTSaccharina japonicadietary fiberliver metabolomics","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","2022/02/25 06:00","2022/03/18 06:00","2022/01/21","2022/02/24 12:20","2021/12/14 00:00 [received]2022/01/14 00:00 [revised]2022/01/18 00:00 [accepted]2022/02/24 12:20 [entrez]2022/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]2022/03/18 06:00 [medline]2022/01/21 00:00 [pmc-release]","md20020091 [pii]marinedrugs-20-00091 [pii]10.3390/md20020091 [doi]","epublish","Mar Drugs. 2022 Jan 21;20(2):91. doi: 10.3390/md20020091.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/md20020091",NA,2022

The search for new and better biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy has, with a few exceptions, previously focused on either hypothesis-driven studies or urinary based investigations. To date only two studies have investigated the proteome of blood in search for new biomarkers, and these studies were conducted in sera from patients with type 2 diabetes. This is the first reported in depth proteomic study where plasma from type 1 diabetic patients was investigated with the goal of finding improved candidate biomarkers to predict diabetic nephropathy. In order to reach lower concentration proteins in plasma a pre-fractionation step, either hexapeptide bead-based libraries or anion exchange chromatography, was performed prior to surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis of plasma from a cross-sectional cohort of 123 type 1 diabetic patients previously diagnosed as normoalbuminuric, microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric, gave rise to 290 peaks clusters of which 16 were selected as the most promising biomarker candidates based on statistical performance, including independent component analysis. Four of the peaks that were discovered have been identified as transthyretin, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein C1 and cystatin C. Several yet unidentified proteins discovered by this novel approach appear to have more potential as biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the capacity of proteomic analysis of plasma, by confirming the presence of known biomarkers as well as revealing new biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy in plasma in type 1 diabetic patients.","Overgaard, Anne JulieHansen, Henning GramLajer, MariaPedersen, LykkeTarnow, LiseRossing, PeterMcGuire, James NPociot, Flemming","Overgaard AJHansen HGLajer MPedersen LTarnow LRossing PMcGuire JNPociot F","Department of Genome Biology, Hagedorn Research Institute, Gentofte, Denmark. juov@hagedorn.dk","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20100203","England","Proteome Sci","Proteome science","101170539",NA,NA,NA,"PMC2827395",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2010/03/09 06:00","2010/03/09 06:01","2010/02/03","2010/03/09 06:00","2009/11/13 00:00 [received]2010/02/03 00:00 [accepted]2010/03/09 06:00 [entrez]2010/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]2010/03/09 06:01 [medline]2010/02/03 00:00 [pmc-release]","1477-5956-8-4 [pii]10.1186/1477-5956-8-4 [doi]","epublish","Proteome Sci. 2010 Feb 3;8:4. doi: 10.1186/1477-5956-8-4.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1186/1477-5956-8-4",NA,2010

Therefore, we explored whether there was an association between plasma leucine-rich α-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) concentrations (i.e., a novel proinflammatory signaling molecule) and specific plasma ceramides in postmenopausal women with T2DM. Methods: We measured six previously identified plasma ceramides, which have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk [plasma Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer(d18:1/20:0), Cer(d18:1/22:0), Cer(d18:1/24:0) and Cer(d18:1/24:1)], amongst 99 Caucasian postmenopausal women with non-insulin-treated T2DM (mean age 72 ± 8 years, mean hemoglobin A1c 6.9 ± 0.7%), who consecutively attended our diabetes outpatient service during a 3-month period. Plasma ceramide and LRG1 concentrations were measured with a targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay and a Milliplex® MAP human cardiovascular disease magnetic bead kit, respectively. Results: In linear regression analyses, higher plasma LRG1 levels (1st tertile vs. 2nd and 3rd tertiles combined) were associated with higher levels of plasma Cer(d18:1/16:0) (standardized β coefficient: 0.289, p = 0.004), Cer(d18:1/18:0) (standardized β coefficient: 0.307, p = 0.002), Cer(d18:1/20:0) (standardized β coefficient: 0.261, p = 0.009) or Cer(d18:1/24:1) (standardized β coefficient: 0.343, p < 0.001). These associations remained significant even after adjusting for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol level, hemoglobin A1c, insulin resistance and statin use. Conclusions: The results of our pilot exploratory study suggest that higher plasma LRG1 concentration was associated with higher levels of specific high-risk plasma ceramide molecules in elderly postmenopausal women with metabolically well-controlled T2DM, even after adjusting for known cardiovascular risk factors and other potential confounding variables.","Mantovani, AlessandroCsermely, AlessandroSani, ElenaBeatrice, GiorgiaPetracca, GrazianaLunardi, GianluigiBonapace, StefanoLippi, GiuseppeTargher, Giovanni","Mantovani AAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7271-6329Csermely ASani EBeatrice GPetracca GLunardi GBonapace SLippi GAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9523-9054Targher GAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4325-3900","Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, 37126 Verona, Italy.Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, 37126 Verona, Italy.Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, 37126 Verona, Italy.Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, 37126 Verona, Italy.Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, 37126 Verona, Italy.Clinical Analysis Laboratory and Transfusion Medicine & Clinical Pharmacology, ""IRCCS Sacro Cuore-Don Calabria"" Hospital, 37024 Negrar, Italy.Division of Cardiology, ""IRCCS Sacro Cuore-Don Calabria"" Hospital, 37024 Negrar, Italy.Section of Clinical Biochemistry, Department of Medicine, University and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, 37126 Verona, Italy.Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, 37126 Verona, Italy.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20220705","Switzerland","Biomolecules","Biomolecules","101596414","0 (Ceramides)0 (Glycated Hemoglobin A)0 (Glycoproteins)0 (LRG1 protein, human)GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)","IM","AgedAged, 80 and over*Cardiovascular DiseasesCeramides/analysis*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2FemaleGlycated Hemoglobin/analysisGlycoproteins/*bloodHumansLeucineMiddle AgedPostmenopause","PMC9312999",NA,"NOTNLM","LRG1ceramidescytokinesdiabetes mellitusinflammationleucine-rich α-2 glycoprotein 1","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","2022/07/28 06:00","2022/07/29 06:00","2022/07/05","2022/07/27 01:06","2022/06/03 00:00 [received]2022/07/03 00:00 [revised]2022/07/03 00:00 [accepted]2022/07/27 01:06 [entrez]2022/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]2022/07/29 06:00 [medline]2022/07/05 00:00 [pmc-release]","biom12070943 [pii]biomolecules-12-00943 [pii]10.3390/biom12070943 [doi]","epublish","Biomolecules. 2022 Jul 5;12(7):943. doi: 10.3390/biom12070943.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/biom12070943",NA,2022

The urinary proteome is known to be a valuable field of study and has become one of the most attractive subdisciplines in clinical proteomics for human diseases. We have described the levels of protein biomarkers specific to diabetes mellitus type 2 in the Pakistani population using proteomic technology. METHODS: One hundred type 2 diabetes patients with 50 age and sex-matched normal healthy controls were recruited from Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. Urinary proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional liquid chromatography, using chromatofocusing in the first dimension and reverse-phase chromatography in the second, followed by mass spectrometric analysis. Levels of the proteins, which were found to vary in the diabetes type 2 patients compared to the controls, were then determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in all the samples. RESULTS: Levels of transthyretin, α-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor, and haptoglobin precursor decreased by 30.8%, 55.2%, and 81.45%, whereas levels of albumin, zinc α2 glycoprotein, retinol binding protein 4, and E-cadherin increased by 486.5%, 29.23%, 100%, and 693%, respectively, in the diabetes patients compared to the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in the levels of these identified protein biomarkers have been reported in other pathological states.

We interrogated urine proteomic profiles generated by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry with the aim of isolating a set of biomarkers able to reliably identify biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy and to establish a stringent correlation with the different patterns of renal injury. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten micrograms of urine proteins from 190 subjects (20 healthy subjects, 20 normoalbuminuric, and 18 microalbuminuric diabetic patients and 132 patients with biopsy-proven nephropathy: 65 diabetic nephropathy, 10 diabetic with nondiabetic CKD [nd-CKD], and 57 nondiabetic with CKD) were run using a CM10 ProteinChip array and analyzed by supervised learning methods (Classification and Regression Tree analysis). RESULTS: The classification model correctly identified 75% of patients with normoalbuminuria, 87.5% of those with microalbuminuria, and 87.5% of those with diabetic nephropathy when applied to a blinded testing set. Most importantly, it was able to reliably differentiate diabetic nephropathy from nd-CKD in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Among the best predictors of the classification model, we identified and validated two proteins, ubiquitin and β2-microglobulin. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest the presence of a specific urine proteomic signature able to reliably identify type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic glomerulosclerosis.","Papale, MassimoDi Paolo, SalvatoreMagistroni, RiccardoLamacchia, OlgaDi Palma, Anna MariaDe Mattia, AngelaRocchetti, Maria TeresaFurci, LucianaPasquali, SoniaDe Cosmo, SalvatoreCignarelli, MauroGesualdo, Loreto","Papale MDi Paolo SMagistroni RLamacchia ODi Palma AMDe Mattia ARocchetti MTFurci LPasquali SDe Cosmo SCignarelli MGesualdo L","Core Facility of Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry, Department of BioAgroMed, Faculty of Medicine, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20100729","United States","Diabetes Care","Diabetes care","7805975","0 (Proteome)","IM","Albuminuria/urineDiabetic Nephropathies/*diagnosis/*urineFemaleHumansMaleMass SpectrometryMiddle AgedProteome/*analysis","PMC2963504",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2010/07/31 06:00","2011/02/11 06:00","2011/11/01","2010/07/31 06:00","2010/07/31 06:00 [entrez]2010/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]2011/02/11 06:00 [medline]2011/11/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","dc10-0345 [pii]0345 [pii]10.2337/dc10-0345 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes Care. 2010 Nov;33(11):2409-15. doi: 10.2337/dc10-0345.

We recently developed and validated a straightforward metabolite-based test for the assessment of IR and IGT in a single LC-MS/MS method. Plasma samples were diluted with isotopically-labeled internal standards and extracted by simple protein precipitation. The extracts were analyzed by LC-MS/MS for the quantitation of 2-hydroxybutyric acid (0.500-40.0μg/mL), 3-hydroxybutyric acid (1.00-80.0μg/mL), 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid (0.500-20.0μg/mL), 1-linoleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (2.50-100μg/mL), oleic acid (10.0-400μg/mL), pantothenic acid (0.0100-0.800μg/mL), and serine (2.50-100μg/mL). Liquid chromatography was carried out on a reversed phase column with a run time of 3.1min and the mass spectrometer operated in negative MRM mode. Method validation was performed on three identical LC-MS/MS systems with five runs each. Sufficient linearity (R(2)>0.99) was observed for all the analytes over the ranges.

The NHS allocates £10 billion (9% of its budget) to manage diabetes. Metformin is the primary treatment for T2DM, but 35% of patients don't benefit from it, leading to complications. This study aims to delve into metformin's efficacy using clinical, genomic, and proteomic data to uncover new biomarkers and build a Machine Learning predictor for early metformin response detection. METHODS: Here we report analysis from a T2DM dataset of individuals prescribed metformin monotherapy from the Diastrat cohort recruited at the Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Northern Ireland. RESULTS: In the clinical data analysis, comparing responders (those achieving HbA1c ≤ 48 mmol/mol) to non-responders (with HbA1c > 48 mmol/mol), we identified that creatinine levels and bodyweight were more negatively correlated with response than non-response. In genomic analysis, we identified statistically significant (p-value <0.05) variants rs6551649 (LPHN3), rs6551654 (LPHN3), rs4495065 (LPHN3) and rs7940817 (TRPC6) which appear to differentiate the responders and non-responders. In proteomic analysis, we identified 15 statistically significant (p-value <0.05, q-value <0.05) proteomic markers that differentiate controls, responders, non-responders and treatment groups, out of which the most significant were HAOX1, CCL17 and PAI that had fold change ∼2. A machine learning model was build; the best model predicted non-responders with 83% classification accuracy. CONCLUSION: Further testing in prospective validation cohorts is required to determine the clinical utility of the proposed model.","Villikudathil, Angelina ThomasMc Guigan, Declan HEnglish, Andrew","Villikudathil ATMc Guigan DHEnglish A","Ulster University, Centre for Stratified Medicine, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences, Magee Campus, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom.

Here, we assessed the tear fluid of nondiabetic individuals, diabetic patients with no DR, and diabetic patients with nonproliferative DR (NPDR) or with proliferative DR (PDR) to find putative biomarkers for the diagnosis and staging of DR. METHODS: Tear fluid samples were collected using Schirmer test strips from a cohort with 12 controls and 54 Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) patients, and then analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS)-based shotgun proteomics and bead-based multiplex assay. Tear fluid-derived small extracellular vesicles (EVs) were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, Western Blotting, and nano tracking. RESULTS: Proteomics analysis revealed that among the 682 reliably quantified proteins in tear fluid, 42 and 26 were differentially expressed in NPDR and PDR, respectively, comparing to the control group. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD033101. By multicomparison analyses, we also found significant changes in 32 proteins. Gene ontology (GO) annotations showed that most of these proteins are associated with oxidative stress and small EVs. Indeed, we also found that tear fluid is particularly enriched in small EVs. T2D patients with NPDR have higher IL-2/-5/-18, TNF, MMP-2/-3/-9 concentrations than the controls. In the PDR group, IL-5/-18 and MMP-3/-9 concentrations were significantly higher, whereas IL-13 was lower, compared to the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results show alterations in tear fluid proteins profile in diabetic patients with retinopathy. Promising candidate biomarkers identified need to be validated in a large sample cohort.","Amorim, MadaniaMartins, BeatrizCaramelo, FranciscoGonçalves, ConceiçãoTrindade, GrimaldeSimão, JorgeBarreto,

However, their role in the interaction between COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes (T2D) has not been addressed. Here, we characterized the circulating EV proteomic and phosphoproteomic landscape in patients with and without T2D hospitalized with COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 acute respiratory illness (RSP). We detected differentially expressed protein and phosphoprotein signatures that effectively characterized the study groups. The trio of immunomodulatory and coagulation proteins C1QA, C1QB, and C1QC appeared to be a central cluster in both the COVID-19 and T2D functional networks. PKCβ appeared to be retained in cells by being diverted from EV pathways and contribute to the COVID-19 and T2D interaction via a PKC/BTK/TEC axis. EV-shuttled CASP3 and ROCK1 appeared to be coregulated and likely contribute to disease interactions in patients with COVID-19 and T2D. Predicted activation of AMPK, MAPK, and SYK appeared to also play important roles driving disease interaction. These results suggest that activated cellular kinases (i.e., PKC, AMPK, MAPK, and SYK) and multiple EV-shuttled kinases (i.e., PKCβ, BTK, TEC, MAP2K2, and ROCK1) may play key roles in severe COVID-19, particularly in patients with comorbid diabetes.","Nunez Lopez, Yury OIliuk, AntonCasu, AnnaParikh, AmaySmith, Joshua SCorbin, KarenLupu, DanielPratley, Richard E","Nunez Lopez YOIliuk ACasu AParikh ASmith JSCorbin KLupu DPratley RE","Translational Research Institute, AdventHealth Orlando, Orlando, FL 32804, United States.Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, United States; Tymora Analytical Operations, West Lafayette, IN 47906, United States.

It is therefore a technique of choice for the study of drug mode of action, side-effects, toxicity and resistance. It is also a valuable approach for the discovery of new drug targets. All these proteomic applications to pharmacological issues may be called pharmacoproteomics. The pharmacoproteomic approach could be particularly useful for the identification of molecular alterations implicated in type 2 diabetes and for further characterization of existing or new drugs. In oncology, proteomics is widely used for the identification of tumour-specific protein markers, and pharmacoproteomics is used for the evaluation of chemotherapy, particularly for the characterization of drug-resistance mechanisms. The large amount of data generated by pharmacoproteomic screening requires the use of bioinformatic tools to insure a pertinent interpretation. Herein, we review the applications of pharmacoproteomics to the study of type 2 diabetes and to chemoresistance in different types of cancer and the current state of this technology in these pathologies. We also suggest a number of bioinformatic solutions for proteomic data management.","Chapal, NicolasMolina, LaurenceMolina, FranckLaplanche, MarionPau, BernardPetit, Pierre","Chapal NMolina LMolina FLaplanche MPau BPetit P","INNODIA S.A.S., 8 rue de l'Ecole Normale, 34296 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.

The main source of fructose in vivo is the polyol pathway, and an increase in its activity leads to diabetic complications. Here, we aimed to demonstrate that GL can serve as an indicator of the polyol pathway activity. Additionally, we propose a novel approach for detecting GL in peripheral blood samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and evaluate its clinical usefulness. We successfully circumvent interference from fructoselysine, which shares the same molecular weight as GL, by performing ultrafiltration and hydrolysis without reduction, successfully generating adequate peaks for quantification in serum. Furthermore, using immortalized aldose reductase KO mouse Schwann cells, we demonstrate that GL reflects the downstream activity of the polyol pathway and that GL produced intracellularly is released into the extracellular space. Clinical studies reveal that GL levels in patients with type 2 diabetes are significantly higher than those in healthy participants, while N(δ)-(5-hydro-5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)ornithine (MG-H1) levels are significantly lower. Both GL and MG-H1 show higher values among patients with vascular complications; however, GL varies more markedly than MG-H1 as well as hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Furthermore, GL remains consistently stable under various existing drug treatments for type 2 diabetes, whereas MG-H1 is impacted. To the best of our knowledge, we provide important insights in predicting diabetic complications caused by enhanced polyol pathway activity via assessment of GL levels in peripheral blood samples from patients.","Yamaguchi, HirokoMatsumura, TakeshiSugawa, HikariNiimi, NaokoSango, KazunoriNagai, Ryoji","Yamaguchi HMatsumura TSugawa HNiimi NSango KNagai R","Laboratory of Food and Regulation Biology, Graduate School of Bioscience, Tokai University, Kumamoto, Japan.Department of Metabolic Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.Laboratory of Food and Regulation Biology, Department of Food and Life Science, School of Agriculture, Tokai University, Kumamoto, Japan.Diabetic Neuropathy Project, Department of Diseases and Infection, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.Diabetic Neuropathy Project, Department of Diseases and Infection, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.Laboratory of Food and Regulation Biology, Graduate School of Bioscience, Tokai University, Kumamoto, Japan; Laboratory of Food and Regulation Biology, Department of Food and Life Science, School of Agriculture, Tokai University, Kumamoto, Japan.

Malonyl ginsenosides (MGR) are the main natural ginsenosides in American ginseng. However, whether the malonyl ginsenosides in P. quinquefolius (PQ-MGR) possess antidiabetic effects has not been explored yet. In this study, the antidiabetic effects and the underlying mechanism of PQ-MGR in high-fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ)-induced T2DM mice were investigated. The chemical composition was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Our results showed that 14 malonyl ginsenosides were identified in the PQ-MGR. Among them, the content of m-Rb(1) represented about 77.4% of the total malonyl ginsenosides. After a 5-week experiment, the PQ-MGR significantly reduced the fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels and improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Furthermore, Western blot analysis demonstrated that the protein expressions of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-AMPK, p-ACC, PPAR(γ), and GLUT4 in the liver and skeletal muscle were significantly upregulated after PQ-MGR treatment. In contrast, the protein expressions of p-IRS1 and p-JNK were significantly downregulated. Our results revealed that PQ-MGR could ameliorate glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin resistance in T2DM via regulation of the insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphoinositide3-kinase/protein-kinase B (IRS1/PI3K/Akt) and AMP-activated protein kinase/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) pathways. These findings suggest that PQ-MGR may be used as an antidiabetic candidate drug for T2DM treatment.","Liu, ZhiQu, Chun-YuanLi, Jia-XinWang, Yan-FangLi, WeiWang, Chong-ZhiWang, Dong-ShengSong, JiaSun, Guang-ZhiYuan, Chun-Su","Liu ZAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9690-3233Qu CYLi JXWang YFLi WAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2988-4298Wang CZWang DSSong JSun GZYuan CS","College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China.Institute of Agricultural Modernization, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China.College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China.College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China.College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China.College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China.Tang Center for Herbal Medicine Research and The Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, United States.College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China.College of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China.Institute of Agricultural Modernization, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China.Tang Center for Herbal Medicine Research and The Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, United States.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20211206","United States","ACS Omega","ACS omega","101691658",NA,NA,NA,"PMC8675029",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare no competing financial interest.","2021/12/21 06:00","2021/12/21 06:01","2021/12/06","2021/12/20 06:23","2021/08/26 00:00 [received]2021/11/22 00:00 [accepted]2021/12/20 06:23 [entrez]2021/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]2021/12/21 06:01 [medline]2021/12/06 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1021/acsomega.1c04656 [doi]","epublish","ACS Omega. 2021 Dec 6;6(49):33652-33664. doi: 10.1021/acsomega.1c04656. eCollection 2021 Dec 14.","© 2021 The Authors.

Kidney histology helps diagnose DN and predict its outcomes, and an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach will maximize clinical utility of histopathological evaluation. Herein, we addressed whether AI-based integration of urine proteomics and image features improves DN classification and its outcome prediction, altogether augmenting and advancing pathology practice. METHODS: We studied whole slide images (WSIs) of periodic acid-Schiff-stained kidney biopsies from 56 DN patients with associated urinary proteomics data. We identified urinary proteins differentially expressed in patients who developed end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within two years of biopsy. Extending our previously published human-AI-loop pipeline, six renal sub-compartments were computationally segmented from each WSI. Hand-engineered image features for glomeruli and tubules, and urinary protein measurements, were used as inputs to deep-learning frameworks to predict ESKD outcome. Differential expression was correlated with digital image features using the Spearman rank sum coefficient. RESULTS: A total of 45 urinary proteins were differentially detected in progressors, which was most predictive of ESKD (AUC=0.95), while tubular and glomerular features were less predictive (AUC=0.71 and AUC=0.63, respectively). Accordingly, a correlation map between canonical cell-type proteins, such as epidermal growth factor and secreted phosphoprotein 1, and AI-based image features was obtained, which supports previous pathobiological results. CONCLUSIONS: Computational method-based integration of urinary and image biomarkers may improve the pathophysiological understanding of DN progression as well as carry clinical implications in histopathological evaluation.","Lucarelli, NicholasYun, DonghwanHan, DohyunGinley, BrandonMoon, Kyung ChulRosenberg, Avi ZTomaszewski, John EZee, JarcyJen, Kuang-YuHan, Seung SeokSarder, Pinaki","Lucarelli NYun DHan DGinley BMoon KCRosenberg AZTomaszewski JEZee JJen KYHan SSSarder P","J.

In order to identify novel and reliable protein markers for pre-diabetes in humans, healthy volunteers and patients diagnosed with pre-diabetes and stroke were recruited for blood collection. Blood samples were collected from healthy and pre-diabetic subjects 12 h after fasting. BMI was calculated from body weight and height. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (Hb(A1C)), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), insulin and albumin were assayed by automated clinical laboratory methods. We used a quantitative proteomics approach to identify 1074 proteins from the sera of pre-diabetic and healthy subjects. Among them, 500 proteins were then selected using Mascot analysis scores. Further, 70 out of 500 proteins were selected via volcano plot analysis according to their statistical significance and average relative protein ratio. Eventually, 7 serum proteins were singled out as candidate markers for pre-diabetes due to their diabetic relevance and statistical significance. Immunoblotting data demonstrated that laminin subunit alpha 2 (LAMA2), mixed-lineage leukemia 4 (MLL4), and plexin domain containing 2 (PLXDC2) were expressed in pre-diabetic patients but not healthy volunteers. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the combination of the three proteins has greater diagnostic efficacy than any individual protein. Thus, LAMA2, MLL4 and PLXDC2 are novel and reliable serum protein markers for pre-diabetic diagnosis in humans.","Yang, Meng-TingChang, Wei-HungKuo, Tien-FenShen, Ming-YiYang, Chu-WenTien, Yin-JingLai, Bun-YuehChen, Yet-RanChang, Yi-ChengYang, Wen-Chin","Yang MTChang WHKuo TFShen MYYang CWTien YJLai BYChen YRChang YCYang WC","Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.Department of Microbiology, Soochow University, Taipei, Taiwan.Institute for Information Industry, Taipei, Taiwan.Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.Graduate Institute of Medical Genomics and Proteomics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.Department of Institute of Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.Institute of Pharmacology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.Department of Aquaculture, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan.Biotechnology Center, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20210428","Switzerland","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Frontiers in endocrinology","101555782","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Cations)0 (Glycated Hemoglobin A)0 (Insulin)0 (Triglycerides)0 (hemoglobin A1c protein, human)97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)","IM","AdultAgedAged, 80 and overBiomarkers/*bloodBlood Glucose/analysisBody Mass IndexCationsCholesterol/metabolismChromatography, Ion ExchangeCombinatorial Chemistry TechniquesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/physiopathologyFemaleGlycated Hemoglobin/biosynthesisHumansInsulin/bloodInsulin ResistanceMaleMiddle AgedPrediabetic State/*bloodProteomicsSensitivity and SpecificityTriglycerides/metabolismYoung Adult","PMC8113970",NA,"NOTNLM","diagnosismarkerproteomicsserum proteintype 2 diabetes","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","2021/05/18 06:00","2021/12/22 06:00","2021/01/01","2021/05/17 06:03","2020/12/14 00:00 [received]2021/04/01 00:00 [accepted]2021/05/17 06:03 [entrez]2021/05/18 06:00 [pubmed]2021/12/22 06:00 [medline]2021/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.3389/fendo.2021.641336 [doi]","epublish","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2021 Apr 28;12:641336. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2021.641336. eCollection 2021.","Copyright © 2021 Yang, Chang, Kuo, Shen, Yang, Tien, Lai, Chen, Chang and Yang.",NA,NA,"10.3389/fendo.2021.641336",NA,2021

METHODS: Proteomics was performed on the interstitial fluid of subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained by microdialysis from 7 type 2 diabetes patients and 8 healthy participants. 851 proteins were detected, of which 36 (including galectin-1) showed significantly altered expression in type 2 diabetes. We also measured galectin-1 expression in: (1) adipocytes isolated from adipose tissue biopsies from these participants; (2) subcutaneous adipose tissue of 24 obese participants before, during and after 16weeks on a very low calorie diet (VLCD); and (3) adipocytes isolated from 6 healthy young participants after 4weeks on a diet and lifestyle intervention to promote weight gain. We also determined the effect of galectin-1 on glucose uptake in human adipose tissue. RESULTS: Galectin-1 protein levels were elevated in subcutaneous dialysates from type 2 diabetes compared with healthy controls (p<0.05). In agreement, galectin-1 mRNA expression was increased in adipocytes from the type 2 diabetes patients (p<0.05). Furthermore, galectin-1 mRNA expression was decreased in adipose tissue after VLCD (p<0.05) and increased by overfeeding (p<0.05). Co-incubation of isolated human adipocytes with galectin-1 reduced glucose uptake (p<0.05) but this was independent of the insulin signal. CONCLUSION: Proteomics of the interstitial fluid in subcutaneous adipose tissue in vivo identified a novel adipokine, galectin-1, with a potential role in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.","Fryk, EmanuelSundelin, Jeanna PermanStrindberg, LenaPereira, Maria JFederici, MassimoMarx, NikolausNyström, Fredrik HSchmelz, MartinSvensson, Per-ArneEriksson, Jan WBorén, JanJansson, Per-Anders","Fryk ESundelin JPStrindberg LPereira MJFederici MMarx NNyström FHSchmelz MSvensson PAEriksson JWBorén JJansson PA","Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Wallenberg Laboratory, Institute of Medicine, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.

High glucose reprograms DNA methylation patterns in various cell/tissue types, including ECs, resulting in pathologically relevant changes in cellular and extracellular proteome. However, DNA methylation-based proteome reprogramming in endothelial exosomes and associated pathological implications in T2D are not known. Hence, in the present study, we used Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), High Fat Diet (HFD) induced diabetic mice (C57BL/6) and clinical models to understand epigenetic basis of exosome proteome regulation in T2D pathogenesis . Exosomes were isolated by size exclusion chromatography and subjected to tandem mass tag (TMT) labelled quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics analysis. Immunoblotting was performed to validate exosome protein signature in clinically characterized individuals with T2D. We observed ECs cultured in high glucose and aortic ECs from HFD mouse expressed elevated DNA methyltransferase1 (DNMT1) levels. Quantitative proteomics of exosomes isolated from ECs treated with high glucose and overexpressing DNMT1 showed significant alterations in both protein levels and post translational modifications which were aligned to T2D associated vascular functions. Based on ontology and gene-function-disease interaction analysis, differentially expressed exosome proteins such as Thrombospondin1, Pentraxin3 and Cystatin C related to vascular complications were significantly increased in HUVECs treated with high glucose and HFD animals and T2D individuals with higher levels of glycated hemoglobin.

In the current study, we aimed to assess the role of thymosin β-4 (Tb-4) on endothelial function using dia-hiPSC-ECs as disease model of endothelial dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using dia-hiPSC-ECs as models of endothelial dysfunction, we determined the effect of Tb-4 on cell proliferation, senescence, cyto-protection, protein expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), secretion of endothelin-1 and MMP-1, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cyto-protection in vitro and angiogenic potential for treatment of ischemic limb disease in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in vivo. We found that 600 ng/mL Tb4 significantly up-regulated AKT activity and Bcl-XL protein expression, enhanced dia-hiPSC-EC viability and proliferation, limited senescence, reduced endothelin-1 and MMP-1 secretion, and improved reparative potency of dia-hiPSC-ECs for treatment of ischemic limb disease in mice with T2DM. However, Tb4 had no effect on improving mitochondrial membrane potential and glycine homeostasis and reducing intercellular adhesion molecule-1 protein expression in dia-hiPSC-ECs. CONCLUSIONS: Tb-4 improves endothelial dysfunction through enhancing hiPSC-EC viability, reducing senescence and endothelin-1 production, and improves angiogenic potency in diabetes.","Su, LipingKong, XiaocenLoo, SzejieGao, YuLiu, BingliSu, XiaofeiDalan, RinkooMa, JianhuaYe, Lei","Su LKong XLoo SGao YLiu BSu XDalan RMa JYe LAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5039-6224","National Heart Research Institute Singapore, National Heart Centre Singapore, Singapore, 169609, Singapore.Department of Endocrinology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.National Heart Research Institute Singapore, National Heart Centre Singapore, Singapore, 169609, Singapore.Department of Cardiology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200127, China.Department of Endocrinology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.Department of Endocrinology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.Department of Endocrinology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.Department of Endocrinology, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China. majianhua@china.com.National Heart Research Institute Singapore, National Heart Centre Singapore, Singapore, 169609, Singapore. yeleislp@yahoo.com.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20220110","England","Stem Cell Res Ther","Stem cell research & therapy","101527581","549LM7U24W (thymosin beta(4))61512-21-8 (Thymosin)","IM","AnimalsCell Differentiation/drug effects*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolismEndothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolismHumans*Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolismMice*Thymosin/genetics/pharmacology","PMC8751378",NA,"NOTNLM","Endothelial functionEndotheliumMitochondrial functionSenescenceThymosin","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","2022/01/12 06:00","2022/03/24 06:00","2022/01/10","2022/01/11 05:56","2021/10/14 00:00 [received]2021/12/17 00:00 [accepted]2022/01/11 05:56 [entrez]2022/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]2022/03/24 06:00 [medline]2022/01/10 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1186/s13287-021-02687-x [pii]2687 [pii]10.1186/s13287-021-02687-x [doi]","epublish","Stem Cell Res Ther. 2022 Jan 10;13(1):13. doi: 10.1186/s13287-021-02687-x.","© 2022.

AIMS: To better understand the association between T2DM and NAFLD, global changes in protein expression in diabetic and non-diabetic obese subjects were assessed by a proteomic approach. METHODS: Liver samples were obtained from diabetic and non-diabetic morbid obese subjects (BMI>40 kg/m(2) ). Histological analysis was used to evaluate hepatic steatosis and the degree of anatomopathological alteration. Changes in protein expression were analysed by two-dimentional electrophoresis combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Levels of glutathione, carbonyl and 4-HNE protein adducts were used to assess oxidative stress status. RESULTS: Of 850 proteins analysed, 33 were differentially expressed in T2DM obese subjects. Of these, 27 were unequivocally identified by mass spectrometry. Analysis of protein sets revealed patterns of decreased abundance in mitochondrial enzymes, proteins involved in methione metabolism, and oxidative stress response. Accordingly, T2DM subjects showed decreased levels of glutathione, the antioxidant byproduct of methionine metabolism via the transsulfuration pathway, and higher levels of protein and lipid oxidative damage. Changes in detoxyfing enzymes, carbohydrate metabolism, proteasome subunits and retinoic acid synthesis were also found. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest alterations in mitochondrial function and methionine metabolism as potential contributing factors to increased oxidative stress in liver of obese diabetic patients which may be influencing the development of NAFLD and NASH.","Valle, AdamoCatalán, VictoriaRodríguez, AmaiaRotellar, FernandoValentí, VictorSilva, CamiloSalvador, JavierFrühbeck, GmaGómez-Ambrosi, JavierRoca, PilarOliver, Jordi","Valle ACatalán VRodríguez ARotellar FValentí VSilva CSalvador JFrühbeck GGómez-Ambrosi JRoca POliver J","Grupo Multidisciplinar de Oncología Traslacional, Institut Universitari d'Investigació en Ciències de la Salut, Universitat de les Illes Balears, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20120219","United States","Liver Int","Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver","101160857","0 (Aldehydes)0 (Biomarkers)0 (Proteins)AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)K1CVM13F96 (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal)","IM","AdultAldehydes/analysisBiomarkers/analysisBiopsyDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications/metabolismElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-DimensionalFatty Liver/*etiology/metabolism/pathologyFemaleGlutathione/analysisHumansLiver/*chemistry/pathologyMethionine/analysisMiddle AgedMitochondria, Liver/chemistryNon-alcoholic Fatty Liver DiseaseObesity, Morbid/*complications/metabolismOxidative StressProtein CarbonylationProteins/*analysisProteomics/methodsSeverity of Illness IndexSpainSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2012/02/22 06:00","2012/10/12 06:00",NA,"2012/02/21 06:00","2011/10/19 00:00 [received]2012/01/15 00:00 [accepted]2012/02/21 06:00 [entrez]2012/02/22 06:00 [pubmed]2012/10/12 06:00 [medline]","10.1111/j.1478-3231.2012.02765.x [doi]","ppublish","Liver Int. 2012 Jul;32(6):951-61. doi: 10.1111/j.1478-3231.2012.02765.x.

The involvement of inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can affect the kidney and contribute to the development of diabetic kidney disease. Therefore we examined the association of urinary fetuin-A protein fragments with renal damage in T2DM patients. METHODS: Urinary peptides of 1491 individuals using proteome data available from the human urine proteome database were analysed. Prediction of proteases involved in urinary peptide generation was performed using the Proteasix tool. RESULTS: We identified 14 different urinary protein fragments that belong to the region of the connecting peptide (amino acid 301-339) of the total fetuin-A protein. Calpains (CAPN1 and CAPN2), matrix metalloproteinase and pepsin A-3 were identified as potential proteases that were partially confirmed by previous in vitro studies. Combined fetuin-A peptides (mean of amplitudes) were significantly increased in T2DM patients with kidney disease and to a lesser extent with cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, fetuin-A peptide levels displayed a significant negative correlation with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values (r = -0.316, P < 0.0001) and with the slope (%) of eGFR per year (r = -0.096, P = 0.023). A multiple regression model including fetuin-A peptide and albuminuria resulted in a significantly improved correlation with eGFR (r = -0.354, P < 0.0001) compared with albuminuria, indicating an added value of this novel biomarker. CONCLUSIONS: The urinary proteome analysis demonstrated the association of fetuin-A peptides with impaired kidney function in T2DM patients. Furthermore, fetuin-A peptides displayed early signs of kidney damage before albuminuria appeared and therefore can be used as markers for kidney disease detection.","Magalhães, PedroZürbig, PetraMischak, HaraldSchleicher, Erwin","Magalhães PZürbig PMischak HSchleicher E","Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH, Hannover, Germany.Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH, Hannover, Germany.Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH, Hannover, Germany.Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.Institute for Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry/Central Laboratory, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research, Tübingen; Germany.Institute for Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases, Helmholtz Centre Munich, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20201023","England","Clin Kidney J","Clinical kidney journal","101579321",NA,NA,NA,"PMC7857838",NA,"NOTNLM","biomarkersdiabetic kidney diseasefetuin-Aproteomicsurinary peptides",NA,"2021/02/11 06:00","2021/02/11 06:01","2020/10/23","2021/02/10 05:56","2020/06/01 00:00 [received]2020/07/09 00:00 [accepted]2021/02/10 05:56 [entrez]2021/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]2021/02/11 06:01 [medline]2020/10/23 00:00 [pmc-release]","sfaa176 [pii]10.1093/ckj/sfaa176 [doi]","epublish","Clin Kidney J. 2020 Oct 23;14(1):269-276. doi: 10.1093/ckj/sfaa176. eCollection 2021 Jan.","© The Author(s) 2020.

These novel predictive markers, however, are difficult to be widely used in clinical practice over the short term due to their high technology content, instability, and high cost. This study was aimed at evaluating the associations of clinical features and six traditional renal markers with the short-term risk of new-onset renal dysfunction in patients with T2D. METHODS: This study involved 213 participants with T2D and normal renal function at baseline. The baseline levels of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), alpha-1-microglobulin-to-creatinine ratio (A1MCR), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin-to-creatinine ratio, transferrin-to-creatinine ratio (UTRF/Cr), and retinol-binding protein-to-creatinine ratio (URBP/Cr) were analyzed. Multivariate logistic models were established and validated. RESULTS: During the two-year follow-up period, 23.01% participants progressed to renal dysfunction. The basal levels of ACR, A1MCR, UTRF/Cr, and URBP/Cr were the independent risk factors of new-onset renal dysfunction (P < 0.05). Several logistic models incorporating clinical characteristics and these renal markers were constructed for predicting the short-term risk of new-onset renal dysfunction. Comparatively, the model including age, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypertension, ACR, A1MCR, UTRF/Cr, and URBP/Cr levels at baseline had the highest potential (C  index = 0.785, P < 0.001). This model was validated using the K-fold cross-validation method; the accuracy was 0.815 ± 0.013 in training sets and 0.784 ± 0.019 in validation sets, indicating a good consistency for predicting the new-onset renal dysfunction risk. Finally, a nomogram based on this model was constructed to provide a quantitative tool to assess the individualized risk of short-term new-onset renal dysfunction. CONCLUSION: The model incorporating these markers and clinical features may have a high potential to predict the short-term risk of new-onset renal dysfunction.","Xu, JianboShan, XiaoyunXu, YinaMa, YongjunWang, Huabin","Xu JShan XXu YMa YAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9165-7371Wang HAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9090-7380","Department of Clinical Laboratory, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, China.Central Laboratory, Affiliated Jinhua Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleObservational Study","20220420","Egypt","J Immunol Res","Journal of immunology research","101627166","AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)","IM","Creatinine*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complicationsFemaleHumans*Kidney DiseasesLongitudinal StudiesMaleProteomics","PMC9045969",NA,NA,NA,"No authors declared any potential conflicts of interest.","2022/05/03 06:00","2022/05/04 06:00","2022/04/20","2022/05/02 07:05","2022/01/28 00:00 [received]2022/04/04 00:00 [accepted]2022/05/02 07:05 [entrez]2022/05/03 06:00 [pubmed]2022/05/04 06:00 [medline]2022/04/20 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1155/2022/6289261 [doi]","epublish","J Immunol Res. 2022 Apr 20;2022:6289261. doi: 10.1155/2022/6289261. eCollection 2022.","Copyright © 2022 Jianbo Xu et al.",NA,NA,"10.1155/2022/6289261",NA,2022

In the present study, we aimed to identify and biochemically characterize proteins associated with diabetes mellitus in a Qatari population. METHODS: In a diabetes case-control study (175 cases, 164 controls; Arab, South Asian and Philippine ethnicities), we conducted a discovery study to screen 1141 blood protein levels for associations with diabetes mellitus. Additional analyses were done in controls in relation to Hb1Ac, and biochemical characterization of the main findings was performed with metabolomics (501 metabolites). We performed two-sample Mendelian Randomization to provide evidence of potential causality using data from European descent of the DIAGRAM consortium (74,124 cases of diabetes mellitus and 824,006 controls) for the identified proteins for T2D and Hb1Ac. RESULTS: After accounting for multiple testing, 30 protein levels were different (p-values<8.6e(-5)) between cases and controls. Of these, a higher Hb1Ac in controls was associated with a lower IGFBP-2 level (p-value = 4.1e(-6)). IGFBP-2 protein level was found lower among cases compared with controls across all ethnicities. In controls, IGFBP-2 was associated with 21 metabolite levels, but specifically connected to the metabolite citrulline in network analyses. We observed no evidence, however, that the association between IGFBP-2 and diabetes mellitus was causal. CONCLUSIONS: We specifically identified IGFBP-2 to be associated with diabetes mellitus, although with no evidence for causality, which was specifically connected to citrulline metabolism.","Noordam, Raymondvan Heemst, DianaSuhre, KarstenKrumsiek, JanMook-Kanamori, Dennis O","Noordam Rvan Heemst DSuhre KKrumsiek JMook-Kanamori DO","Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands; Institute of Computational Biology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Neuherberg, Germany.

Exosomes emerge as carriers of biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring. This study aims to identify lipid metabolites in serum exosomes for T2DM diagnosis. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from newly diagnosed T2DM patients and age and body mass index-matched healthy controls. Exosomes were isolated using exosome isolation reagent, and untargeted/targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to identify and validate altered lipid metabolites. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of candidate lipid metabolites. RESULTS: Serum exosomes were successfully isolated from both groups, with untargeted LC-MS/MS revealing distinct lipid metabolite alterations. Notably, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (22:2(13Z,16Z)/14:0) showed stable elevation in T2DM-serum exosomes. Targeted LC-MS/MS confirmed significant increase of PE (22:2(13Z,16Z)/14:0) in T2DM exosomes but not in serum. PE (22:2(13Z,16Z)/14:0) levels not only positively correlated with hemoglobin A1C levels and blood glucose levels, but also effectively distinguished T2DM patients from healthy individuals (area under the curve = 0.9141). CONCLUSION: Our research sheds light on the importance of serum exosome lipid metabolites in diagnosing T2DM, providing valuable insights into the complex lipid metabolism of diabetes.","Zhang, LingLu, TingZhou, BaochengSun, YaoxiangWang, LiyunQiao, GuohongYang, Tingting","Zhang LLu TZhou BSun YWang LQiao GYang T","Department of Clinical Laboratory, Yixing People's Hospital, Yixing, China.Department of Endocrinology, Yixing People's Hospital, Yixing, China.Department of Medical Laboratory, Lianyungang Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Lianyungang, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, Yixing People's Hospital, Yixing, China.Department of Endocrinology, Yixing People's Hospital, Yixing, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, Yixing People's Hospital, Yixing, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, Yixing People's Hospital, Yixing, China.","eng","82202618/National Natural Science Youth Foundation of China/","Journal Article",NA,"England","Lab Med","Laboratory medicine","0250641","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Lipids)39382-08-6 (phosphatidylethanolamine)","IM","*Lipidomics/methods*Exosomes/metabolism/ultrastructure*Biomarkers/blood*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/diagnosisHumansMaleFemaleMiddle AgedCase-Control Studies*Lipids/bloodReproducibility of Results",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","LC-MS/MSdiagnosisexosomeslipidomicsserumtype 2 diabetes mellitus",NA,"2024/05/29 18:43","2024/11/04 12:25",NA,"2024/05/29 12:43","2024/11/04 12:25 [medline]2024/05/29 18:43 [pubmed]2024/05/29 12:43 [entrez]","7684924 [pii]10.1093/labmed/lmae039 [doi]","ppublish","Lab Med. 2024 Nov 4;55(6):724-731. doi: 10.1093/labmed/lmae039.","© The Author(s) 2024.

METHODS: Participants were diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and had PWV and/or pulse wave analysis performed. Dietary intake was measured using the Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies Version 2 Food Frequency Questionnaire. Serum lipid species and carotenoids were measured, using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography, as biomarkers of dairy and vegetable intake, respectively. Associations were determined using linear regression adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: PWV (n = 95) was inversely associated with reduced fat dairy intake (β = -0.01; 95% CI -0.02, -0.01; p = 0 < 0.05) in particular yoghurt consumption (β = -0.04; 95% CI -0.09, -0.01; p = 0 < 0.05) after multivariate adjustment. Total vegetable consumption was negatively associated with PWV in the whole cohort after full adjustment (β = -0.04; 95% CI -0.07, -0.01; p < 0.05). Individual lipid species, particularly those containing 14:0, 15:0, 16:0, 17:0 and 17:1 fatty acids, known to be of ruminant origin, in lysophosphatidylcholine, cholesterol ester, diacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and triacylglycerol classes were positively associated with intake of full fat dairy, after adjustment for multiple comparisons. However, there was no association between serum lipid species and PWV. There were no dietary predictors of central blood pressure or augmentation index after multivariate adjustment. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of subjects with diabetes reduced fat dairy intake and vegetable consumption were inversely associated with PWV. The lack of a relationship between serum lipid species and PWV suggests that the fatty acid composition of dairy may not explain the beneficial effect.","Petersen, K SKeogh, J BMeikle, P JGarg, M LClifton, P M","Petersen KSKeogh JBMeikle PJGarg MLClifton PM","School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences & Sansom Institute for Health Research, University of South Australia, GPO Box 2471, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.

Ninety-six peptides corresponding to 52 proteins were differentially expressed between the diabetic edentulous patients and controls (p < 0.05). Some diabetes-related inflammatory biomarkers including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and serum amyloid A were detected with levels increased in diabetic samples. Other biomarkers including amylase, palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated protein (PLUNC), and serotransferrin levels were decreased in diabetic samples. In contrast with previous findings, salivary carbonic anhydrase 6 and alpha-2 macroglobulin levels, however, were decreased in this diabetic patient population. Cluster analysis and principle component analysis demonstrated a differential pattern of protein biomarker expression between diabetic and control subjects. Western blot analysis was completed to confirm the relatively lower expression level of two biomarkers, including PLUNC and amylase in the diabetic group compared to control subjects. The presence of salivary biomarkers specific for diabetes in edentulous subjects mimics those in serum, especially those related to inflammatory/lipid metabolism. While this exploratory study requires further validation with a larger population, it provides proof-of-principle for salivary proteomics for edentulous subjects with diabetes.","Border, Michael BSchwartz, SarahCarlson, JimDibble, Christopher FKohltfarber, HeidiOffenbacher, StevenBuse, John BBencharit, Sompop","Border MBSchwartz SCarlson JDibble CFKohltfarber HOffenbacher SBuse JBBencharit S","Department of Prosthodontics, School of Dentistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7450, USA.","eng","HL092338/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesUL1RR025747/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20120208","England","Mol Biosyst","Molecular bioSystems","101251620","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Proteome)0 (Serum Amyloid A Protein)EC 4.2.1.1 (Carbonic Anhydrases)EC 4.2.1.1 (carbonic anhydrase VI)","IM","AgedBiomarkers/analysisBlotting, WesternCarbonic Anhydrases/analysisChromatography, Liquid/methodsCluster AnalysisDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/metabolism/*physiopathologyFemaleHumansMaleMiddle AgedMouth, Edentulous/complications/*metabolismProteome/*analysisProteomics/*methodsSaliva/*chemistrySerum Amyloid A Protein/analysisTandem Mass Spectrometry/methods",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2012/02/09 06:00","2012/06/30 06:00",NA,"2012/02/09 06:00","2012/02/09 06:00 [entrez]2012/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]2012/06/30 06:00 [medline]","10.1039/c2mb05079j [doi]","ppublish","Mol Biosyst. 2012 Apr;8(4):1304-10. doi: 10.1039/c2mb05079j.

However, the molecular basis of adipocyte differentiation and its regulation remains obscure. Therefore, we exposed 3T3-L1 cell line to appropriate hormonal inducers as adipocyte differentiation model. Using iTRAQ-coupled 2D LC-MS/MS, a successfully exploited high-throughput proteomic technology, we nearly quantitated 1,000 protein species and found 106 significantly altered proteins during adipocyte differentiation. The great majority of differentially expressed proteins were related to metabolism enzymes, structural molecules, and proteins involved in signal transduction. In addition to previously reported differentially expressed molecules, more than 20 altered proteins previously unknown to be involved with adipogenic process were firstly revealed (e.g., HEXB, DPP7, PTTG1IP, PRDX5, EPDR1, SPNB2, STEAP3, TPP1, etc.). The partially differential proteins were verified by Western blot and/or real-time PCR analysis.

To date, the molecular mechanisms of DN remain largely unclear. The present study aimed to identify and characterize novel proteins involved in the development of DN by a proteomic approach. Proteomic analysis revealed that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase 2 (HMGCS2), the key enzyme in ketogenesis, was increased fourfold in the kidneys of type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Consistently, the activity of HMGCS2 in kidneys and 24-h urinary excretion of the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) were significantly increased in db/db mice. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and real-time PCR studies further demonstrated that HMGCS2 was highly expressed in renal glomeruli of db/db mice, with weak expression in the kidneys of control mice. Because filtered ketone bodies are mainly reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, we used RPTC cells, a rat proximal tubule cell line, to examine the effect of the increased level of ketone bodies. Treating cultured RPTC cells with 1 mM β-HB significantly induced transforming growth factor-β1 expression, with a marked increase in collagen I expression. β-HB treatment also resulted in a marked increase in vimentin protein expression and a significant reduction in E-cadherin protein levels, suggesting an enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in RPTCs. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that diabetic kidneys exhibit excess ketogenic activity resulting from increased HMGCS2 expression. Enhanced ketone body production in the diabetic kidney may represent a novel mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of DN.","Zhang, DongjuanYang, HangKong, XiaomuWang, KangMao, XuanYan, XianzhongWang, YuanLiu, SiqiZhang, XiaoyanLi, JingChen, LihongWu, JingWei, MingfenYang, JichunGuan, Youfei","Zhang DYang HKong XWang KMao XYan XWang YLiu SZhang XLi JChen LWu JWei MYang JGuan Y","Dept. of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Peking University Health Science Ctr., Haidian District, Beijing, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20101019","United States","Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab","American journal of physiology.

We hypothesized that specific plasma 1-deoxysphingolipids associate with DN severity, and that alterations in plasma serine and alanine associate with 1-deoxysphingolipid elevation in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We examined individual 1-deoxysphingolipid species using LC/MS/MS in plasma samples from 75 individuals including lean controls (LC, n = 19), those with obesity (n = 19), obesity with T2D without DN (ob/T2D, n = 18), and obesity with T2D with DN (Ob/T2D/DN, n = 19).

Mean total concentrations of 1-deoxydihydroceramides, and most individual 1-deoxydihydroceramide species, were higher in ob/T2D/DN versus LC group (8.939 vs. 5.195 pmol/100 μL for total 1-deoxydihydroceramides p = 0.005).

The metabolomic analysis revealed alterations in the levels of 7 metabolites derived from glycolysis, the TCA cycle and pentose phosphate shunt, and 4 amino acids. Principal component analysis of the metabolite data showed two clusters, corresponding to the cells cultured at 2.8 and 16.7 mM glucose, respectively. Concurrent changes in protein expression were analyzed by 2-D gel electrophoresis followed by LC-MS/MS. The identities of 86 spots corresponding to 75 unique proteins that were significantly different in 832/13 beta-cells cultured at 16.7 mM glucose were established. Only 5 of these were found to be metabolic enzymes that could be involved in the metabolomic alterations observed. Anticipated changes in metabolite levels in cells exposed to increased glucose were observed, while changes in enzyme levels were much less profound.

AIM: The aim of this study is to analyze the systemic effect of PDE5 inhibition in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) determining changes in the expression levels of plasma proteins. METHODS: Seventeen patients with controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and ED were included in the study. Patients received vardenafil hydrochloride 20 mg on demand during 12 weeks. At the beginning and 12 weeks after vardenafil administration, plasma samples were collected and analyzed using proteomics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function Domain (IIEF-EFD) and plasma protein expression before and after vardenafil administration. Nitrate/nitrite release, PDE5, and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) expression and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs). RESULTS: The IIEF-EFD score was markedly improved after 12 weeks of vardenafil administration. Plasma levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin isotypes 4 and 6 and β-tropomyosin were decreased, whereas apolipoprotein AI isoype 5 was increased 12 weeks after vardenafil administration. Only β-tropomyosin plasma levels were inversely correlated with IIEF-EFD score. Tropomyosin has been added to cultured BAECs and after 24 hours reduced the protein expression level of sGC-β1 subunit and decreased the cGMP content. Tropomyosin did not modify PDE5 expression and nitric oxide release in BAECs as compared with control BAECs. Vardenafil (10 μg/mL) did not modify sGC-β1 subunit expression in tropomyosin + vardenafil-incubated BAECs; however, vardenafil significantly reversed the reduction of cGMP content induced by tropomyosin. CONCLUSION: Vardenafil administration improved erectile functionality in controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with ED, which was associated with reduction of circulating plasma β-tropomyosin levels. Tropomyosin affected by itself the cGMP generating system suggesting a possible new mechanism involved in ED. Vardenafil reversed the reduction effect of cGMP content elicited by tropomyosin in BAECs.","Zamorano-León, Jose JOlivier, Carlosde Las Heras, NataliaMateos-Cáceres, Petra JBrime Menéndez, RicardoRodríguez-Sierra, PabloMartín Palacios, NaiharaManso, Luis San JoséModrego, JavierSegura, AntonioMacaya, CarlosLópez-Farré, Antonio J","Zamorano-León JJOlivier Cde Las Heras NMateos-Cáceres PJBrime Menéndez RRodríguez-Sierra PMartín Palacios NManso LSModrego JSegura AMacaya CLópez-Farré AJ","Cardiovascular Research Unit, Cardiology Department of Hospital Clínico San Carlos de Madrid, Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria del Hospital Clínico San Carlos (IdISSC), Madrid, Spain.","eng",NA,"Clinical TrialJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20130924","Netherlands","J Sex Med","The journal of sexual medicine","101230693","0 (Imidazoles)0 (Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors)0 (Piperazines)0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)0 (Sulfones)0 (Triazines)0 (Tropomyosin)31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)5O8R96XMH7 (Vardenafil Dihydrochloride)EC 3.1.4.

In this study, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were used to explore the molecular mechanism of E. ulmoides counteracts F. oxysporum infection. Transcriptomic analysis at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after inoculation identified 17, 591, 1,205, and 625 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), while proteomics identified were 66, 138, 148, 234 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Meanwhile, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of the DEGs and DEPs showed that they were mainly associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER), fructose and mannose metabolism, protein processing in the ER, type II diabetes mellitus, the ribosome, antigen processing and presentation, and the phagosome. In addition, proteome and transcriptome association analysis and RT-qPCR showed that the response of E. ulmoides to F. oxysporum was likely related to the unfolded protein response (UPR) of the ER pathway.

Abundant flavonoids are the antidiabetic components of Radix scutellariae, of which baicalin (Baicalein 7-O-glucuronide, BG) is the major bioactive component. Our previous studies found that the water extract of Radix scutellariae (WESB) could exert hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic efficacies by adjusting the ileum FXR-medicated interaction between gut microbiota and bile acid (BA) metabolism. However, it remains unclear whether WESB and its biologically active ingredients exert an antidiabetic effect through bile acid signaling mediated by FXR-CYP7A1. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To explore the mechanism of WESB and its total flavonoids (TF) further and BG on BA signals and glycolipid metabolism in T2DM mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antidiabetic effects of WESB, TF and BG were evaluated by indexing the body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in HFD/STZ-induced (high-fat diet and streptozocin) diabetic mice, and comparing them with the positive control (metformin). The lipids in the mouse liver and the total bile acids (TBA) in the mouse liver and bile were detected by commercial kits. The concentration of BAs in the mouse feces was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The protein expression levels of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), farnesol X receptor (FXR), etc., in the liver and/or ileum, play a key role in the BAs metabolism of T2DM mice were evaluated by immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: The hyperglycemia and impaired glucose tolerance of T2DM mice were improved after WESB, TF and BG treatment. Especially after BG administration, the levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) and total glyceride (TG) in the T2DM mouse liver were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). While the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) was significant increased (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, the levels of TBA in both the liver and bile of T2DM mice were significantly decreased by BG (p < 0.05). Moreover, the high expression of CYP7A1 in the liver of T2DM mice was significantly inhibited by WESB, TF and BG (p < 0.05), and the high expression of FXR in the ileum of T2DM mice was significantly inhibited by TF (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results indicated that the hypoglycemic effects of WESB, TF and BG might be exerted by inhibiting the expression of CYP7A1 in T2DM mice, and TF inhibited expression of intestinal FXR by inducing changes in fecal BA profile. BG significantly improved hepatic lipid metabolism. Moreover, BG reduced lipid accumulation in the liver and bile by inhibiting the expression of CYP7A1 in T2DM mice. These findings provide useful explanations for the antidiabetic mechanism of Radix scutellariae.","Yan, XiumeiZhang, YulongPeng, YingLi, Xiaobo","Yan XZhang YPeng YLi X","School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No. 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang District, Shanghai, 200240, China.School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No. 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang District, Shanghai, 200240, China.School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No. 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang District, Shanghai, 200240, China.School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No. 800 Dongchuan Road, Minhang District, Shanghai, 200240, China.

Metabolomics provides substantial insights into the biological understanding of environmental factors such as diet. This study aimed to identify metabolomic markers of regression to normoglycemia in the context of a lifestyle intervention (LSI) in individuals with prediabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a single-arm intervention study with 24 weeks of follow-up. Eligible study participants had at least one prediabetes criteria according to the American Diabetes Association guidelines, and body mass index between 25 and 45 kg/m(2). LSI refers to a hypocaloric diet and >150 min of physical activity per week. Regression to normoglycemia (RNGR) was defined as achieving hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <5.5% in the final visit. Baseline and postintervention plasma metabolomic profiles were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. To select metabolites associated with RNGR, we conducted the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-penalized regressions. RESULTS: The final sample was composed of 82 study participants. Changes in three metabolites were significantly associated with regression to normoglycemia; N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (OR=0.54; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.82), putrescine (OR=0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98), and 7-methylguanine (OR=1.06; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17), independent of HbA1c and weight loss. In addition, metabolomic perturbations due to LSI displayed enrichment of taurine and hypotaurine metabolism pathway (p=0.03) compatible with biomarkers of protein consumption, lower red meat and animal fats and higher seafood and vegetables. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this study suggests that specific metabolomic markers have an influence on glucose regulation in individuals with prediabetes after 24 weeks of LSI independently of other treatment effects such as weight loss.","Sevilla-Gonzalez, Magdalena Del RocioManning, Alisa KWesterman, Kenneth EAguilar-Salinas, Carlos AlbertoDeik, AmyClish, Clary B","Sevilla-Gonzalez MDRAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6135-9998Manning AKAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-0247-902XWesterman KEAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-7619-1868Aguilar-Salinas CAAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8517-0241Deik AAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9687-0953Clish CBAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8259-9245","Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA msevillagonzalez@mgh.harvard.edu.Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.Metabolism Program, The Broad Insitute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.Unidad de Investigacion en Enfermedades Metabólicas, Insituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, México City, México City, Mexico.Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.Metabolism Program, The Broad Insitute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.Metabolism Program, The Broad Insitute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.Unidad de Investigacion en Enfermedades Metabólicas, Insituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, México City, México City, Mexico.Metabolomics Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.Metabolomics Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"England","BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care","BMJ open diabetes research & care","101641391","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Dietary Proteins)0 (Glycated Hemoglobin A)1EQV5MLY3D (Taurine)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)KM15WK8O5T (Acetylgalactosamine)V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)","IM","AcetylgalactosamineBiomarkers*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/prevention & controlDiet, ReducingDietary Proteins/analysisGlucoseGlycated Hemoglobin/analysisHumansMetabolomicsObesity/complications*Prediabetic StatePutrescineTaurineWeight Loss","PMC9577902",NA,"NOTNLM","biomarkerslife styleprediabetic state","Competing interests: None declared.","2022/10/18 06:00","2022/10/20 06:00","2022/10/17","2022/10/17 20:52","2022/06/27 00:00 [received]2022/09/16 00:00 [accepted]2022/10/17 20:52 [entrez]2022/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]2022/10/20 06:00 [medline]2022/10/17 00:00 [pmc-release]","10/5/e003010 [pii]bmjdrc-2022-003010 [pii]10.1136/bmjdrc-2022-003010 [doi]","ppublish","BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care. 2022 Oct;10(5):e003010. doi: 10.1136/bmjdrc-2022-003010.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis and prevention of T2D has sparked widespread interest. Vitamin D plays a classical role in Ca++ homeostasis as well as regulates insulin secretion from β-cells and its action on various target cells. Proteins are the vital components of all cellular processes and their expression alters in response to various external or internal stimuli. Alteration in protein structure, function may contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases including diabetes. Protein expression during the exposure of the cells to different glucose concentrations may alter and can give vital information about the pathogenesis of T2D. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of different glucose concentrations and supplementation of vitamin D on proteomic profile of L6 cell lines. METHOD: L6 skeletal muscle cells were exposed to different Glucose (G) concentrations (0mM, 8mM, 16mM and 25mM) supplemented with Vitamin D (VD) for 48 hours. Total cell protein was extracted and protein profile was studied using SDS-PAGE. Three distinct bands observed in SDSPAGE in samples obtained from cells which were exposed to 8mM (G), 8mM (G) + VD and 16mM (G). The distinct bands were excised, in gel digestion were performed and MALDI-TOF analysis of the samples were done. RESULTS: MALDI-TOF analysis revealed these bands as mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3 MOUSE), Insulin gene enhancer protein 2 (ISL2 MOUSE) and Tubulin polyglutamylase complex1 (TPGS1 MOUSE) respectively. UCP3 protein is primarily expressed in the skeletal muscle cells and is involved in energy homeostasis and modulates insulin sensitivity. ISL2 protein plays an important role in differentiation and maintenance of the tissues. TPGS1 helps in microtubule polymerization might be helping in glucose transport and also play crucial role in the cellular movement, organization of intracellular structure, and intracellular transport. CONCLUSION: These identified proteins may provide information about disease pathophysiology and can serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention of T2D. Further studies on the changes of protein expression under high glucose concentration and supplementation with vitamin D will lead to better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of T2D.","Taneja, NancyPriyadarshini","Taneja NPriyadarshini","Department of Biotechnology, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India.Department of Biotechnology, Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India.","eng",NA,"Journal Article",NA,"Netherlands","Protein Pept Lett","Protein and peptide letters","9441434","0 (Glucose Transport Proteins, Facilitative)0 (Isl2 protein, mouse)0 (LIM-Homeodomain Proteins)0 (Proteome)0 (Transcription Factors)0 (Ucp3 protein, mouse)0 (Uncoupling Protein 3)1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)EC 6.3.2.

Proteomic methods such as 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis have been used to gain insight into glomerular and tubular nephropathies including DN. At the protein level, differences in high-abundant proteins in DN have been shown to reflect primarily differentially posttranslationally modified plasma proteins. Higher-sensitivity proteomic methods (eg, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) have pushed the boundaries on the known urinary proteome to include more than 1,500 proteins. These same high-sensitivity methods have been applied toward profiling urinary peptides, which has resulted in methods to diagnostically screen urine to differentiate between type-2 diabetes mellitus and type-1 diabetes mellitus urine, normal versus microalbuminuria, or by angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment. Proteomic methods are being used to show response to insulin gene therapy in an animal model or alterations in the renal cortex mitochondrial proteome with the development of the diabetic phenotype. Proteomic methods continue to aid in the discovery of new mechanisms of diabetic pathology and understanding of the etiology of diabetic complications.","Merchant, Michael LKlein, Jon B","Merchant MLKlein JB","Kidney Disease Program, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. nlmerc02@louisville.edu","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleReview",NA,"United States","Semin Nephrol","Seminars in nephrology","8110298",NA,"IM","AnimalsDiabetic Nephropathies/*metabolismDisease Models, AnimalElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-DimensionalHumansKidney/chemistryProteinuria/diagnosisProteomics/*methodsSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-IonizationRF   35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2007/12/07 09:00","2008/02/19 09:00",NA,"2007/12/07 09:00","2007/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]2008/02/19 09:00 [medline]2007/12/07 09:00 [entrez]","S0270-9295(07)00126-X [pii]10.1016/j.semnephrol.2007.09.003 [doi]","ppublish","Semin Nephrol. 2007 Nov;27(6):627-36. doi: 10.1016/j.semnephrol.2007.09.003.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2007

T2D results from the impaired secretion or action of the insulin with a clinical phenotype of persistent hyperglycemia in the uncontrolled subjects. The disease clinical features appear after several years of latent preclinical asymptomatic conditions. Thus, when the disease is full blown, there are limited chances to reverse the disease phenotype; however, it can be managed by controlling diet, changing life style and using medicines. Understanding pathological mechanisms whereby genetic and/or environmental factors contribute to the development of diabetes is important for the prevention and treatment of the disease. In this regard, approaches such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics are being applied to identify more specific biomarkers for T2D for its early detection, management and devising new therapies. The emphasis of the present review is to provide updates on the applications of proteomics in addressing T2D with a focus on protein based biomarker discovery. Moreover, the idea of personalized medicine and intervention is also discussed for diabetes treatment in proteomics perspective.","Khan, Abdul RehmanAwan, Fazli Rabbi","Khan ARAwan FR","National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Faisalabad, Pakistan. huzaifa_khn@yahoo.com","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tReview",NA,"Pakistan","Pak J Pharm Sci","Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences","9426356","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Proteins)0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)","IM","AnimalsBiomarkers/*bloodBlood Proteins/*analysis*Data MiningDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapyDrug DesignHumansHypoglycemic Agents/therapeutic usePrognosisProteomics/methods",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2012/09/27 06:00","2012/12/12 06:00",NA,"2012/09/27 06:00","2012/09/27 06:00 [entrez]2012/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]2012/12/12 06:00 [medline]",NA,"ppublish","Pak J Pharm Sci. 2012 Oct;25(4):889-901.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2012

Serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) decreases with an increase in blood sugar >180 mg/dl. We hypothesized that salivary 1,5-AG can be used to identify blood sugar higher than 180 mg/dl using a novel biochemical method. AIM: This study aimed to develop a novel biochemical method for serum and salivary assessment of 1,5-AG and assess its correlation with postprandial blood sugar (PPBS) >180 mg/dl. METHODOLOGY: The study comprised 45 controls (healthy individuals) and 45 cases (type 2 diabetic patients with PPBS >180 mg/dl). Blood and salivary samples were collected according to the study protocol. A new method was developed for the quantification of 1,5-AG in serum and saliva using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The value of serum (mean -22.19 μg/ml and median -22.12 μg/ml) and salivary (mean -0.124 μg/ml and median -0.088 μg/ml) 1,5-AG was higher in healthy individuals compared to corresponding serum (mean -3.89 μg/ml and median -2.52 μg/ml) and salivary (mean -0.025 μg/ml and median  0.025 μg/ml) levels in diabetics with PPBS >180 mg/dl. In diabetics, a significant negative correlation was noticed with PPBS levels and 1,5-AG levels in serum and saliva. Salivary 1,5-AG level <0.054 μg/ml had an 86.4% sensitivity and 87.2% specificity in predicting a blood sugar value >180 mg/dl. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that the short-term glycemic marker 1,5-AG can be detected in saliva and can be useful as an adjunct marker in monitoring of glycemic status in diabetic patients.","Kedarnath, Priyadarshini SubramaniamSubramanian, S SathasivaBhaskar, EmmanuelKasi, MohanPillai, VinodSubramanian, SaravananManohar, Venkat","Kedarnath PSSubramanian SSBhaskar EKasi MPillai VSubramanian SManohar V","Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Dhanalakshmi Srinivasan Dental College, Perambalur, Tamil Nadu, India.Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Sri Ramachandra Dental College and Hospital, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.Department of General Medicine, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.Indian Institute of Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.Indian Institute of Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.Indian Institute of Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.Indian Institute of Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20230327","India","Int J Appl Basic Med Res","International journal of applied & basic medical research","101579831",NA,NA,NA,"PMC10230528",NA,"NOTNLM","Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometrysalivary 1,5-anhydroglucitolsalivary biomarkershort-term glycemic markertandem mass spectrometrytype II diabetes mellitus","There are no conflicts of interest.","2023/06/02 13:15","2023/06/02 13:16","2023/01/01","2023/06/02 11:00","2022/06/26 00:00 [received]2022/12/06 00:00 [revised]2023/01/10 00:00 [accepted]2023/06/02 13:16 [medline]2023/06/02 13:15 [pubmed]2023/06/02 11:00 [entrez]2023/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","IJABMR-13-23 [pii]10.4103/ijabmr.ijabmr_378_22 [doi]","ppublish","Int J Appl Basic Med Res. 2023 Jan-Mar;13(1):23-28. doi: 10.4103/ijabmr.ijabmr_378_22.

METHODS: A total of 80 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal (NG, n = 20) and type 2 diabetes mellitus groups (T2DM, n = 60) and subdivided into three groups according to the duration of diabetes: T2DM-4w, T2DM-12w, and T2DM-24w groups; the duration was calculated from the time point of T2DM rat model establishment. The three comparison groups were set up in this study, T2DM-4w group vs. NG, T2DM-12w group vs. T2DM-4w group, and T2DM-24w group vs. T2DM-12w group. The metabolite profiles of supraspinatus tendon were obtained using tandem mass spectrometry. Metabolomics multivariate statistics were used for metabolic data analysis and differential metabolite (DEM) determination. The intersection of the three comparison groups' DEMs was defined as key metabolites that changed consistently in the supraspinatus tendon after diabetes induction; then, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was performed. RESULTS: T2DM-4w group vs. NG, T2DM-12w group vs. T2DM-4w group, and T2DM-24w group vs. T2DM-12w group detected 94 (86 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated), 36 (13 up-regulated and 23 down-regulated) and 86 (24 up-regulated and 62 down-regulated) DEMs, respectively. Seven key metabolites of sustained changes in the supraspinatus tendon following induction of diabetes include D-Lactic acid, xanthine, O-acetyl-L-carnitine, isoleucylproline, propoxycarbazone, uric acid, and cytidine, which are the first identified biomarkers of the supraspinatus tendon as it progresses through the course of diabetes. The results of KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the main pathway of supraspinatus metabolism affected by diabetes (p < 0.05) was purine metabolism. The results of the KEGG metabolic pathway vs. DEMs correlation network graph revealed that uric acid and xanthine play a role in more metabolic pathways. CONCLUSION: Untargeted metabolomics revealed the dynamic changes of metabolite composition in rat supraspinatus tendons at different stages of diabetes, and the newly discovered seven metabolites, especially uric acid and xanthine, may provide novel research to elucidate the mechanism of diabetes-induced tendinopathy.","Xu, KuishuaiZhang, LiangWang, TianruiRen, ZhongkaiYu, TengboZhang, YingzeZhao, Xia","Xu KZhang LWang TRen ZYu TZhang YZhao X","Department of Sports Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.Department of Sports Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.Department of Sports Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.Department of Sports Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.Department of Sports Medicine, Qingdao Municipal Hospital, Qingdao, Shandong, China.Department of Sports Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.Department of Sports Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.","eng",NA,"CommentJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20231120","Switzerland","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Frontiers in endocrinology","101555782","268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)","IMCON  J Orthop Res. 2022 Apr;40(4):965-976. doi: 10.1002/jor.25112.

The aim of this study was to characterize the profile of amino acids and acylcarnitines in COVID-19 patients. A multicenter, cross-sectional study was carried out. A total of 453 individuals were classified by disease severity. Levels of 11 amino acids, 31 acylcarnitines, and succinylacetone in serum samples were analyzed by electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Different clusters were observed in partial least squares discriminant analysis, with phenylalanine, alanine, citrulline, proline, and succinylacetone providing the major contribution to the variability in each cluster (variable importance in the projection &gt;1.5). In logistic models adjusted by age, sex, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and nutritional status, phenylalanine was associated with critical outcomes (odds ratio=5.3 (95% CI 3.16-9.2) in the severe vs. critical model, with an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.77-0.90). In conclusion the metabolic imbalance in COVID-19 patients might affect disease progression. This work shows an association of phenylalanine with critical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, highlighting phenylalanine as a potential metabolic biomarker of disease severity.","Martínez-Gómez, Laura EIbarra-González, IsabelFernández-Lainez, CynthiaTusie, TeresaMoreno-Macías, HortensiaMartinez-Armenta, CarlosJimenez-Gutierrez, Guadalupe ElizabethVázquez-Cárdenas, PaolaVidal-Vázquez, PatriciaRamírez-Hinojosa, Juan PRodríguez-Zulueta, Ana PVargas-Alarcón, GilbertoRojas-Velasco, GustavoSánchez-Muñoz, FaustoPosadas-Sanchez, RosalindaMartínez-Ruiz, Felipe de JZayago-Angeles, Dulce MMoreno, Mariana LBarajas-Galicia, EdithLopez-Cisneros, GerardoGonzalez-Fernández, Nadia COrtega-Peña, SilvestreHerrera-López, BrígidaOlea-Torres, JesselJuárez-Arias, ManuelRosas-Vásquez, MaritzaCabrera-Nieto, Sara AileenMagaña, Jonathan JCamacho-Rea, María Del CarmenSuarez-Ahedo, CarlosCoronado-Zarco, IrmaValdespino-Vázquez, M YMartínez-Nava, Gabriela AngélicaPineda, CarlosVela-Amieva, MarcelaLópez-Reyes, Alberto","Martínez-Gómez LEIbarra-González IFernández-Lainez CTusie TMoreno-Macías HMartinez-Armenta CJimenez-Gutierrez GEVázquez-Cárdenas PVidal-Vázquez PRamírez-Hinojosa JPRodríguez-Zulueta APVargas-Alarcón GRojas-Velasco GSánchez-Muñoz FPosadas-Sanchez RMartínez-Ruiz FJZayago-Angeles DMMoreno MLBarajas-Galicia ELopez-Cisneros GGonzalez-Fernández NCOrtega-Peña SHerrera-López BOlea-Torres JJuárez-Arias MRosas-Vásquez MCabrera-Nieto SAMagaña JJCamacho-Rea MDCSuarez-Ahedo CCoronado-Zarco IValdespino-Vázquez MYMartínez-Nava GAPineda CVela-Amieva MLópez-Reyes A","Laboratorio de Gerociencias, Laboratorio Facilitador, Laboratorio de Medicina Genómica, Dirección General, Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitación Luis Guillermo Ibarra Ibarra, Secretaría de Salud, Ciudad de México, Mexico.Unidad de Genética de la Nutrición, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), Ciudad de México, Mexico.Laboratorio de Errores Innatos del Metabolismo y Tamiz, Instituto Nacional de Pediatría, Secretaría de Salud, Ciudad de México, Mexico.Unidad de Biología Molecular y Medicina Genómica, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas UNAM, Ciudad de México, Mexico.Unidad de Biología Molecular y Medicina Genómica, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas UNAM, Ciudad de México, Mexico.Departamento de Economía.

Therefore, risk assessment is important for treatment and shared decisions. We used data from EXAMINE trial to investigate whether a multi-proteomic approach would provide specific proteomic signatures and also improve the prognostic capacity for determining the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, heart failure [HF], all-cause death, and combinations of these outcomes. METHODS: 93 circulating proteins (92 from the Olink® CVDII plus troponin) were assessed in 5131 patients. Cox, competing risks, and reclassification measures were applied. RESULTS: The clinical model showed good discrimination and calibration for all outcomes. On top of the clinical model that included age, sex, smoking, diabetes duration, history of MI (prior to the index MI of inclusion), history of HF hospitalization, history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, statin therapy, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and study treatment (alogliptin or placebo), troponin and BNP added prognostic information to the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (∆C-index + 5%) and cardiovascular death alone (∆C-index + 7%). Troponin, BNP, and TRAILR2 added prognostic information on all-cause death and the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization. HF hospitalization alone was improved by adding BNP and Gal-9. For MI, troponin, FGF23, and AMBP added prognostic value; whereas for stroke, only troponin added prognostic value (multi-proteomics improved C-index > 3% [p < 0.001] for all the studied outcomes). The addition of the final biomarker selection to the clinical model improved event reclassification (cNRI from + 23% to + 64%). Specifically, the addition of the biomarkers allowed a better classification of patients at low risk (as having ""true"" low risk) and patients and high risk (as having ""true"" high risk). These results were consistent for all the studied outcomes with even more marked differences in the fatal events.

Twenty proteins were differentially expressed in db/db mouse sera in the first experiment and eight proteins were differentially expressed in db/db mouse sera after liraglutide treatment in the second experiment. Soluble epidermal growth factor receptor (sEGFR) was identified as a common factor, and its protein level was significantly affected in both experiments. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed that the relatively low serum sEGFR levels in db/db mice were restored by liraglutide treatment. The serum sEGFR levels were elevated in diabetic mice with impaired insulin secretion and decreased in high-fat diet-fed mice and ob/ob mice. The serum sEGFR levels increased after the administration of a dual inhibitor of IGF-1/insulin receptor or streptozotocin. In humans with normal glucose tolerance or T2DM, the serum sEGFR levels were correlated with the fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, HbA1c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides levels. These findings suggest that sEGFR might be a biomarker for evaluating insulin resistance or a therapeutic target of liraglutide.","Kyohara, MayuShirakawa, JunOkuyama, TomokoKimura, AyukoTogashi, YuTajima, KazukiHirano, HisashiTerauchi, Yasuo","Kyohara MShirakawa JOkuyama TKimura ATogashi YTajima KHirano HTerauchi Y","Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama City University, Japan.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama City University, Japan.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama City University, Japan.Advanced Medical Research Center, Yokohama City University, Japan.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama City University, Japan.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama City University, Japan.Advanced Medical Research Center, Yokohama City University, Japan.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama City University, Japan.","eng",NA,"Journal Article",NA,"United States","Endocrinology","Endocrinology","0375040","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)0 (Insulin)0 (Lipids)0 (Proteome)839I73S42A (Liraglutide)EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)","IM","AnimalsBiomarkers/*bloodBlood Glucose/metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/drug therapyEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent AssayErbB Receptors/antagonists & inhibitors/*bloodHumansHypoglycemic Agents/pharmacologyInsulin/blood*Insulin ResistanceLipids/bloodLiraglutide/pharmacologyMaleMice, Inbred C57BLMice, KnockoutProteome/*metabolismProteomics/*methods",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017/10/14 06:00","2017/12/19 06:00",NA,"2017/10/14 06:00","2017/04/07 00:00 [received]2017/09/29 00:00 [accepted]2017/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]2017/12/19 06:00 [medline]2017/10/14 06:00 [entrez]","4344850 [pii]10.1210/en.2017-00339 [doi]","ppublish","Endocrinology. 2017 Dec 1;158(12):4152-4164. doi: 10.1210/en.2017-00339.","Copyright © 2017 Endocrine Society.",NA,"UMIN CTR/UMIN000020474","10.1210/en.2017-00339",NA,2017

This study, comprising two groups of individuals, one on a low-calorie diet (n = 5) and one undergoing bariatric surgery (n = 7), used both targeted and untargeted proteomic approaches to determine changes in protein levels pre and post-intervention (i.e. 3-6 months later). Changes were observed in both circulating and excreted proteins following weight loss. Targeted multiplexed biochip arrays measured 12 plasma peptides/proteins involved in metabolism and inflammation: C-peptide, ferritin, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 alpha, resistin, insulin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, leptin, plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1, adiponectin, cystatin C, and C-reactive protein. Following a low-calorie diet, plasma insulin and C-reactive protein levels were significantly reduced (P = 0.045 and P = 0.030, respectively); adiponectin increased and leptin decreased following surgery (P = 0.014 and P = 0.005, respectively). Untargeted proteomic analysis employing 2D difference in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE) showed 28 protein spots with ≥1.5-fold changes in expression following weight loss by a low-calorie diet; comparison of pre and post-intervention urine samples from the bariatric surgery group showed changes in excretion of 110 protein spots. The combination of targeted protein analysis by multiplexed arrays and an exploratory (i.e. an unbiased or discovery) proteomic assessment of hundreds of proteins offers valuable insights into the mechanistic differences between alternative weight-loss strategies. This is a powerful hypothesis-generating approach to study complex, multifactorial syndromes such as obesity. The findings that arise from these studies can then be validated in targeted, hypothesis-directed investigations.","Alfadda, Assim ATurjoman, Abdullah ArifMoustafa, Amr SAl-Naami, Mohammed YChishti, Muhammad ASallam, Reem MGibson, DavidDuncan, Mark W","Alfadda AATurjoman AAMoustafa ASAl-Naami MYChishti MASallam RMGibson DDuncan MW","Obesity Research Center, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20140325","Switzerland","Exp Biol Med (Maywood)","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)","100973463","0 (Blood Proteins)0 (Proteome)","IM","Adult*Bariatric SurgeryBlood Proteins/*analysis*Caloric RestrictionElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-DimensionalFemaleHumansMaleObesity/surgery/*therapyProtein Array AnalysisProteome/*analysisUrine/*chemistryWeight Loss",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","Obesitybariatric surgerylow-calorie dietmultiplex biochip arrayproteomics",NA,"2014/03/29 06:00","2014/06/27 06:00",NA,"2014/03/27 06:00","2014/03/27 06:00 [entrez]2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]2014/06/27 06:00 [medline]","1535370214523894 [pii]10.1177/1535370214523894 [doi]","ppublish","Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2014 May;239(5):568-80. doi: 10.1177/1535370214523894.

Abnormal glucose uptake and lipid oxidation are hallmark features of GDM prompting us to use an exploratory proteomics approach to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying differences in skeletal muscle metabolism between obese pregnant women with GDM (OGDM) and obese pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (ONGT). Functional validation was performed in a second cohort of obese OGDM and ONGT pregnant women. Quantitative proteomic analysis in rectus abdominus skeletal muscle tissue collected at delivery revealed reduced protein content of mitochondrial complex I (C-I) subunits (NDUFS3, NDUFV2) and altered content of proteins involved in calcium homeostasis/signaling (calcineurin A, α1-syntrophin, annexin A4) in OGDM (n = 6) vs. ONGT (n = 6). Follow-up analyses showed reduced enzymatic activity of mitochondrial complexes C-I, C-III, and C-IV (-60-75%) in the OGDM (n = 8) compared with ONGT (n = 10) subjects, though no differences were observed for mitochondrial complex protein content. Upstream regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation were not different between groups. However, AMPK phosphorylation was dramatically reduced by 75% in the OGDM women. These data suggest that GDM is associated with reduced skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation and disordered calcium homeostasis. These relationships deserve further attention as they may represent novel risk factors for development of GDM and may have implications on the effectiveness of physical activity interventions on both treatment strategies for GDM and for prevention of type 2 diabetes postpartum.","Boyle, Kristen EHwang, HyonsonJanssen, Rachel CDeVente, James MBarbour, Linda AHernandez, Teri LMandarino, Lawrence JLappas, MarthaFriedman, Jacob E","Boyle KEHwang HJanssen RCDeVente JMBarbour LAHernandez TLMandarino LJLappas MFriedman JE","Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.Boston Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, United States of America.Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.Department of Kinesiology, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, United States of America; Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Tempe, Arizona, United States of America.Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Mercy Perinatal Research Centre, Mercy Hospital for Women, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.","eng","R01 DK078645/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesK12 HD057022/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United StatesUL1 TR001082/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United StatesF32 DK089743/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States5R01 DK062155/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesT32 DK007658/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR01 DK062155/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR01 DK047936/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesP30 DK048520/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20140912","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)0 (Muscle Proteins)EC 2.7.4.3 (Adenylate Kinase)","IM","Adenylate Kinase/metabolismAdult*Calcium SignalingDiabetes, Gestational/*metabolismElectron TransportFemaleGlucose Tolerance TestHumansMitochondria/enzymologyMitochondrial Proteins/*metabolismMuscle Proteins/*metabolismMuscle, Skeletal/*metabolismObesity/metabolismPhosphorylationPregnancyProteomics","PMC4162568",NA,NA,NA,"Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2014/09/13 06:00","2015/05/29 06:00","2014/09/12","2014/09/13 06:00","2014/05/08 00:00 [received]2014/08/04 00:00 [accepted]2014/09/13 06:00 [entrez]2014/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]2014/09/12 00:00 [pmc-release]","PONE-D-14-20097 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0106872 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2014 Sep 12;9(9):e106872. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0106872. eCollection 2014.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0106872",NA,2014

The presence of electrolytes, mucus, glycoproteins, enzymes, antibacterial compounds, and gingival crevicular fluid in saliva ensures the optimum condition of oral cavity and general health condition. Saliva collection has been proven non-invasive, convenient, and inexpensive compared to conventional venipuncture procedure. These distinctive advantages provide a promising potential of saliva as a diagnostic fluid. Through comprehensive analysis, an array of salivary proteins and peptides may be beneficial as biomarkers in oral and systemic diseases. In this review, we discuss the utility of human salivary proteomes and tabulate the recent salivary biomarkers found in subjects with acute myocardial infarction as well as respective methods employed. In a clinical setting, since acute myocardial infarction contributes to large cases of mortality worldwide, an early intervention using these biomarkers will provide an effective solution to reduce global heart attack incidence particularly among its high-risk group of type-2 diabetes mellitus patients. The utility of salivary biomarkers will make the prediction of this cardiac event possible due to its reliability hence improve the quality of life of the patients. Current challenges in saliva collection are also addressed to improve the quality of saliva samples and produce robust biomarkers for future use in clinical applications.","Rahim, Mohd Aizat AbdulRahim, Zubaidah Haji AbdulAhmad, Wan Azman WanHashim, Onn Haji","Rahim MARahim ZHAhmad WAHashim OH","1.

To date, there are no simple clinical tests for the early detection of T2DM. METHOD: To identify potential peptide biomarkers for such applications, 406 sera of T2DM patients (n = 206) and healthy controls (n = 200) are analyzed by using MALDI-TOF MS with a cross-sectional case-control design. RESULT: Six peptides (peaks m/z 1452.9, 1692.8, 1946.0, 2115.1, 2211.0 and 4053.6) are identified as candidate biomarkers for T2DM. A diagnostic model constructed with six peptides is able to discriminate T2DM patients from healthy controls, with an accuracy of 82.20%, sensitivity of 82.50%, and specificity of 77.80% in the validation set. Peptide peaks m/z 1452.9 and 1692.8 are identified as fragments of the complement C3f, while peptide peaks m/z 1946.0, 2115.1, and 2211.0 are identified as the fragments of kininogen 1 isoform 1 precursor. CONCLUSION: This study reinforces proteomic analyses as a potential technique for defining significant clinical peptide biomarkers, providing a simple and convenient diagnostic model for T2DM in clinical examination.","Meng, QiutaoGe, SiqiYan, WenhuaLi, RuishengDou, JingtaoWang, HaibingWang, BaoanMa, QingweiZhou, YongSong, ManshuYu, XinweiWang, HaoYang, XinghuaLiu, FenAlzain, Mohamed AliYan, YuxiangZhang, LingWu, LijuanZhao, FeifeiHe, YanGuo, XiuhuaChen, FengXu, WeizhuoGarcia, MoniqueMenon, DesmondWang, YouxinMu, YimingWang, Wei","Meng QGe SYan WLi RDou JWang HWang BMa QZhou YSong MYu XWang HYang XLiu FAlzain MAYan YZhang LWu LZhao FHe YGuo XChen FXu WGarcia MMenon DWang YMu YWang W","Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia.Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.Research and Technology Service Center, Chinese PLA 302 Hospital, Beijing, China.Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.Bioyong (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Central of Laboratory, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing, China.School of Life Science and Biopharmaceuticals, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China.School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia.School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Department of Endocrinology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Clinical Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.School of Medical and Health Sciences, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20161130","Germany","Proteomics Clin Appl","Proteomics.

This study aimed to identify specific biomarkers that can detect lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) in T2DM patients for the early diagnosis of LAC. METHODS: The clinical information of hospitalized T2DM patients diagnosed with various cancers was collected by reviewing medical records in Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University from January 1, 2015, to June 30, 2020. To discover diagnostic biomarkers for early-stage LAC in the T2DM population, 20 samples obtained from 5 healthy controls, 5 T2DM patients, 5 LAC patients and 5 T2DM patients with LAC (T2DM + LAC) were subjected to sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectrum (SWATH-MS) analysis to identify specific differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs) for LAC in patients with T2DM. Then, these results were validated by parallel reaction monitoring MS (PRM-MS) and ELISA analyses. RESULTS: Lung cancer was the most common malignant tumor in patients with T2DM, and LAC accounted for the majority of cases. Using SWATH-MS analysis, we found 13 proteins to be unique in T2DM patients with early LAC. Two serum proteins were further validated by PRM-MS analysis, namely, pregnancy-zone protein (PZP) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). Furthermore, the diagnostic values of these proteins were validated by ELISA, and PZP was validated as a novel serum biomarker for screening LAC in T2DM patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that PZP could be used as a novel serum biomarker for the identification of LAC in T2DM patients, which will enhance auxiliary diagnosis and assist in the selection of surgical treatment at an early stage.","Yang, JiayueYang, ChengShen, HongWu, WenjunTian, ZhenXu, QinghuaCao, CuipingYe, ShugaoBan, LeTong, XinMei, Jie","Yang JYang CShen HWu WTian ZXu QCao CYe SBan LTong XMei JAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-7799-8129","Department of Endocrinology, Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214023, China.Department of Gastroenterology, Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214023, China.Department of Endocrinology, Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214023, China.Department of Endocrinology, Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214023, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214023, China.Department of Endocrinology, Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214023, China.Department of Endocrinology, Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214023, China.Department of Chest Surgery, Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214023, China.Department of Chest Surgery, Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214023, China.Department of Clinical Laboratory, Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, 214023, China.Department of Oncology, Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, No. 299 Qingyang Road, Wuxi, 214023, China. meijie1996@njmu.edu.cn.","eng","M202016/General Project of Wuxi Health Commission/Z202017/Major Project of Wuxi Health Commission/BJ2020011/Taihu Talent Program/","Journal Article","20210310","England","Cancer Cell Int","Cancer cell international","101139795",NA,NA,NA,"PMC7945354",NA,"NOTNLM","BiomarkerLung adenocarcinomaMass spectrumType 2 diabetes mellitus","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","2021/03/12 06:00","2021/03/12 06:01","2021/03/10","2021/03/11 05:48","2021/01/24 00:00 [received]2021/03/01 00:00 [accepted]2021/03/11 05:48 [entrez]2021/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]2021/03/12 06:01 [medline]2021/03/10 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1186/s12935-021-01861-8 [pii]1861 [pii]10.1186/s12935-021-01861-8 [doi]","epublish","Cancer Cell Int. 2021 Mar 10;21(1):162. doi: 10.1186/s12935-021-01861-8.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1186/s12935-021-01861-8",NA,2021

Isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation labeling and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry allowed us to identify 357 proteins significantly differentially expressed in diabetic versus control semen (>1.2 or <0.83). According to gene ontology enrichment and pathway analyses, many of these differentially expressed proteins are associated with sperm function, including binding of sperm to the zona pellucida and proteasome function; of particular interest, half of these proteins were related to mitochondrial metabolism.

Twelve individuals from each group were then randomly selected as the screening cohort for proteomics analysis and the rest as the validation cohort. The results showed that humoral immune response, complement activation, complement and coagulation cascades, renin-angiotensin system, and cell adhesion molecules were closely related to the progression of DN. Five overlapping proteins (KLK1, CSPG4, PLAU, SERPINA3, and ALB) were identified as potential biomarkers by machine learning methods. Among them, KLK1 and CSPG4 were positively correlated with the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), and SERPINA3 was negatively correlated with the UACR, which were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

METHODS: A fresh residual sera panel was collected from 80 healthy control (HC) individuals and 72 T2DM patients. Metabolites/ratios of interest including tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), kynurenic acid (KA), xanthurenic acid (XA), neopterin (NEO), KA/KYN ratio and KYN/TRP ratio were determined using a targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics approach, and the difference between groups was assessed. Supervised orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis and differential metabolite screening with fold change (FC) were performed to identify distinct biomarkers. The diagnostic performance of KP metabolites in T2DM was evaluated. RESULTS: Significant decreases of TRP, 5HT, KA, XA, and KA/KYN and increases of KYN/TRP and NEO in T2DM compared to HC group were observed (P < 0.05). The KP metabolites panel significantly changed between T2DM and HC groups (Q(2): 0.925, P < 0.005). 5HT (FC: 0.63, P < 0.01) and NEO (FC: 3.27, P < 0.01) were proven to be distinct differential metabolites. A combined testing of fasting plasma glucose and KYN/TRP showed good value in the prediction of T2DM (AUC: 0.904, 95% CI 0.843-0.947). CONCLUSIONS: The targeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics study is a powerful tool for evaluating the status of T2DM. This study facilitated the application of KP metabolomics into future clinical practice. 5HT and NEO are promising biomarkers in T2DM. KYN/TRP was highly associated with the development of T2DM and may serve as a potential treatment target.","Liu, ZhenniMa, ZijiaJin, LiziNizhamuding, XiaerbanuZeng, JieZhang, TianjiaoZhang, JiangtaoWang, JingZhao, HaijianZhou, WeiyanZhang, Chuanbao","Liu ZMa ZJin LNizhamuding XZeng JZhang TZhang JWang JZhao HZhou WZhang C","National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing Hospital/National Center of Gerontology, PR China; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, PR China.National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing Hospital/National Center of Gerontology, PR China; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, PR China.National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing Hospital/National Center of Gerontology, PR China; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, PR China.National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing Hospital/National Center of Gerontology, PR China; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, PR China.National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing Hospital/National Center of Gerontology, PR China.National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing Hospital/National Center of Gerontology, PR China; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, PR China.National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing Hospital/National Center of Gerontology, PR China.National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing Hospital/National Center of Gerontology, PR China.National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing Hospital/National Center of Gerontology, PR China.National Center for Clinical Laboratories, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing Hospital/National Center of Gerontology, PR China.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) arises from a dysregulated response to elevated glucose levels in the circulation. Globally, the prevalence of T2D has increased dramatically in all age groups. T2D in older adults is associated with higher mortality and reduced functional status, leading to higher rate of institutionalization. Despite the potential healthcare challenges associated with the presence of T2D in the elderly, the pathogenesis and phenotype of late-onset T2D is not well studied. Here we applied untargeted metabolite profiling of urine samples from people with and without late-onset T2D using ultra-performance liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to identify urinary biomarkers for late-onset T2D in the elderly. Statistical modeling of measurements and thorough validation of structural assignment using liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) have led to the identification of metabolite biomarkers associated with late-onset T2D. Lower levels of phenylalanine, acetylhistidine, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were found in urine samples of T2D subjects validated with commercial standards. Elevated levels of 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), which previously has only been implicated in animal model of diabetes, was found in urine of older people with T2D.","Tam, Zhi YangNg, Sean PinTan, Ling QiaoLin, Chih-HsienRothenbacher, DietrichKlenk, JochenBoehm, Bernhard Otto","Tam ZYNg SPTan LQLin CHRothenbacher DKlenk JBoehm BO","Singapore Phenome Center, Experimental Medicine Building, Nanyang Technological University, 59 Nanyang Drive, Singapore, 636921, Singapore.Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, 59 Nanyang Drive, Singapore, 636921, Singapore.Singapore Phenome Center, Experimental Medicine Building, Nanyang Technological University, 59 Nanyang Drive, Singapore, 636921, Singapore.Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, 59 Nanyang Drive, Singapore, 636921, Singapore.Singapore Phenome Center, Experimental Medicine Building, Nanyang Technological University, 59 Nanyang Drive, Singapore, 636921, Singapore.Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, 59 Nanyang Drive, Singapore, 636921, Singapore.Singapore Phenome Center, Experimental Medicine Building, Nanyang Technological University, 59 Nanyang Drive, Singapore, 636921, Singapore.Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, 59 Nanyang Drive, Singapore, 636921, Singapore.Institute of Epidemiology and Medical Biometry, Ulm University, Helmholtzstrasse 22, 89081, Ulm, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology and Medical Biometry, Ulm University, Helmholtzstrasse 22, 89081, Ulm, Germany.Department of Clinical Gerontology, Robert-Bosch-Hospital, Auerbachstrasse 110, 70376, Stuttgart, Germany.Singapore Phenome Center, Experimental Medicine Building, Nanyang Technological University, 59 Nanyang Drive, Singapore, 636921, Singapore. bernhard.boehm@ntu.edu.sg.Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, 59 Nanyang Drive, Singapore, 636921, Singapore. bernhard.boehm@ntu.edu.sg.Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK. bernhard.boehm@ntu.edu.sg.Department of Internal Medicine I, Ulm University Medical Centre, Ulm University, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081, Ulm, Germany. bernhard.boehm@ntu.edu.sg.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20170629","England","Sci Rep","Scientific reports","101563288","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Age FactorsAgedAged, 80 and over*BiomarkersCase-Control StudiesChromatography, LiquidDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*metabolism/urineFemaleHumansMale*Metabolome*Metabolomics/methodsTandem Mass Spectrometry","PMC5491522",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare that they have no competing interests.FIR  Kiat, Kelvin Goh KauIR   Kiat KGKFIR  Suwanchaikasem, PipobIR   Suwanchaikasem PFIR  Tipthara, PornpimolIR   Tipthara PFIR  Yi Yang, SongIR   Yi Yang SFIR  Becker, TIR   Becker TFIR  Stingl, JIR   Stingl JFIR  Koenig, WIR   Koenig WFIR  Riepe, MIR   Riepe MFIR  Peter, RIR   Peter RFIR  Geiger, HIR   Geiger HFIR  Ludolph, AIR   Ludolph AFIR  Arnim, C VIR   Arnim CVFIR  Nagel, GIR   Nagel GFIR  Weinmayr, GIR   Weinmayr GFIR  Rapp, KIR   Rapp KFIR  Denkinger, M DIR   Denkinger MDFIR  Dallmeier, DIR   Dallmeier DFIR  Steinacker, J MIR   Steinacker JMFIR  Laszlo, RIR   Laszlo R","2017/07/01 06:00","2019/01/11 06:00","2017/06/29","2017/07/01 06:00","2016/10/21 00:00 [received]2017/03/30 00:00 [accepted]2017/07/01 06:00 [entrez]2017/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]2019/01/11 06:00 [medline]2017/06/29 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1038/s41598-017-01735-y [pii]1735 [pii]10.1038/s41598-017-01735-y [doi]","epublish","Sci Rep. 2017 Jun 29;7(1):4392. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-01735-y.",NA,"SPC TeamActiFE Study Group",NA,"10.1038/s41598-017-01735-y",NA,2017

However, the mechanism underlying its beneficial effects remains unclear. We investigated the inhibitory effects and mechanisms of HPE on insulin resistance, inflammation, and aortic injury in T2D rats, using metformin (MF) as a positive control. High-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was used to determine the primary polyphenols in HPE. Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining was used to evaluate pathological conditions of the skeletal muscle, liver, and aorta vessels in each group. The levels of serum and intestinal tissue oxidative stress, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also assessed. Western blotting was used to evaluate protein expression levels in the associated molecular pathway. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from colon contents were determined using headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility chromatography. Our results showed that supplementation with 300 mg HPE/kg body weight over four weeks significantly improved total cholesterol (TC), total triglyceride (TG), insulin, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in diabetic rats (p < 0.01). The lesions of skeletal muscle, liver, and aorta in diabetic rats were significantly improved. HPE supplementation also significantly downregulated the inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1) in the liver of diabetic rats via the SIRT1/AMPK/NF-κB signaling pathway. Furthermore, HPE significantly reduced insulin resistance in T2D rats by upregulating the phosphorylation of glucose absorption protein (GLUT4) and insulin resistance-associated proteins, p-IRS1, p-AKT, and p-PI3K, in the rat liver (p < 0.01). The findings show that HPE could also alleviate aortic injury by activating SIRT1 and regulating the NF-κB and Wnt2/β-catenin signaling pathways. Overall, the results of this study suggest that both HPE and MF have similar inhibitory effects on T2D in rats and that HPE could be used as a functional food component in the adjuvant treatment of T2D.","Liu, SuwenYu, JinchengFu, MengfanWang, XinfangChang, Xuedong","Liu SYu JFu MWang XChang X","College of Food Science & Technology, Hebei Normal University of Science and Technology, Qinhuangdao, Hebei 066004, China.

Thus, a targeted metabolomics for amino acids and acylcarnitines in patients with diabetes and its complications was carried out. METHODS: A cohort of 54 normal individuals and 156 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or diabetic complications enrolled from the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinzhou Medical University was studied. The subjects were divided into five main groups: normal individuals, impaired fasting glucose, overt diabetes, diabetic microvascular complications, and diabetic peripheral vascular disease. The technique of tandem mass spectrometry was applied to obtain the plasma metabolite profiles. Metabolomics multivariate statistics were applied for the metabolic data analysis and the differential metabolites determination. RESULTS: A total of 10 cross-comparisons within diabetes and its complications were designed to explore the differential metabolites. The results demonstrated that eight comparisons existed and yielded significant metabolic differences. A total number of 24 differential metabolites were determined from six selected comparisons, including up-regulated amino acids, down-regulated medium-chain and long-chain acylcarnitines. Altered differential metabolites provided six panels of biomarkers, which were helpful in distinguishing diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that the biomarker panels consisted of specific amino acids and acylcarnitines which could reflect the metabolic variations among the different stages of diabetes and might be useful for the differential diagnosis of prediabetes, overt diabetes and diabetic complications.","Li, XinLi, YanchengLiang, YuanhaoHu, RuixueXu, WenliLiu, Yufeng","Li XLi YLiang YHu RXu WLiu Y","School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Liaoning University, Shenyang, China.Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health and Health Professions & College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Liaoning University, Shenyang, China.School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Liaoning University, Shenyang, China.School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Liaoning University, Shenyang, China.School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Liaoning University, Shenyang, China.Natural Products Pharmaceutical Engineering Technology Research Center of Liaoning Province, Shenyang, China.","eng","81403177/National Natural Science Foundation of China/F12-277-1-14/Science and Technology Planning Project of Shenyang Science and Technology Bureau/LR2018047/Innovative Talents Support Program of Liaoning Province/","Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20210309","Korea (South)","Diabetes Metab J","Diabetes & metabolism journal","101556588","0 (Amino Acids)0 (acylcarnitine)S7UI8SM58A (Carnitine)","IM","Amino AcidsCarnitine/analogs & derivatives*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/diagnosis*Diabetic AngiopathiesHumansMetabolomics*Prediabetic State/complications/diagnosis","PMC8024149",NA,"NOTNLM","Amino acidsCarnitineDiabetes mellitus, type 2Metabolomics","CONFLICTS OF INTEREST No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.","2021/03/10 06:00","2021/10/16 06:00","2021/03/01","2021/03/09 01:18","2019/11/06 00:00 [received]2020/02/26 00:00 [accepted]2021/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]2021/03/09 01:18 [entrez]2021/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","dmj.2019.0209 [pii]dmj-2019-0209 [pii]10.4093/dmj.2019.0209 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes Metab J. 2021 Mar;45(2):195-208. doi: 10.4093/dmj.2019.0209.

We describe a quantitative proteomics project to measure the T2DM serum proteome response to the Xiaoke Pill and Glibenclamide. METHODS: Based on a recently conducted 48-week clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Glibenclamide (n = 400) and Xiaoke Pill (n = 400), after matching for age, sex, BMI, drug dose and whether hypoglycemia occurred, 32 patients were selected for the serum based proteomic analysis and divided into four groups (with/without hypoglycemia treated with Xiaoke Pill or Glibenclamide, n = 8 for each group). We screened the differential serum proteins related to treatments and the onset of hypoglycemia using the iTRAQ labeling quantitative proteomics technique. Baseline and follow-up samples were used. RESULTS: The quantitative proteomics experiments demonstrated that 25 and 21 proteins differed upon treatment with the Xiaoke Pill in patients without and with hypoglycemia, respectively, while 24 and 25 proteins differed upon treatment with Glibenclamide in patients without and with hypoglycemia, respectively. The overlap of different proteins between the patients with and without hypoglycemia given the same drug treatment was much greater than between the patients given different drug treatments. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the serum proteins response to the two different anti-diabetic drug treatments may serve as a sensitive biomarker for evaluation of the therapeutic effects and continue investigations into the mechanism.","Zhang, XiuyingSun, HaidanPaul, Sanjoy KWang, QuanhuiLou, XiaominHou, GuixueWen, BoJi, LinongLiu, Siqi","Zhang XSun HPaul SKWang QLou XHou GWen BJi LLiu S","Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Diabetes Centre, No. 11, Xi Zhi Men Nan Da Jie, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044 China.

Thus, convenient and effective screening strategies for CRC should be developed for the T2DM population to increase the detection rate of CRC. Methods: Twenty serum samples extracted from five healthy participants, five T2DM patients, five CRC patients and five T2DM patients with CRC (T2DM + CRC) were submitted to data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) analysis to discover unique differentially altered proteins (DAPs) for CRC in patients with T2DM. Then, the diagnostic value of pregnancy zone protein (PZP) was validated by ELISA analysis in the validated cohort. Results: Based on DIA-MS analysis, we found eight unique proteins specific to T2DM patients with CRC. Among these proteins, four proteins showed different expression between the T2DM + CRC and T2DM groups, and PZP exhibited the largest difference. Next, the diagnostic value of serum PZP was validated by ELISA analysis with an AUC of 0.713. Moreover, the combination of PZP, CA199 and CEA exhibited encouraging diagnostic value, and the AUC reached 0.916.

Few studies, however, explored the association using objective biomarkers (particular for daidzein metabolite-equol) of isoflavones. We aimed to explore the association of urinary equol, daidzein and genistein concentrations with T2D and examine the mediating roles of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4). METHODS: This prospective study included 2818 subjects. Urinary concentrations of equol, daidzein and genistein were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The associations between urinary isoflavones and T2D incidence were evaluated by cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, urinary equol except daidzein and genistein was inversely associated with T2D incidence. In comparison with the first tertile, multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for T2D incidence in the second and third tertile of equol concentration were 0.52 (0.37, 0.73) and 0.72 (0.53, 0.97), respectively. In stratified analyses by sex, the HR (95% CI) of men in the second vs. first tertile of equol was 0.29 (0.14, 0.58). Equivalent estimation in women was 0.67 (0.45, 1.01). Neither women nor men in the third tertile showed significant difference of T2D incidence compared with the first tertile. In path analyses, there was no evidence of mediating effects of hsCRP and RBP4 on the ""equol-T2D"" relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary equol was favorably associated with a decreased T2D incidence in Chinese adults. The equol-T2D relationship might not be mediated by hsCRP and RBP4.

A number of well-characterised cardiovascular risk factors which contribute to the development of the majority of cardiovascular events have been identified, including dyslipidaemia, hypertension and diabetes. Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a 3 to 5-fold increased risk for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). They may have a cluster of haemostatic abnormalities, including elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and fibrinogen, which contribute to acute thrombotic events. It is clear that additional unidentified risk factors contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular events, and so the search for novel biomarkers and effectors, particularly in individuals with T2DM, remains a major challenge of cardiovascular medicine. Plasma and cellular proteins which contribute to thrombus formation have the potential to confer a pro-thrombotic state and represent a link between genotype, environment and disease phenotype. The comprehensive analysis of these proteins is now increasingly facilitated through the continued development of proteomic technologies which provide multifaceted approaches to the identification of novel biomarkers and/or effectors of thrombus formation and on which future anticoagulant and thrombolytic therapies may be based. This review provides an overview of current proteomic technologies. It focuses on the recent studies in which these technologies have been applied in the search for novel proteins that may confer increased risk of acute cardiovascular diseases and therefore that may influence disease progression and therapy.","Howes, Joanna-MarieKeen, Jeff NFindlay, John BcCarter, Angela M","Howes JMKeen JNFindlay JBCarter AM","Division of Cardiovascular & Diabetes Research, The LIGHT Laboratories, University of Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleReview",NA,"England","Diab Vasc Dis Res","Diabetes & vascular disease research","101234011","0 (Anticoagulants)0 (Biomarkers)0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)","IM","AnimalsAnticoagulants/pharmacology/*therapeutic useBiomarkers/metabolismBiomedical Research/*methodsBlood Coagulation/drug effectsDisease Progression*Drug DesignFibrinolytic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic useHumans*ProteomicsThrombosis/blood/*drug therapy/metabolismRF   54",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2008/09/09 09:00","2008/10/04 09:00",NA,"2008/09/09 09:00","2008/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]2008/10/04 09:00 [medline]2008/09/09 09:00 [entrez]","3119 [pii]10.3132/dvdr.2008.033 [doi]","ppublish","Diab Vasc Dis Res. 2008 Sep;5(3):205-12. doi: 10.3132/dvdr.2008.033.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3132/dvdr.2008.033",NA,2008

Sanjappa & Pradeep (Ge-Gen in Chinese), Coptis chinensis Franch (Huang-Lian), and Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J. Presl (Rou-Gui). GGJTW is used for treatment of diabetes in China, reflecting the potent hypoglycemic effect of its ingredients. However, little is known of the hypoglycemic effect of GGJTW and the underlying metabolic mechanism. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the hypoglycemic effect of GGJTW in type 2 diabetic rats and the metabolic mechanism of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF/MS)-based metabolomics approach was used for monitoring hyperglycaemia induced by high-sugar high-fat fodder and streptozotocin (STZ), and the protective effect of GGJTW. Dynamic fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, body weight, and biochemical parameters, including lipid levels, hepatic-renal function, and hepatic histopathology were used to confirm the hyperglycaemic toxicity and attenuation effects. An orthogonal partial least squared-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) approach highlighted significant differences in the metabolome of the healthy control, diabetic, and drug-treated rats. The metabolomics pathway analysis (MetPA) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) database were used to investigate the underlying metabolic pathways. RESULTS: Metabolic profiling revealed 37 metabolites as the most potential biomarker metabolites distinguishing GGJTW-treated rats from model rats. Most of the metabolites were primarily associated with bile acid metabolism and lipid metabolism. The most critical pathway was primary bile acid biosynthesis pathway involving the up-regulation of the levels of cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), taurocholic acid (TCA), glycocholic acid (GCA), taurochenodesoxycholic acid (TCDCA), and taurine. CONCLUSIONS: The significantly-altered metabolite levels indicated the hypoglycemic effect of GGJTW on diabetic rats and the underlying metabolic mechanism. This study will be meaningful for the clinical application of GGJTW and valuable for further exploration of the mechanism.","Wang, WenboZhao, LinlinHe, ZhenyuWu, NingLi, QiuxiaQiu, XinjianZhou, LuWang, Dongsheng","Wang WZhao LHe ZWu NLi QQiu XZhou LWang D","Institute of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008 Hunan, China.

We investigated the differences in plasma lipid concentrations in 63 participants categorized into six groups (middle-aged Korean men); Normal, Pre-diabetes (pre-DM), and Diabetes mellitus (DM) with or without abdominal obesity (AO or lean). The lipidomic profiles were determined by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Sphingomyelin (SM) levels in plasma were significantly higher in the pre-DM with AO than in pre-DM with lean (p = 0.021). SM concentrations correlated positively with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (r = 0.256, p = 0.044), cholesteryl ester (CE) (r = 0.483, p < 0.0001), ceramide (r = 0.489, p < 0.0001) and plasmanyl phosphatidylcholine (PC) (r = 0.446, p < 0.0001).

TMT-based proteomics and WGCNA are used to identify the differentially expressed proteins in tear proteome of type 2 diabetes with DE. The aim is to provide a molecular basis for exploring possible mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of diabetic DE. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Subjects are divided into four groups (ten in each): type 2 diabetes with DE; type 2 diabetes without DE; non-diabetes with DE and normal controls. All subjects undergo DE tests. Total proteins are extracted and quantitatively labeled with TMT, then analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. WGCNA is used to identify the hub genes. Finally, differentially expressed proteins are validated by ELISA. RESULTS: A total of 1922 proteins are identified, of which 1814 contain quantitative information. Ultimately, 650 of these proteins yield quantitative values. WGCNA performed on these 650 proteins reveal four distinct hub genes of diabetic DE. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: DE is associated with the differential expression of tear proteins in type 2 diabetes. Inflammation, immune factors, and lipid metabolism may play a role in the development of diabetic DE. LTF, LYZ, ZAG, and DNAJC3 have the potential to be the biomarkers of DE in diabetes.","Zou, XinrongZhang, PeiXu, YiLu, LinaZou, Haidong","Zou XAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8999-3242Zhang PXu YLu LZou H","Department of Preventative Ophthalmology, Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Center, Shanghai, 200040, China.Department of Ophthalmology, Fengcheng Hospital, Fengxian District, Shanghai, 201411, China.Department of Ophthalmology, Gonghui Hospital, Jingan District, Shanghai, 200041, China.Department of Preventative Ophthalmology, Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Center, Shanghai, 200040, China.Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200080, China.Department of Preventative Ophthalmology, Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Center, Shanghai, 200040, China.Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200080, China.Department of Preventative Ophthalmology, Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Center, Shanghai, 200040, China.Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200080, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20200129","Germany","Proteomics Clin Appl","Proteomics.

A total of 32 serum proteins were preliminarily identified as the MODY-related. Further verification test toward the individual samples demonstrated the 12 candidates with the significantly different abundance in the MODY patients. A comparison of the 12 proteins among the sera of type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, MODY, and healthy subjects was conducted and revealed a protein signature related with MODY composed of the serum proteins such as SERPINA7, APOC4, LPA, C6, and F5.","Tuerxunyiming, MuhadasiXian, FengZi, JinYimamu, YilihamujiangAbuduwayite, ReshalaitiRen, YanLi, QidanAbudula, AbuliziLiu, SiQiMohemaiti, Patamu","Tuerxunyiming MXian FZi JYimamu YAbuduwayite RRen YLi QAbudula ALiu SMohemaiti PAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-1778-6380","Xinjiang Medical University , Urumqi 830011, China.University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100049, China.Proteomics Division, BGI-Shenzhen , Shenzhen, Guangdong 518083, China.First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University , Urumqi 830011, China.First Affiliated Hospital, Xinjiang Medical University , Urumqi 830011, China.Proteomics Division, BGI-Shenzhen , Shenzhen, Guangdong 518083, China.Proteomics Division, BGI-Shenzhen , Shenzhen, Guangdong 518083, China.Xinjiang Medical University , Urumqi 830011, China.University of Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing 100049, China.Proteomics Division, BGI-Shenzhen , Shenzhen, Guangdong 518083, China.Xinjiang Medical University , Urumqi 830011, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20171214","United States","J Proteome Res","Journal of proteome research","101128775","0 (Blood Proteins)Mason-Type Diabetes","IM","Blood Proteins/*analysisDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*geneticsFamilyFemaleHumansMaleMutationPedigree*Proteomics",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","MRMbiomarkersdiabetesiTRAQserum",NA,"2017/11/29 06:00","2018/09/27 06:00",NA,"2017/11/29 06:00","2017/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]2018/09/27 06:00 [medline]2017/11/29 06:00 [entrez]","10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00727 [doi]","ppublish","J Proteome Res. 2018 Jan 5;17(1):670-679. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00727.

However, the extensive pharmacological characteristics and the underlying mechanism are unknown. This study investigated the mechanisms by which SZ-A ameliorates glucose metabolism in KKAy mice, an animal model of T2DM. Diabetic KKAy mice were treated intragastrically with SZ-A once daily for 8 weeks, after which glucose levels, lipid metabolism, gut microbiome, systemic inflammatory factors, luminal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (fecal samples), and ileal proteomic changes were evaluated. The ileum tissues were collected, and the effects of SZ-A on pathological inflammatory damage were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein expression levels of various inflammatory markers, including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa B p65, were detected in the ileum tissues. SZ-A improved glucose metabolism with enhanced insulin response and elevated glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) nearly 2.7-fold during the glucose tolerance test in diabetic KKAy mice. Gut microbiota analysis demonstrated that SZ-A administration elevated the abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Verrucomicrobia, reduced the levels of Rikenellaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae; and increased the concentrations of fecal acetic and propionic acids compared to the diabetic model group. Additionally, SZ-A markedly improved ileal inflammatory injury and pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration and improved intestinal mucosal barrier function in diabetic KKAy mice. SZ-A also attenuated the levels of circulating endotoxin, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines in the mice sera. Collectively, SZ-A ameliorated the overall metabolic profile including glucose and lipid metabolism in KKAy mice, which may be associated with an improvement in GLP-1 and insulin secretion, at least in part by modulating the gut microbiome and relieving the degree of ileal and systemic inflammation.","Liu, QuanLiu, ShuainanCao, HuiJi, WenmingLi, CainaHuan, YiLei, LeiFu, YaxinGao, XuefengLiu,

METHODS: Proteomic biomarkers were measured in baseline fasting plasma from 958 Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II participants whose baseline and, in those returning for follow-up (n = 764), Year 4 fundus photographs were graded for DR presence/severity. The performance of PromarkerD (three biomarkers and readily available clinical variables which identify prevalent DKD and predict incident DKD and estimated glomerular filtration rate decline ≥30% over four years) for detecting DR prevalence, progression and incidence was assessed using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Logistic regression determined whether individual proteins were associated with DR outcomes after adjusting for the most parsimonious model. RESULTS: Plasma apolipoprotein A-IV (APOA4) was independently associated with moderate non-proliferative DR at baseline (OR (95% CI): 1.64 (1.01, 2.67), P = 0.047). Model discrimination was poor for all PromarkerD predicted probabilities against all DR outcomes (AUC ≤0.681). CONCLUSIONS: PromarkerD and its constituent biomarkers were not consistently associated with DR prevalence or temporal change. APOA4 was associated with prevalent DR, but not DR incidence or progression. Distinct pathophysiological mechanisms may underlie DKD and DR.","Drinkwater, Jocelyn JPeters, KirstenDavis, Wendy ATurner, Angus WBringans, Scott DLipscombe, Richard JDavis, Timothy M E","Drinkwater JJPeters KDavis WATurner AWBringans SDLipscombe RJDavis TME","Medical School, University of Western Australia, Fremantle Hospital, Fremantle, Western Australia, Australia.Medical School, University of Western Australia, Fremantle Hospital, Fremantle, Western Australia, Australia; Proteomics International, PO Box 3008, Broadway, Nedlands, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.Medical School, University of Western Australia, Fremantle Hospital, Fremantle, Western Australia, Australia.Lions Eye Institute, Nedlands, Western Australia, Australia; Centre for Ophthalmology and Visual Science, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Western Australia, Australia.Proteomics International, PO Box 3008, Broadway, Nedlands, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.Proteomics International, PO Box 3008, Broadway, Nedlands, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.Medical School, University of Western Australia, Fremantle Hospital, Fremantle, Western Australia, Australia.

We investigated the potential role of plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) in relation to these processes. Plasma EVs were isolated by size exclusion chromatography in fasting individuals with HIV and T2D (n = 16), T2D only (n = 14), HIV only (n = 20) or healthy controls (n = 19), and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, western blot, nanoparticle tracking analysis and quantitative proteomics. The findings were compared to gut microbiota alterations, lipopolysaccharide levels and cardiovascular risk profile. Individuals with concomitant HIV and T2D had higher plasma EV concentration, which correlated closely with plasma lipopolysaccharides, triglycerides and Framingham score, but not with gut microbiota alterations. Proteomic analyses identified 558 human proteins, largely related to cardiometabolic disease genes and upstream regulation of inflammatory pathways, including IL-6 and IL-1β, as well as 30 bacterial proteins, mostly from lipopolysaccharide-producing Proteobacteria. Our study supports that EVs are related to microbial translocation processes in individuals with HIV and T2D. Their proteomic content suggests a contributing role in low-grade inflammation and cardiovascular risk development. The present approach for exploring gut-host crosstalk can potentially identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","Vestad, BeateNyman, Tuula AHove-Skovsgaard, MaleneStensland, MariaHoel, HeddaTrøseid, Anne-Marie SiebkeAspelin, TrudeAass, Hans Christian DPuhka, MaijaHov, Johannes RNielsen, Susanne DamØvstebø, ReidunTrøseid, Marius","Vestad BNyman TAHove-Skovsgaard MStensland MHoel HTrøseid ASAspelin TAass HCDPuhka MHov JRNielsen SDØvstebø RTrøseid M","Research Institute of Internal Medicine, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Postboks 4590, 0424, Oslo, Norway. beate.vestad@medisin.uio.no.Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. beate.vestad@medisin.uio.no.Norwegian Society for Extracellular Vesicles, NOR-EV, Oslo, Norway. beate.vestad@medisin.uio.no.Department of Immunology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Copenhagen Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.Department of Immunology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.Research Institute of Internal Medicine, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Postboks 4590, 0424, Oslo, Norway.Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.Medical Department, Lovisenberg Diaconal Hospital, Oslo, Norway.Norwegian Society for Extracellular Vesicles, NOR-EV, Oslo, Norway.The Blood Cell Research Group, Department of Medical Biochemistry, Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål, Oslo, Norway.Norwegian Society for Extracellular Vesicles, NOR-EV, Oslo, Norway.The Blood Cell Research Group, Department of Medical Biochemistry, Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål, Oslo, Norway.Norwegian Society for Extracellular Vesicles, NOR-EV, Oslo, Norway.The Blood Cell Research Group, Department of Medical Biochemistry, Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål, Oslo, Norway.Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland FIMM, EV and HiPrep Cores, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.Research Institute of Internal Medicine, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Postboks 4590, 0424, Oslo, Norway.Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.Division of Surgery, Inflammatory Medicine and Transplantation, Norwegian PSC Research Center and Section of Gastroenterology, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital of Copenhagen Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.Norwegian Society for Extracellular Vesicles, NOR-EV, Oslo, Norway.The Blood Cell Research Group, Department of Medical Biochemistry, Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål, Oslo, Norway.Research Institute of Internal Medicine, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Postboks 4590, 0424, Oslo, Norway.Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.Section of Clinical Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.","eng","2016004/Helse Sør-Øst RHF/295910/Research Council of Norway INFRASTRUKTUR-program/","Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20211109","England","Sci Rep","Scientific reports","101563288",NA,"IM","Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiologyCase-Control StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/complicationsExtracellular Vesicles/*metabolismFemaleGastrointestinal MicrobiomeHIV Infections/*blood/complicationsHumansMaleMicroscopy, Electron, TransmissionMiddle AgedRisk Factors","PMC8578564",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare no competing interests.","2021/11/11 06:00","2022/01/29 06:00","2021/11/09","2021/11/10 06:13","2021/05/31 00:00 [received]2021/10/22 00:00 [accepted]2021/11/10 06:13 [entrez]2021/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]2022/01/29 06:00 [medline]2021/11/09 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1038/s41598-021-01334-y [pii]1334 [pii]10.1038/s41598-021-01334-y [doi]","epublish","Sci Rep. 2021 Nov 9;11(1):21936. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-01334-y.","© 2021.

Histological features of 322 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients with biopsy-confirmed diabetic nephropathy (DN) were retrospectively analysed. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for ESRD. Single glomerular proteomics and immunohistochemistry were used to identify differentially expressed proteins and enriched pathways in glomeruli. During the median follow-up period of 24 months, 144 (45%) patients progressed to ESRD. In multivariable models, the Renal Pathology Society classification failed to predict ESRD, although the solidified glomerulosclerosis (score 1: HR 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-2.60; score 2: HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.40-4.37) and extracapillary hypercellularity (HR 2.68, 95% CI 1.55-4.62) were identified as independent risk factors. Additionally, single glomerular proteomics, combined with immunohistochemistry, revealed that complement C9 and apolipoprotein E were highly expressed in solidified glomerulosclerosis. Therefore, solidified glomerulosclerosis and extracapillary hypercellularity predict diabetic ESRD in Chinese patients. Single glomerular proteomics identified solidified glomerulosclerosis as a unique pathological change that may be associated with complement overactivation and abnormal lipid metabolism.","Zhao, LijunLiu, FangLi, LinZhang, JunlinWang, TingliZhang, RuiZhang, WeiYang, XiaoyanZeng, XiaoxiWang, YitingWu, YuchengYang, HaoWang, ShishengZhong, YiXu, HuanWang, ShanshanGuo, RuikunRen, HonghongYang, LichuanSu, BaihaiZhang, JieTong, NanweiZhou, Xin JCooper, Mark E","Zhao LLiu FLi LZhang JWang TZhang RZhang WYang XZeng XWang YWu YYang HWang SZhong YXu HWang SGuo RRen HYang LSu BZhang JTong NZhou XJCooper ME","Division of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.Division of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China. liufangfh@163.com.Division of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.Division of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.Division of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.Division of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.West China Biomedical Big Data Center, West China Hospital/ West China School of Medicine of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.West China Biomedical Big Data Center, West China Hospital/ West China School of Medicine of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.West China Biomedical Big Data Center, West China Hospital/ West China School of Medicine of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.Division of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.Division of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.Key Laboratory of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, Ministry of Health, Regenerative Medicine Research Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.West China-Washington Mitochondria and Metabolism Research Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.West China-Washington Mitochondria and Metabolism Research Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.West China-Washington Mitochondria and Metabolism Research Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.Division of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.Division of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.Division of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.Division of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.Division of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.Division of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, No. 37, Guoxue Alley, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.Key Laboratory of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, Ministry of Health, Regenerative Medicine Research Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.Division of Endocrinology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.Department of Pathology, Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA.Department of Diabetes, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20210225","England","Sci Rep","Scientific reports","101563288",NA,"IM","AdolescentAdultChildChild, PreschoolChinaDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complicationsFemaleHumansKidney Failure, Chronic/*complicationsMalePrognosisProportional Hazards ModelsProteomics/*methodsSurvival AnalysisYoung Adult","PMC7907371",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare no competing interests.","2021/02/27 06:00","2021/12/21 06:00","2021/02/25","2021/02/26 05:56","2020/04/07 00:00 [received]2021/02/09 00:00 [accepted]2021/02/26 05:56 [entrez]2021/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]2021/12/21 06:00 [medline]2021/02/25 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1038/s41598-021-83856-z [pii]83856 [pii]10.1038/s41598-021-83856-z [doi]","epublish","Sci Rep. 2021 Feb 25;11(1):4658. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-83856-z.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/s41598-021-83856-z",NA,2021

However, most metabolomic studies are limited to an analysis of plasma metabolites under fasting conditions, rather than the dynamic shift in response to a metabolic challenge. Moreover, metabolomic profiles of peripheral tissues involved in glucose homeostasis are scarce and the transcriptomic regulation of genes involved in BCAA catabolism is partially unknown. This study aimed to identify differences in circulating and skeletal muscle BCAA levels in response to an OGTT in individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) or type 2 diabetes. Additionally, transcription factors involved in the regulation of the BCAA gene set were identified. METHODS: Plasma and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained from individuals with NGT or type 2 diabetes before and after an OGTT. Plasma and quadriceps muscles were harvested from skeletal muscle-specific Ppargc1a knockout and transgenic mice. BCAA-related metabolites and genes were assessed by LC-MS/MS and quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Small interfering RNA and adenovirus-mediated overexpression techniques were used in primary human skeletal muscle cells to study the role of PPARGC1A and ESRRA in the expression of the BCAA gene set. Radiolabelled leucine was used to analyse the impact of oestrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) knockdown on leucine oxidation. RESULTS: Impairments in BCAA catabolism in people with type 2 diabetes under fasting conditions were exacerbated after a glucose load. Branched-chain keto acids were reduced 37-56% after an OGTT in the NGT group, whereas no changes were detected in individuals with type 2 diabetes. These changes were concomitant with a stronger correlation with glucose homeostasis biomarkers and downregulated expression of branched-chain amino acid transaminase 2, branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex subunits and 69% of downstream BCAA-related genes in skeletal muscle. In primary human myotubes overexpressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α, encoded by PPARGC1A), 61% of the analysed BCAA genes were upregulated, while 67% were downregulated in the quadriceps of skeletal muscle-specific Ppargc1a knockout mice. ESRRA (encoding ERRα) silencing completely abrogated the PGC-1α-induced upregulation of BCAA-related genes in primary human myotubes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Metabolic inflexibility in type 2 diabetes impacts BCAA homeostasis and attenuates the decrease in circulating and skeletal muscle BCAA-related metabolites after a glucose challenge. Transcriptional regulation of BCAA genes in primary human myotubes via PGC-1α is ERRα-dependent.","Sjögren, Rasmus J ORizo-Roca, DavidChibalin, Alexander VChorell, ElinFurrer, RegulaKatayama, ShintaroHarada, JunKarlsson, Håkan K RHandschin, ChristophMoritz, ThomasKrook, AnnaNäslund, ErikZierath, Juleen R","Sjögren RJORizo-Roca DChibalin AVChorell EFurrer RKatayama SHarada JKarlsson HKRHandschin CMoritz TKrook ANäslund EZierath JRAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6891-7497","Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Integrative Physiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Integrative Physiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Integrative Physiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden.Biozentrum, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.Cardiovascular-Metabolics Research Laboratories, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Integrative Physiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Biozentrum, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.Swedish Metabolomics Centre, Department of Forest Genetics and Plant Physiology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umeå, Sweden.Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Integrative Physiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Division of Surgery, Department of Clinical Sciences, Danderyd Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Integrative Physiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. juleen.zierath@ki.se.Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Integrative Physiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. juleen.zierath@ki.se.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20210616","Germany","Diabetologia","Diabetologia","0006777","0 (Amino Acids, Branched-Chain)0 (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha)0 (Receptors, Estrogen)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IM","Amino Acids, Branched-Chain/metabolismAnimalsChromatography, Liquid*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/genetics/metabolismGlucose/metabolismHumansMiceMuscle Fibers, Skeletal/metabolismMuscle, Skeletal/metabolismPeroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha/genetics/metabolismReceptors, EstrogenTandem Mass SpectrometryERRalpha Estrogen-Related Receptor","PMC8382616",NA,"NOTNLM","Branched-chain amino acidOestrogen-related receptor αOral glucose tolerance testPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-αSkeletal muscleType 2 diabetes",NA,"2021/06/17 06:00","2022/04/01 06:00","2021/06/16","2021/06/16 06:55","2021/01/17 00:00 [received]2021/03/12 00:00 [accepted]2021/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]2022/04/01 06:00 [medline]2021/06/16 06:55 [entrez]2021/06/16 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1007/s00125-021-05481-9 [pii]5481 [pii]10.1007/s00125-021-05481-9 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetologia. 2021 Sep;64(9):2077-2091. doi: 10.1007/s00125-021-05481-9.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the success rates between patients with and without T2DM during the healing period at our center. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were cultured from subjects. Proteomics was used to detect differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) among the DM failure (DM-F), DM success (DM-S), and control (Con) groups. The correlation between the expression levels of nine target DEPs and medium glucose concentrations was investigated. RESULTS: Higher failure rates were observed in the T2DM patients. Fifty-two DEPs were found between the DM-F and DM-S groups. Seventy-three DEPs were found between the DM-F and Con groups. Forty-three DEPs were found between the DM-S and Con groups. Five target DEPs were expressed at the same levels in the medium with different glucose concentrations. Gene ontology annotation and functional enrichment analysis suggest that the DEPs detected in the DM-F group may affect the biological function and regulatory potential of BMSCs. CONCLUSIONS: The DEPs detected in the DM-F group can be intervention targets for to prevent implant failure in T2DM patients.

In this study, we sought to identify possible metabolites related to diabetic nephropathy among urinary eicosanoids and related mediators. Using liquid chromatogram-tandem mass spectrometry, we optimized the lipid extraction from urine using the Monospin C18 as a solid-phase extraction cartridge and measured the urinary lipid mediators in 111 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as 33 healthy subjects. We observed that 14 metabolites differed significantly among the clinical stages of nephropathy. Among them, levels of tetranor-prostaglandin E metabolite (tetranor-PGEM), an arachidonic acid metabolite, were significantly higher in subjects with stage 1 nephropathy than in healthy subjects and increased with the progression of nephropathy. We also observed that levels of maresin-1, a docosahexaenoic acid metabolite, and leukotriene B4-ethanolamide, an arachidonoyl ethanolamide metabolite, were significantly lower in subjects with stage 3-4 nephropathy than in healthy subjects and those with stage 1-2 nephropathy. Finally, using a comprehensive analysis of urinary eicosanoids and related mediators, we concluded that tetranor-PGEM was capable of discriminating clinical stages of nephropathy and thus useful as a novel biomarker for diabetic nephropathy.","Morita, YoshifumiKurano, MakotoSakai, EriSawabe, MotojiAoki, JunkenYatomi, Yutaka","Morita YKurano MSakai ESawabe MAoki JYatomi Y","Department of Clinical Laboratory, University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Molecular Pathology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.Department of Clinical Laboratory, University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

Insulin is not only involved in carbohydrate metabolism, it also regulates protein synthesis. This work describes the expression of proteins in the liver of a diabetic mouse and identifies the metabolic pathways involved. Twenty-week-old diabetic db/db mice were hepatectomized, after which proteins were separated by 2D-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Spots varying in intensity were analyzed using mass spectrometry, and biological function was assigned by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) software. A differential expression of 26 proteins was identified; among these were arginase-1, pyruvate carboxylase, peroxiredoxin-1, regucalcin, and sorbitol dehydrogenase. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that many of these proteins are mitochondrial and participate in metabolic pathways, such as the citrate cycle, the fructose and mannose metabolism, and glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. In addition, these proteins are related to oxidation⁻reduction reactions and molecular function of vitamin binding and amino acid metabolism. In conclusion, the proteomic profile of the liver of diabetic mouse db/db exhibited mainly alterations in the metabolism of carbohydrates and nitrogen. These differences illustrate the heterogeneity of diabetes in its different stages and under different conditions and highlights the need to improve treatments for this disease.","Guzmán-Flores, Juan ManuelFlores-Pérez, Elsa CristinaHernández-Ortiz, MagdalenaVargas-Ortiz, KatyaRamírez-Emiliano, JoelEncarnación-Guevara, SergioPérez-Vázquez, Victoriano","Guzmán-Flores JMFlores-Pérez ECHernández-Ortiz MVargas-Ortiz KRamírez-Emiliano JEncarnación-Guevara SPérez-Vázquez V","Departamento de Ciencias Médicas, División de Ciencias de la Salud, Campus León, Universidad de Guanajuato, León, Guanajuato 37320, Mexico. juan.guzman@cualtos.udg.mx.Departamento de Clínicas, División de Ciencias Biomédicas, Centro Universitario de los Altos, Universidad de Guadalajara, Tepatitlán, Jalisco 47600, Mexico. juan.guzman@cualtos.udg.mx.Departamento de Ciencias Médicas, División de Ciencias de la Salud, Campus León, Universidad de Guanajuato, León, Guanajuato 37320, Mexico. elsi28@hotmal.com.Centro de Ciencias Genómicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Cuernavaca, Morelos 62210, Mexico. magdini@gmail.com.Departamento de Ciencias Médicas, División de Ciencias de la Salud, Campus León, Universidad de Guanajuato, León, Guanajuato 37320, Mexico. kavati75@hotmail.com.Departamento de Ciencias Médicas, División de Ciencias de la Salud, Campus León, Universidad de Guanajuato, León, Guanajuato 37320, Mexico. joelre@ugto.com.Centro de Ciencias Genómicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Cuernavaca, Morelos 62210, Mexico. encarnac@ccg.unam.mx.Departamento de Ciencias Médicas, División de Ciencias de la Salud, Campus León, Universidad de Guanajuato, León, Guanajuato 37320, Mexico. vpvazquez@ugto.mx.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20180601","Switzerland","Biomolecules","Biomolecules","101596414","0 (Proteome)","IM","AnimalsDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*metabolismLiver/*metabolismMaleMetabolic Networks and PathwaysMiceProteome/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism","PMC6023011",NA,"NOTNLM","bioinformaticsdiabetesmouseobesityproteomics","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","2018/06/03 06:00","2019/05/30 06:00","2018/06/01","2018/06/03 06:00","2018/03/13 00:00 [received]2018/05/27 00:00 [revised]2018/05/29 00:00 [accepted]2018/06/03 06:00 [entrez]2018/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]2019/05/30 06:00 [medline]2018/06/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","biom8020035 [pii]biomolecules-08-00035 [pii]10.3390/biom8020035 [doi]","epublish","Biomolecules. 2018 Jun 1;8(2):35. doi: 10.3390/biom8020035.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/biom8020035",NA,2018

A gelsolin isoform is secreted into the plasma as part of the extracellular actin scavenger system which serves a protective role by digesting and removing actin filaments released from damaged cells. Recent data indicate a role for decreased plasma gelsolin (pGSN) levels as a biomarker of inflammatory conditions. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), a heterogeneous group of cell-derived membranous structures involved in intercellular signaling, have been implicated in metabolic and inflammatory diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus. We examined whether pGSN levels were associated with EV concentration and inflammatory plasma proteins in individuals with or without diabetes. METHODS: We quantified pGSN longitudinally (n = 104) in a socioeconomically diverse cohort of middle-aged African American and White study participants with and without diabetes mellitus. Plasma gelsolin levels were assayed by ELISA. EV concentration (sub-cohort n = 40) was measured using nanoparticle tracking analysis. Inflammatory plasma proteins were assayed on the SomaScan® v4 proteomic platform. RESULTS: pGSN levels were lower in men than women. White individuals with diabetes had significantly lower levels of pGSN compared to White individuals without diabetes and to African American individuals either with or without diabetes. For adults living below poverty, those with diabetes had lower pGSN levels than those without diabetes. Adults living above poverty had similar pGSN levels regardless of diabetes status. No correlation between EV concentrations and pGSN levels was identified (r = - 0.03; p = 0.85). Large-scale exploratory plasma protein proteomics revealed 47 proteins that significantly differed by diabetes status, 19 of which significantly correlated with pGSN levels, including adiponectin. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of racially diverse individuals with and without diabetes, we found differences in pGSN levels with diabetes status, sex, race, and poverty. We also report significant associations of pGSN with the adipokine, adiponectin, and other inflammation and diabetes-related proteins. These data provide mechanistic insights into the relationship of pGSN and diabetes.","Noren Hooten, NicoleMode, Nicolle AKowalik, EdwardOmoniyi, VictorZonderman, Alan BEzike, NgoziDiNubile, Mark JLevinson, Susan LEvans, Michele K","Noren Hooten NAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1683-3838Mode NAKowalik EOmoniyi VZonderman ABEzike NDiNubile MJLevinson SLEvans MKAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8546-2831","Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, NIH Biomedical Research Center, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, NIH Biomedical Research Center, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.BioAegis Therapeutics, North Brunswick, NJ, USA.Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, NIH Biomedical Research Center, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, NIH Biomedical Research Center, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, NIH Biomedical Research Center, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA.BioAegis Therapeutics, North Brunswick, NJ, USA.BioAegis Therapeutics, North Brunswick, NJ, USA.Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, NIH Biomedical Research Center, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD, 21224, USA. me42v@nih.gov.","eng","AG000513/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesAG000519/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., Intramural","20230310","England","J Transl Med","Journal of translational medicine","101190741","0 (Gelsolin)0 (Adiponectin)0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Proteins)","IM","MaleAdultMiddle AgedHumansFemale*Gelsolin*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2AdiponectinProteomicsInflammationBiomarkersBlood Proteins","PMC9999548",NA,"NOTNLM","African AmericanDiabetes mellitusExtracellular vesicles (EV)InflammationPovertyRaceSexSocial determinants of healthpGSN","EK, SLL and MJD are employed by and own stock in BioAegis Therapeutics, which is developing recombinant human plasma gelsolin for clinical use.

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed HDL-bound proteins in patients with NAFLD with or without advanced fibrosis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study at a university hospital included 185 patients with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D). Patients underwent liver proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure intrahepatic triglyceride accumulation and those with NAFLD underwent a percutaneous liver biopsy. Advanced lipid testing with lipoprotein subfraction measurements and targeted proteomics of HDL-bound proteins was performed. RESULTS: Patients with and without advanced fibrosis had similar clinical characteristics, except for lower HDL-C (34 ± 8 vs 38 ± 9 mg/dL, P = 0.024) and higher prevalence of T2D in advanced fibrosis. Patients with advanced fibrosis had lower HDL particle number. A panel of 28 HDL-bound proteins were targeted and quantified by multiple reaction monitoring liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Five proteins were found to be decreased in patients with advanced fibrosis (ApoC-I [P < 0.001], ApoC-IV [P = 0.012], ApoM [P = 0.008], LCAT [P = 0.014], and SAA4 [P = 0.016]). No differences were observed in these proteins in patients with vs without NAFLD or steatohepatitis. The pCAD index, associated with coronary artery disease and cardiovascular mortality, was significantly higher in patients with advanced fibrosis (97 ± 5 vs 86 ± 25, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Patients with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis showed significant differences in HDL-bound protein levels; this translated into increased cardiovascular risk based on pCAD index. Different lipoprotein composition and function may explain the link between liver disease and increased cardiovascular mortality in these patients.","Bril, FernandoPearce, Ryan WCollier, Timothy SMcPhaul, Michael J","Bril FAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5570-4396Pearce RWCollier TSMcPhaul MJAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4399-5733","Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233, USA.Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Birmingham VA Medical Center, Birmingham, AL 35233, USA.Quest Diagnostics Cardiometabolic Center of Excellence, Cleveland HeartLab, Cleveland, OH 44103, USA.Quest Diagnostics Cardiometabolic Center of Excellence, Cleveland HeartLab, Cleveland, OH 44103, USA.Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675, USA.","eng","UL1 TR001427/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"United States","J Clin Endocrinol Metab","The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism","0375362","0 (Lipoproteins)0 (Apolipoproteins)0 (Apolipoproteins C)","IM","Humans*Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/complications/pathology*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complicationsCross-Sectional StudiesLiver Cirrhosis/pathologyLiver/pathologyLipoproteinsApolipoproteins*Cardiovascular Diseases/pathologyApolipoproteins CBiopsy","PMC9759171",NA,"NOTNLM","NAFLDNASHcholesterolcirrhosisdyslipidemia",NA,"2022/09/30 06:00","2022/12/21 06:00","2023/09/29","2022/09/29 14:03","2022/05/06 00:00 [received]2022/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]2022/12/21 06:00 [medline]2022/09/29 14:03 [entrez]2023/09/29 00:00 [pmc-release]","6731241 [pii]dgac565 [pii]10.1210/clinem/dgac565 [doi]","ppublish","J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2022 Dec 17;108(1):42-51. doi: 10.1210/clinem/dgac565.","© The Author(s) 2022.

Poor lifestyle choices and excessive intake of ""cheap calories"" are major contributors to obesity, triggering type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and other comorbidities. Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for development of obesity is essential as it might result in the introducing of anti-obesity targets and early-stage obesity biomarkers, allowing the distinction between metabolic syndromes. The complex nature of this disease, coupled with the phenomenon of metabolically healthy obesity, inspired us to perform data-centric, hypothesis-generating pilot research, aimed to find correlations between parameters of classic clinical blood tests and proteomic profiles of 104 lean and obese subjects. As the result, we assembled patterns of proteins, which presence or absence allows predicting the weight of the patient fairly well. We believe that such proteomic patterns with high prediction power should facilitate the translation of potential candidates into biomarkers of clinical use for early-stage stratification of obesity therapy.","Kiseleva, Olga IArzumanian, Viktoriia APoverennaya, Ekaterina VPyatnitskiy, Mikhail AIlgisonis, Ekaterina VZgoda, Victor GPlotnikova, Oksana ASharafetdinov, Khaider KLisitsa, Andrey VTutelyan, Victor ANikityuk, Dmitry BArchakov, Alexander IPonomarenko, Elena A","Kiseleva OIArzumanian VAPoverennaya EVPyatnitskiy MAIlgisonis EVZgoda VGPlotnikova OASharafetdinov KKLisitsa AVTutelyan VANikityuk DBArchakov AIPonomarenko EA","Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Pogodinskaya Street 10/8, 119121 Moscow, Russia.Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Pogodinskaya Street 10/8, 119121 Moscow, Russia.Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Pogodinskaya Street 10/8, 119121 Moscow, Russia.Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Pogodinskaya Street 10/8, 119121 Moscow, Russia.Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Pogodinskaya Street 10/8, 119121 Moscow, Russia.Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, Pogodinskaya Street 10/8, 119121 Moscow, Russia.Federal Research Centre of Nutrition, Biotechnology and Food Safety, Russian Academy of Sciences, Ustinsky Passage 2/14, 109240 Moscow, Russia.Federal Research Centre of Nutrition, Biotechnology and Food Safety, Russian Academy of Sciences, Ustinsky Passage 2/14, 109240 Moscow, Russia.Russian Medical Academy of Continuing Professional Education, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Barrikadnaya Street 2/1, 125993 Moscow, Russia.I.M.

METHODS: In 2467 individuals of the population-based, cross-sectional EpiHealth study (45-75 years, 50% women), 249 plasma proteins were analysed by the proximity extension assay technique. DNA was genotyped using the Illumina HumanCoreExome-12 v1.0 BeadChip. Diabetes was defined as taking glucose-lowering treatment or having a fasting plasma glucose of ≥7.0 mmol/l. The associations between proteins and diabetes were assessed using logistic regression. To investigate causal relationships between proteins and diabetes, a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomisation was performed based on large, genome-wide association studies belonging to the DIAGRAM and MAGIC consortia, and a genome-wide association study in the EpiHealth study. RESULTS: Twenty-six proteins were positively associated with diabetes, including cathepsin D, retinal dehydrogenase 1, α-L-iduronidase, hydroxyacid oxidase 1 and galectin-4 (top five findings). Three proteins, lipoprotein lipase, IGF-binding protein 2 and paraoxonase 3 (PON-3), were inversely associated with diabetes. Fourteen of the proteins are novel discoveries. The Mendelian randomisation study did not disclose any significant causal effects between the proteins and diabetes in either direction that were consistent with the relationships found between the protein levels and diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The 29 proteins associated with diabetes are involved in several physiological pathways, but given the power of the study no causal link was identified for those proteins tested in Mendelian randomisation. Therefore, the identified proteins are likely to be biomarkers for type 2 diabetes, rather than representing causal pathways.","Beijer, KristinaNowak, ChristophSundström, JohanÄrnlöv, JohanFall, ToveLind, Lars","Beijer KNowak CSundström JÄrnlöv JFall TLind L","Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, UCR, Dag Hammarskjölds väg 38, SE-751 83, Uppsala, Sweden.

Dissecting the specific metabolic changes induced by disease through metabolomics has shown potential to improve our understanding of relevant pathophysiological mechanisms of disease, which could lead to improved treatment. Targeted tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to compare amine and acylcarnitine levels in plasma samples of patients with TB or TB-DM from Indonesia at time of diagnosis and during antibiotic treatment. Partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) showed good separation of patient groups. Amine levels were strongly altered in both disease groups compared to healthy controls, including low concentrations of citrulline and ornithine. Several amino acid ratios discriminated TB from controls (phenylalanine/histidine; citrulline/arginine; kynurenine/tryptophan), possibly reflecting changes in indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. Choline, glycine, serine, threonine and homoserine levels were lower in TB-DM compared to TB, and, in contrast to other analytes, did not normalize to healthy control levels during antibiotic treatment. Our results not only provide important validation of previous studies but also identify novel biomarkers, and significantly enhance our understanding of metabolic changes in human TB and TB-DM.","Vrieling, FrankAlisjahbana, BachtiSahiratmadja, Edhyanavan Crevel, ReinoutHarms, Amy CHankemeier, ThomasOttenhoff, Tom H MJoosten, Simone A","Vrieling FAlisjahbana BSahiratmadja Evan Crevel RHarms ACAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2931-4295Hankemeier TOttenhoff THMJoosten SA","Department of Infectious Diseases, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.Department of Internal Medicine, Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Bandung, Indonesia.Infectious Disease Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran, Bandung, Indonesia.Infectious Disease Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran, Bandung, Indonesia.Department of Internal Medicine and Radboud Center for Infectious Diseases, Radboud Institute for Health Sciences (RIHS), Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.Systems Biomedicine and Pharmacology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.Systems Biomedicine and Pharmacology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.Department of Infectious Diseases, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.Department of Infectious Diseases, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.

However, scarce information is currently available on the association between distinct plasma ceramides (that have been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality) and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a group of individuals at high risk of developing CVD and other chronic inflammation-related conditions. METHODS: We measured six previously identified high-risk plasma ceramide species [Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer(d18:1/20:0), Cer(d18:1/22:0), Cer(d18:1/24:0), Cer(d18:1/24:1)] in 92 postmenopausal women with T2DM attending the diabetes outpatient service over a 3-month period. Plasma ceramide levels were measured using targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay. RESULTS: Plasma hs-CRP levels were positively associated with all measured ceramides in univariable linear regression analyses. However, only plasma Cer(d18:1/16:0) (standard β coefficient: 0.27, P=0.015), Cer(d18:1/22:0) (standard β coefficient: 0.25, P=0.032) and Cer(d18:1/24:1) (standard β coefficient: 0.30, P=0.007) remained significantly associated with increased plasma hs-CRP levels after adjusting for age, adiposity measures, diabetes duration, HbA(1c), insulin resistance, smoking, hypertension, plasma LDL cholesterol, estimated glomerular filtration rate, preexisting ischaemic heart disease and use of lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, antiplatelet or hypoglycaemic drugs. CONCLUSION: In postmenopausal women with T2DM, elevated levels of specific plasma ceramides are associated with higher plasma hs-CRP levels independent of established cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes-related variables and other potential confounding factors.","Mantovani, AAltomari, ALunardi, GBonapace, SLippi, GBonnet, FTargher, G","Mantovani AAltomari ALunardi GBonapace SLippi GBonnet FTargher G","Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, Verona, Italy.

In this research, a flow injection tandem mass spectrometry (FI-MS/MS) method for simultaneous measurement of AAs and acylcarnitines in addition to results of validation is explained. METHODS: Samples were mixed with internal standards and after derivatization (with butanolic-HCL), AAs, and acylcarnitines were quantified by tandem mass spectrometry (SCIEX API 3200). Analytical performance studies were designed based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines including precision, accuracy, linearity, and limit of detection-quantification (LOD-LOQ) experiments. Samples from patients with T2D in different stages of kidney disease were also analyzed to ensure the clinical usage of the method. RESULTS: Performance evaluation of the method demonstrated adequate results. The mean of estimated inter-assay precision (reported as a coefficient variation) for AAs and acylcarnitines were less than 8.7% and 12.3%, the estimated mean bias was below 8.8% and 10.2% respectively. LOD of analytes ranged between 0.6-10 μmol per liter (μmol/L) for AAs and 0.02-1 μmol/L for acylcarnitines. LOQ analytes showed a range of 2-25 μmol/L and 0.05-5 μmol/L for AAs and carnitine/acylcarnitines respectively. In diabetic patients sample analysis, a significant increase in acylcarnitines (C2, C4, C5DC, C6, C8, C10, C14) and citrulline with a significant decrease in valine were seen in patients with severely increased albuminuria. CONCLUSION: FI-MS/MS method with pre-injection derivatization with butanolic-HCL can be used for concurrent measurement of AAs and carnitine/acylcarnitines in a short time and it satisfies the analytical performance requirements. This method is applied for AAs and carnitine/acylcarnitines measurement in patient with T2DM and results show some of the acylcarnitines and AAs can be involved in diabetic nephropathy development.

We adapted the SCoPE method from single-cell proteomics to pericardial fluid, where a myocardial tissue carrier was used to aid protein quantification. The carrier proteome and patient samples were labeled with distinct isobaric labels, which allowed separate quantification. Undepleted pericardial fluid from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or heart failure undergoing heart surgery was analyzed with either a traditional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method or with the carrier proteome. In total, 1398 proteins were quantified with a carrier, compared to 265 without, and a higher proportion of these proteins were of myocardial origin. The number of differentially expressed proteins also increased nearly four-fold. For patients with both heart failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus, pathway analysis of upregulated proteins demonstrated the enrichment of immune activation, blood coagulation, and stress pathways. Overall, our work demonstrates the applicability of a carrier for enhanced protein quantification in challenging biological matrices such as pericardial fluid, with potential applications for biomarker discovery.

The study aimed to determine the impact of these DRGs on the biological pathways and networks that are related to the associated disorders and complications in T2DM and to predict its role as prospective biomarkers. METHODS: Datasets obtained from metabolomic and proteomic profiling were used for investigation of the differential expression of the genes. A subset of DRGs was integrated into IPA software to explore its biological pathways, related diseases, and their regulation in T2DM. Upon entry into the IPA, only 94 of the DRGs were recognizable, mapped, and matched within the database. RESULTS: The study identified networks that explore the dysregulation of several functions; cell components such as degranulation of cells; molecular transport process and metabolism of cellular proteins; and inflammatory responses. Top disorders associated with DRGs in T2DM are related to organ injuries such as renal damage, connective tissue disorders, and acute inflammatory disorders. Upstream regulator analysis predicted the role of several transcription factors of interest, such as STAT3 and HIF alpha, as well as many kinases such as JAK kinases, which affects the gene expression of the dataset in T2DM. Interleukin 6 (IL6) is the top regulator of the DRGs, followed by leptin (LEP). Monitoring the dysregulation of the coupled expression of the following biomarkers (TNF, IL6, LEP, AGT, APOE, F2, SPP1, and INS) highlights that they could be used as potential prognostic biomarkers. CONCLUSION: The integration of data obtained by advanced metabolomic and proteomic technologies has made it probable to advantage in understanding the role of these biomarkers in the identification of significant biological processes, pathways, and regulators that are associated with T2DM and its comorbidities.","Cheema, Amrita KKaur, PrabhjitFadel, AminaYounes, NouraZirie, MahmoudRizk, Nasser M","Cheema AKKaur PFadel AYounes NZirie MRizk NMAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6288-3609","Department of Oncology, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.Department of Oncology, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.Biomedical Sciences Department, College of Health Sciences and Biomedical Research Center, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.Clinical Chemistry Lab, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Endocrine Department, Hammad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Biomedical Sciences Department, College of Health Sciences and Biomedical Research Center, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.Physiology Department, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20200707","New Zealand","Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes","Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy","101515585",NA,NA,NA,"PMC7354282",NA,"NOTNLM","bioinformaticsbiomarkersdisorderspathway analysisregulatorstype 2 diabetes mellitus","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a conflict of interest.","2020/08/06 06:00","2020/08/06 06:01","2020/07/07","2020/08/06 06:00","2020/01/01 00:00 [received]2020/05/29 00:00 [accepted]2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]2020/08/06 06:01 [medline]2020/07/07 00:00 [pmc-release]","244432 [pii]10.2147/DMSO.S244432 [doi]","epublish","Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes. 2020 Jul 7;13:2409-2431. doi: 10.2147/DMSO.S244432. eCollection 2020.","© 2020 Cheema et al.",NA,NA,"10.2147/DMSO.S244432",NA,2020

The mechanisms underlying these improvements have so far not been elucidated fully. To further investigate the mechanisms of a VLCD with or without exercise and to uncover possible biomarkers associated with these interventions, blood samples were collected from 27 obese type 2 diabetes patients before and after a 16-week VLCD (Modifast ∼ 450 kcal/day). Thirteen of these patients followed an exercise program in addition to the VCLD. Plasma was obtained from 27 lean and 27 obese controls as well. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry (MS) and targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and a large scale isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) approach. After the 16-week VLCD, there was a significant decrease in body weight and HbA1c in all patients, without differences between the two intervention groups. Targeted MRM analysis revealed differences in several proteins, which could be divided in diabetes-associated (fibrinogen, transthyretin), obesity-associated (complement C3), and diet-associated markers (apolipoproteins, especially apolipoprotein A-IV). To further investigate the effects of exercise, large scale iTRAQ analysis was performed. However, no proteins were found showing an exercise effect. Thus, in this study, specific proteins were found to be differentially expressed in type 2 diabetes patients versus controls and before and after a VLCD. These proteins are potential disease state and intervention specific biomarkers.

The pathological events causing beta-cell dysfunctions are only poorly understood and early markers that would predict islet function are missing. In contrast to immunoassays, unbiased proteomic technologies provide the opportunity to screen for novel marker protein and peptides of T2DM. An important subset of the proteome, peptides and peptide hormones secreted by the pancreas are deregulated in T2DM. The mass range of peptides and small proteins (1-20 kDa) is only sufficiently targeted by peptidomics, a combination of liquid chromatographic and mass spectrometric (MS) peptide analysis. Here, we describe the application of isotope label-free quantitative peptidomics to display and quantify relevant changes in the level of pancreatic peptides and peptide hormones in a preclinical model of T2DM, the Lep(ob)/Lep(ob) mouse. The amino acid sequence of statistical relevant top candidates was determined by MS/MS fragmentation or Edman degradation. The comparison of lean versus obese mice revealed increased levels of islet-specific peptides that can be divided into the following categories 1) the major islet peptide hormones insulin, amylin and glucagon; 2) proinsulin and C-peptide and 3) novel processing products of secretogranin, glucagon and amylin. Furthermore, we found increased levels of proteins and peptides implicated in zymogen granule maturation (syncollin) and nutritional digestion. In summary, our findings demonstrate that peptidomics is a valid approach to screen for novel peptide biomarkers.","Budde, PetraSchulte, ImkeAppel, AnnetteNeitz, SusanneKellmann, MarkusTammen, HaraldHess, RüdigerRose, Horst","Budde PSchulte IAppel ANeitz SKellmann MTammen HHess RRose H","BioVisioN AG, Feodor-Lynen-Str. 5, D-30625 Hannover, Germany. p.budde@biovision-discovery.de","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"United Arab Emirates","Comb Chem High Throughput Screen","Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening","9810948","0 (Insulin)0 (Peptide Library)0 (Peptides)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IM","AnimalsCells, CulturedChromatography, High Pressure LiquidEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent AssayGlucose/metabolismInsulin/metabolismLipolysis/physiologyPeptide LibraryPeptides/*genetics/*physiology*ProteomicsRats",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2006/02/09 09:00","2006/03/08 09:00",NA,"2006/02/09 09:00","2006/02/09 09:00 [pubmed]2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]2006/02/09 09:00 [entrez]","10.2174/138620705774962535 [doi]","ppublish","Comb Chem High Throughput Screen. 2005 Dec;8(8):775-81. doi: 10.2174/138620705774962535.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2005

It is envisaged that identifying early biomarkers of immune aging would aid in identifying individuals at risk of age-related disease and would allow the discovery of novel intervention strategies. Proteomics has emerged as a rapidly expanding and innovative field, investigating protein expression, interaction and function at a global level. Several proteomic strategies, including use of mass spectrometry and non-mass spectrometry-based detection systems (including secondary antibody labeling with fluorescent tags) may be particularly advantageous in identifying biomarkers of immune health.

The ages of diabetes are decreasing, so ocular surface status in younger generations is worthy of attention. We used tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled proteomics and weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to identify differentially expressed proteins in the tear proteome of adults and children with diabetic DE. METHODS: Study subjects were divided into six groups of 10, including three groups each for adults and children. The adult groups included diabetics with DE (A), diabetics without DE (B), and normal controls (C); the corresponding groups of children were identified as (D), (E), and (F). DE tests were performed on all subjects. We extracted total proteins and labeled them with TMTs for analysis. WGCNA was used to recognize hub genes. RESULTS: Tear film function was poorer in patients with diabetic DE. In adults, 1922 proteins were identified, and WGCNA analysis revealed three hub genes related to diabetic DE. For children, 2709 proteins were identified, and WGCNA analysis identified one hub gene related to diabetic DE. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis found similarities among metabolic pathways involved in differential expression of proteins in adult and child tear samples. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of diabetic DE was highly similar in adults and children. The differentially expressed tear proteins in type 2 diabetes of adults and children was associated with inflammation, immune factors, and lipid metabolism. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Our findings found high similarities in the pathogenesis of diabetic DE in adults and children.","Zou, XinrongWang, ShanshanZhang, PeiLu, LinaZou, Haidong","Zou XWang SZhang PLu LZou H","Department of Preventative Ophthalmology, Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Center, Shanghai, China.Department of Ophthalmology, Fengcheng Hospital, Fengxian District, Shanghai, China.Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Department of Ophthalmology, Gonghui Hospital, Jingan District, Shanghai, China.Department of Preventative Ophthalmology, Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Center, Shanghai, China.Department of Preventative Ophthalmology, Shanghai Eye Disease Prevention and Treatment Center, Shanghai, China.Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20201204","United States","Transl Vis Sci Technol","Translational vision science & technology","101595919",NA,NA,"AdultChild*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/genetics*Dry Eye Syndromes/diagnosisHumansProteomicsTears","PMC7718812",NA,"NOTNLM","WGCNAadultschildrendiabetesdry eyetear proteomics","Disclosure: X.

Screening of plasma biomarkers has great significance of optimizing diagnosis and predicting the complications of T2DM. METHODS: We used a special diet, Purina #5008, to induce diabetes in Zucker leptin receptor gene-deficient rats (fa/fa) to establish Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats, simulating the early stage of T2DM. The differentially expressed proteins (DEP) and lipids (DEL), as potential biomarkers, were screened to compare the plasma expression levels in ZDF rats and their basic diet-fed wild-type controls (fa/+) by Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: These two groups had different plasma proteins and lipids profiles consisting of 84 DEPs and, 179 DELs identified in the positive ion mode and 178 DELs in the negative ion mode, respectively. Enrichment analysis of these different indicators showed that oxidative stress, insulin resistance and metabolic disorders of glycan and lipid played an important role in generating the difference. Some markers can be used as candidate biomarkers in prediction and treatments of T2DM, such as ceruloplasmin, apolipoprotein C-I, apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein C-IV. CONCLUSION: These plasma differences help to optimize the diagnosis and predict the complications of T2DM, although this remains to be verified in the crowd. Trace elements related-metalloproteins, such as ceruloplasmin, and lipid metabolism and transport-related apolipoprotein C are expected to be candidate biomarkers of T2DM and should be given more attention.","Wang, ShuaiLu, ZhiyuanWang, YuxinZhang, TianranHe, Xiaodong","Wang SLu ZWang YZhang THe XAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5903-6003","Institute of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012 Shandong China.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that strongly increases the risk of severe vascular diseases. This study compared changes in proteins of the cerebral cortex during ischemic brain injury between nondiabetic and diabetic animals. METHODS: Adult male rats were injected with streptozotocin (40 mg/kg) via the intraperitoneal route to induce diabetes and underwent surgical middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) 4 wk after streptozotocin treatment. Cerebral cortex tissues were collected 24 h after MCAO and cerebral cortex proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Several proteins were identified as differentially expressed between nondiabetic and diabetic animals. Among the identified proteins, we focused on the following metabolism-related enzymes: isocitrate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, adenosylhomocysteinase, pyruvate kinase, and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (neuroleukin). Expression of these proteins was decreased in animals that underwent MCAO. Moreover, protein expression was reduced to a greater extent in diabetic animals than in nondiabetic animals. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that the diabetic condition exacerbates the decrease in expression of metabolism-related proteins after MCAO. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the diabetic condition may exacerbate brain damage during focal cerebral ischemia through the downregulation of metabolism-related proteins.","Sung, Jin-HeeShah, Fawad-AliGim, Sang-AhKoh, Phil-Ok","Sung JHShah FAGim SAKoh PO","Department of Anatomy, College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute of Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, South Korea.Department of Anatomy, College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute of Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, South Korea.Department of Anatomy, College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute of Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, South Korea.Department of Anatomy, College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute of Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, South Korea.

However, it is unclear whether the metabolomic signature is associated with weight loss interventions in obese children with IR. Thirty-six obese children with IR were selected from the weight loss camp (Shenzhen Sunshine Xing Yada health Technology Co., LTD). Clinical parameters were collected before and after weight loss intervention. Targeted metabolomics of plasma samples was performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to the tandem mass spectrometry, and principal component analysis, variable importance in projection, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis were used to obtain the differentially expressed metabolites. Pathway analysis was conducted with the Homo sapiens (HSA) sets in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. We used machine learning algorithms to obtain the potential biomarkers and Spearman correlation analysis to clarify the association between potential biomarkers and clinical parameters. We found that clinical parameters and metabolite clusters were significantly changed in obese children with IR before and after weight loss intervention. Mechanistically, weight loss intervention significantly changed 61 metabolites in obese children with IR. Furthermore, 12 pathways were significantly changed. Moreover, the machine learning algorithm found 6 important potential biomarkers. In addition, these potential biomarkers were strongly associated with major clinical parameters. These data indicate different metabolomic profiles in obese children with IR after weight loss intervention, providing insights into the clinical parameters and metabolite mechanisms involved in weight loss programs.","Liu, XiaoguangZhu, LinLiu, JingxinNie, ZichenQiu, Wenjun","Liu XZhu LLiu JNie ZQiu W","School of Sport and Health, Guangzhou Sport University, Guangzhou, China.Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Physical Activity and Health Promotion, Guangzhou Sport University, Guangzhou, China.School of Sport and Health, Guangzhou Sport University, Guangzhou, China. 11251@gzsport.edu.cn.Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Physical Activity and Health Promotion, Guangzhou Sport University, Guangzhou, China. 11251@gzsport.edu.cn.Physical education and sports school, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China.Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240830","Austria","Amino Acids","Amino acids","9200312","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Humans*Insulin ResistanceChildMaleFemale*Metabolomics/methods*Weight Loss*Biomarkers/bloodPediatric Obesity/therapy/metabolism/bloodAdolescentObesity/metabolism/therapy/bloodMetabolomeMachine LearningWeight Reduction Programs","PMC11364699",NA,"NOTNLM","ChildrenInsulin resistanceMetabolitesObesity","The authors declare no competing interests.","2024/08/31 09:53","2024/09/01 21:12","2024/08/30","2024/08/30 11:15","2023/12/12 00:00 [received]2024/08/05 00:00 [accepted]2024/09/01 21:12 [medline]2024/08/31 09:53 [pubmed]2024/08/30 11:15 [entrez]2024/08/30 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1007/s00726-024-03409-2 [pii]3409 [pii]10.1007/s00726-024-03409-2 [doi]","epublish","Amino Acids. 2024 Aug 30;56(1):54. doi: 10.1007/s00726-024-03409-2.","© 2024.

METHODS: Eighty participants were included in the study. The four groups were formed by individuals with DM2 and periodontitis (DM2 + P, n = 20), DM2 without periodontitis (DM2, n = 20), periodontitis without DM2 (P, n = 20) and individuals without periodontitis and without DM2 (H, n = 20). Periodontal clinical examinations were performed and unstimulated saliva was collected. Proteomic analysis was performed by shotgun mass spectrometry. The results were obtained by searching the Homo sapiens database of the UniProt catalog. RESULTS: A total of 220 proteins were identified in saliva samples. In the comparison between DM2 + P and DM2 groups, 27 proteins were up-regulated [e.g. S100-A8 was 6 times up-regulated (humoral immune response pathway)]. The DM2 + P and P groups had 26 up-regulated proteins [e.g. Immunoglobulin lambda constant 7 more than 2 times up-regulated (complement activation pathway)]. The non-DM2 groups (P and H) presented 22 up-regulated proteins [e.g. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase more than 2 times up-regulated (Peptidyl-cysteine S-nitrosylation pathway)]. The groups without periodontitis (DM2 and H) showed 23 were up-regulated proteins [e.g. Hemoglobin subunit alpha that was more than 10 times up-regulated (cellular oxidant detoxification pathway)]. CONCLUSION: The presence of DM2 and periodontitis significantly impacts the salivary proteome. Our proteomic analysis demonstrated that changes in the S100 family proteins (S100A8 and S100 A9) are highly related to the presence of DM2 and periodontitis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and periodontitis are highly prevalent chronic diseases that present a wide variety of signs and symptoms. They present a bidirectional relationship, where patients with DM have a higher prevalence and severity of periodontitis, and patients with periodontitis have a higher prevalence of DM, worse glycemic control, and more diabetic complications. Diagnosing periodontitis requires specific clinical examinations, which require a highly trained operator. In this study, we used high throughput proteomics in order to evaluate non-invasive biomarkers for periodontitis in type 2 DM subjects. The results can contribute to earlier, more accurate, and less costly diagnosis of periodontitis in diabetic subjects, enabling better diabetes control.","Furukawa, Monique VieiraOliveira, Marissol Fernandesda Silva, Rodrigo AugustoMáximo, Priscila MacedoDionizio, AlineVentura, Talita Mendes OliveiraCortelli, Sheila CavalcaCorelli, José RobertoBuzalaf, Marília Afonso RabeloRovai, Emanuel Silva","Furukawa MVOliveira MFda Silva RAMáximo PMDionizio AVentura TMOCortelli SCCorelli JRBuzalaf MARRovai ES","Departament of Dentistry, Periodontics Research Division, University of Taubaté, São Paulo, Brazil.Departament of Dentistry, Periodontics Research Division, University of Taubaté, São Paulo, Brazil.Departament of Dentistry, Periodontics Research Division, University of Taubaté, São Paulo, Brazil.Department of Biological Sciences, University of São Paulo, Bauru School of Dentistry, Bauru, Brazil.Department of Biological Sciences, University of São Paulo, Bauru School of Dentistry, Bauru, Brazil.Department of Biological Sciences, University of São Paulo, Bauru School of Dentistry, Bauru, Brazil.Departament of Dentistry, Periodontics Research Division, University of Taubaté, São Paulo, Brazil.Departament of Dentistry, Periodontics Research Division, University of Taubaté, São Paulo, Brazil.Department of Biological Sciences, University of São Paulo, Bauru School of Dentistry, Bauru, Brazil.Institute of Science and Technology, Division of Periodontics, São Paulo State University (Unesp), Av.

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 32 patients with severe obesity (16 males and 16 females) of Central European descent who underwent bariatric surgery. Clinical parameters and body composition were assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioelectrical impedance, with 15 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 17 with hypertension. Paired SAT and VAT samples, along with serum samples, were subjected to state-of-the-art proteomics liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Our analysis identified 7,284 proteins across SAT and VAT, with 1,249 differentially expressed proteins between the tissues and 1,206 proteins identified in serum. Correlation analyses between differential protein expression and clinical traits suggest a significant role of SAT in the pathogenesis of obesity and related metabolic complications. Specifically, the SAT proteomic profile revealed marked alterations in metabolic pathways and processes contributing to tissue fibrosis and inflammation. Although we do not establish a definitive causal relationship, it appears that VAT might respond to SAT metabolic dysfunction by potentially enhancing mitochondrial activity and expanding its capacity. However, when this adaptive response is exceeded, it could possibly contribute to insulin resistance (IR) and in some cases, it may be associated with the progression to T2D. Our findings provide critical insights into the molecular foundations of SAT and VAT in obesity and may inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study provides insights into distinct proteomic profiles of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and serum in patients with severe obesity and their associations with clinical traits and body composition. It underscores SAT's crucial role in obesity development and related complications, such as insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our findings emphasize the importance of understanding the SAT and VAT balance in energy homeostasis, proteostasis, and the potential role of SAT capacity in the development of metabolic disorders.","Hruska, PavelKucera, JanKuruczova, DanielaBuzga, MarekPekar, MatejHoleczy, PavolPotesil, DavidZdrahal, ZbynekBienertova-Vasku, Julie","Hruska PAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-0705-854XKucera JKuruczova DBuzga MPekar MHoleczy PPotesil DZdrahal ZBienertova-Vasku J","Department of Pathological Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.RECETOX, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.Department of Physical Activities and Health Sciences, Faculty of Sports Studies, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.RECETOX, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.Department of Laboratory Medicine, University hospital Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic.Department of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic.Vascular and Miniinvasive Surgery Center, Hospital AGEL Trinec-Podlesi, Trinec, Czech Republic.Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.Department of Surgery, Vitkovice Hospital, Ostrava, Czech Republic.Department of Surgical Disciplines, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic.Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.Department of Pathological Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.RECETOX, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.Department of Physical Activities and Health Sciences, Faculty of Sports Studies, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20231004","United States","Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab","American journal of physiology.

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays an essential role in energy metabolism, thus it will give us promising treatment targets through elucidating underlying mechanisms of BAT in obesity. In this study, female C57BL/6J mice were fed HFD or normal diet (ND) for 22 weeks. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was performed to evaluate insulin sensitivity, which was independently correlated with obesity. Using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) coupled with 2D LC-MS/MS, we quantitated 3048 proteins in BAT. As compared HFD with ND, we obtained 727 differentially expressed proteins. Functional analysis found that those proteins were mainly assigned to the pathway of mitochondrial function. In this pathway, carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and apoptosis-inducing factor 1 (AIF1) were up-regulated significantly by HFD, and they were confirmed by western blotting. The results indicated that HFD might induce the apoptosis of brown adipocytes via the up-regulated AIF1. Meanwhile, HFD also stimulated fatty acid β-oxidation and raised compensatory energy consuming through the increases of CPT2 and UCP1, respectively. However, the apoptosis of brown adipocytes might weaken the compensatory energy expenditure, and finally contribute to overweight/obesity. So, preventing the apoptosis of brown adipocytes may be the key target to treat obesity.","Li, JuanZhao, Wei-GangShen, Zhu-FangYuan, TaoLiu, Shuai-NanLiu, QuanFu, YongSun, Wei","Li JZhao WGShen ZFYuan TLiu SNLiu QFu YSun W","Department of Endocrinology, Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of Ministry of Health, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.Department of Endocrinology, Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of Ministry of Health, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Diabetes Research Center of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.Department of Endocrinology, Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of Ministry of Health, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Diabetes Research Center of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Diabetes Research Center of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.Department of Endocrinology, Key Laboratory of Endocrinology of Ministry of Health, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.Core Facility of Instrument, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences/School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.","eng",NA,"Comparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20150306","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Proteome)","IM","Adipocytes, Brown/*metabolism/pathologyAdipose Tissue, Brown/*metabolism/pathologyAnimalsFemale*Gene Expression RegulationMass SpectrometryMiceObesity/*metabolism/pathologyProteome/*biosynthesisProteomics/methods","PMC4352050",NA,NA,NA,"Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2015/03/10 06:00","2016/01/15 06:00","2015/03/06","2015/03/10 06:00","2014/10/23 00:00 [received]2015/01/12 00:00 [accepted]2015/03/10 06:00 [entrez]2015/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]2016/01/15 06:00 [medline]2015/03/06 00:00 [pmc-release]","PONE-D-14-47202 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0119350 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2015 Mar 6;10(3):e0119350. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0119350. eCollection 2015.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0119350",NA,2015

We identified and compared metabolite signatures in obese children with type 2 diabetes (T2D), obese children without diabetes (OB), and healthy, age and gender-matched normal weight controls (NW) by measuring 273 analytes in fasting plasma and 24-hour urine samples from 90 subjects by targeted LC-MS/MS. Diabetic subjects were within 2 years of diagnosis in an attempt to capture early-stage disease prior to declining renal function. We found 22 urine metabolites that were uniquely associated with T2D when compared to OB and NW groups. The metabolites most significantly elevated in T2D youth included members of the betaine pathway, nucleic acid metabolism, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and their catabolites. Notably, the metabolite pattern in OB and T2D groups differed between urine and plasma, suggesting that urinary BCAAs and their intermediates behaved as a more specific biomarker for T2D, while plasma BCAAs associated with the obese, insulin resistant state independent of diabetes status. Correlative analysis of metabolites in the T2D signature indicated that betaine metabolites, BCAAs, and aromatic amino acids were associated with hyperglycemia, but BCAA acylglycine derivatives and nucleic acid metabolites were linked to insulin resistance. Of major interest, we found that urine levels of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICA-riboside) were increased in diabetic youth, identifying urine SAICA-riboside as a potential biomarker for T2D.","Concepcion, JenniferChen, KatherineSaito, RintaroGangoiti, JonMendez, EricNikita, Maria EleniBarshop, Bruce ANatarajan, LokiSharma, KumarKim, Jane J","Concepcion JChen KSaito RGangoiti JMendez ENikita MEBarshop BAAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9264-3270Natarajan LSharma KKim JJAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-0228-0128","Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, CA, United States of America.Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.Keio University, Yamagata, Japan.Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, CA, United States of America.Department of Family Medicine and Public Health, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.Center for Renal Precision Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, Unied States of America.Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, CA, United States of America.","eng","R01 DK110541/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesUL1 TR001442/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleObservational StudyResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20200626","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Amino Acids, Branched-Chain)0 (Biomarkers)0 (Nucleic Acids)0 (Purines)3SCV180C9W (Betaine)","IM","AdolescentAmino Acids, Branched-Chain/metabolismBetaine/metabolismBiomarkers/blood/metabolism/urineBiosynthetic PathwaysChromatography, High Pressure LiquidComputational BiologyCross-Sectional StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*metabolism/urineFemaleHumans*Insulin ResistanceMaleMetabolomics/methodsNucleic Acids/metabolismObesity/blood/*metabolism/urinePurines/*biosynthesisTandem Mass SpectrometryYoung Adult","PMC7319336",NA,NA,NA,"The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2020/06/27 06:00","2020/09/10 06:00","2020/06/26","2020/06/27 06:00","2019/08/26 00:00 [received]2020/06/05 00:00 [accepted]2020/06/27 06:00 [entrez]2020/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]2020/09/10 06:00 [medline]2020/06/26 00:00 [pmc-release]","PONE-D-19-24078 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0234970 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2020 Jun 26;15(6):e0234970. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0234970. eCollection 2020.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0234970",NA,2020

The aim of this study was to investigate the independent association between mannose and a first MI in a group of subjects characterized according to their glycaemic state. METHODS: Fasting plasma mannose concentrations were analysed in 777 patients 6-10 weeks after a first myocardial infarction and in 770 matched controls by means of high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Participants without known diabetes mellitus were categorized by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n = 1045), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n = 246) or newly detected type 2 diabetes (T2DM, n = 112). The association between mannose and MI was investigated across these glycaemic states by logistic regression. RESULTS: Mannose levels increased across the glycaemic states (p < 0.0001) and were significantly associated with a first MI in the whole study population (odds ratio, OR: 2.2; 95% CI 1.4 to - 3.5). Considering the different subgroups separately, the association persisted only in subjects with NGT (adjusted OR: 2.0; 95% CI 1.2-3.6), but not in subgroups with glucose perturbations (adjusted OR: 1.8, 95% CI 0.8-3.7). CONCLUSIONS: Mannose concentrations increased across worsening levels of glucose perturbations but were independently associated with a first MI only in NGT individuals. Thus, mannose might be a novel, independent risk marker for MI, possibly targeted for the early management of previously unidentified patients at high cardiovascular risk.","Fortin, ElenaFerrannini, GiuliaCampi, BeatriceMellbin, LindaNorhammar, AnnaNäsman, PerSaba, AlessandroFerrannini, EleRydén, Lars","Fortin EFerrannini GCampi BMellbin LNorhammar ANäsman PSaba AFerrannini ERydén L","Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine K2, Karolinska Institutet, Norrbacka S1:02, 171 76, Stockholm, Sweden. elena.fortin@ki.se.Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine K2, Karolinska Institutet, Norrbacka S1:02, 171 76, Stockholm, Sweden.National Research Council Institute of Clinical Physiology, Pisa, Italy.Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine K2, Karolinska Institutet, Norrbacka S1:02, 171 76, Stockholm, Sweden.Heart Vascular and Neuro Theme, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine K2, Karolinska Institutet, Norrbacka S1:02, 171 76, Stockholm, Sweden.Capio St Görans Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.Center for Safety Research, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Department of Pathology, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.Clinical Pathology Laboratory, Santa Chiara University Hospital, Pisa, Italy.National Research Council Institute of Clinical Physiology, Pisa, Italy.Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine K2, Karolinska Institutet, Norrbacka S1:02, 171 76, Stockholm, Sweden.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20220923","England","Cardiovasc Diabetol","Cardiovascular diabetology","101147637","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Glucose)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)PHA4727WTP (Mannose)","IM","BiomarkersBlood Glucose/analysisCase-Control Studies*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2Glucose*Glucose IntoleranceHumans*Insulin ResistanceMannose*Myocardial Infarction/complications/diagnosis","PMC9508730",NA,"NOTNLM","Glucose perturbationsMannoseMyocardial infarctionRisk marker","G.F. has received grant support from the Erling-Persson family foundation and reports personal fees from the Swedish Heart and Lung foundation, European Society of Cardiology, Boheringer Ingelheim and Astra Zeneca, but has no conflicts of interest related to this work. LM reports personal fees from Novo Nordisk, Sanofi Aventis, Astra Zeneca, MSD, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis and Amgen outside the present work.

METHODS: The exosome proteome content from 24 hour urine samples of pregnant subjects with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM, N=8) and pre-gestational Type 2 diabetes (PGD, N = 10) were compared with control samples (CTRL, N = 10) obtained at week 20 of pregnancy. Differences in exosome protein load between groups was identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, analyzed by linear regression in negative binomial distribution, visualized in MetaboAnalyst (version 3.0), and validated by western immunoblotting. RESULTS: At the 20(th) week of pregnancy, we identified 646, 734 and 856 proteins in exosomes from 24 hour urine samples of patients from the CTRL, GDM and PGD groups, respectively. S100 calcium binding protein A9, damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signal, was found to be significantly increased in both GDM and PGD subjects. In GDM subjects the peptide counts for S100A9 protein independently correlated with maternal obesity and macrosomia of the newborn infants. Early to late pregnancy developmental changes in the GDM group were shown to utilize pathways and protein expression levels differently from those in PGD or CTRL groups. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary exosome proteomic analysis non-invasively provides insights into maternal changes during diabetic pregnancy. Exosome biomarkers early in pregnancy can be potentially used to better understand pathophysiologic mechanisms of diabetes at a cellular level, and to distinguish between gestational and pre-gestational diabetes at the pathway level. This information can aid intervention efforts to improve pregnancy outcomes in women with diabetes.","Ramachandrarao, Satish PHamlin, Alyssa AAwdishu, LindaOvercash, RachaelZhou, MarcelaProudfoot, JamesIshaya, MichelleAghania, EamonMadrigal, AssaelKokoy-Mondragon, ChanthelKao, KellyKhoshaba, RoniBounkhoun, AnousoneGhassemian, MajidTarsa, MaryamNaviaux, Robert K","Ramachandrarao SPHamlin AAAwdishu LOvercash RZhou MProudfoot JIshaya MAghania EMadrigal AKokoy-Mondragon CKao KKhoshaba RBounkhoun AGhassemian MTarsa MNaviaux RK","Department of Medicine, Biomarkers Laboratory, O'Brien Center for Acute Kidney Injury Research, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Pediatrics, Center for Promotion of Maternal Health and Infant Development, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Medicine, Biomarkers Laboratory, O'Brien Center for Acute Kidney Injury Research, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Reproductive Medicine, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Medicine, Biomarkers Laboratory, O'Brien Center for Acute Kidney Injury Research, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Reproductive Medicine, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Medicine, Biomarkers Laboratory, O'Brien Center for Acute Kidney Injury Research, UC San Diego, USA.Clinical and Translational Research Institute, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Medicine, Biomarkers Laboratory, O'Brien Center for Acute Kidney Injury Research, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Medicine, Biomarkers Laboratory, O'Brien Center for Acute Kidney Injury Research, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Medicine, Biomarkers Laboratory, O'Brien Center for Acute Kidney Injury Research, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Medicine, Biomarkers Laboratory, O'Brien Center for Acute Kidney Injury Research, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Pediatrics, Center for Promotion of Maternal Health and Infant Development, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Medicine, Biomarkers Laboratory, O'Brien Center for Acute Kidney Injury Research, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Medicine, Biomarkers Laboratory, O'Brien Center for Acute Kidney Injury Research, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, Biomolecular & Proteomics Spectrometry Facility, UC San Diego, USA.Department of Reproductive Medicine, UC San Diego, USA.Departments of Medicine, Pathology and Pediatrics, UC San Diego, USA.","eng","P30 DK079337/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesP60 MD000220/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States","Journal Article","20160201","United States","Madridge J Diabetes","Madridge journal of diabetes","101750547",NA,NA,NA,"PMC6707737","NIHMS1028115","NOTNLM","Damage associated molecular patternDiabetic pregnancyExosomeGestational diabetesProteomicsS100A9Urine exosomes","Conflicts of Interest: The author(s) report(s) no conflict of interest.","2016/01/01 00:00","2016/01/01 00:01","2019/08/23","2019/08/27 06:00","2019/08/27 06:00 [entrez]2016/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]2016/01/01 00:01 [medline]2019/08/23 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.18689/mjd-1000103 [doi]","ppublish","Madridge J Diabetes. 2016;1(1):11-22. doi: 10.18689/mjd-1000103.

It often leads to undiagnosed complications and commonly coexists with other health conditions. This study investigates two types of prevalent comorbidities related to T2DM-the circulatory system (DCM1) and digestive system diseases (DCM2)-using clinical, genomic and proteomic datasets. The aim is to identify new biomarkers by applying existing machine learning (ML) based techniques for early detection, prognosis and diagnosis of these comorbidities. METHODS: Here, we report a cross-sectional retrospective analysis from a T2DM dataset of T2DM associated concordant comorbidities (diseases with shared pathophysiology and management) from the Diastrat cohort (a T2DM cohort) recruited at the Northern Ireland Centre for Stratified Medicine (NICSM), in Northern Ireland. RESULTS: In the clinical data analysis, we identified that lipidemia was shown to negatively correlate with depression in the DCM1 group while positively correlate with depression in the DCM2 group. In genomic analysis, we identified statistically significant variants rs9844730 in procollagen-lysine (PLOD2), rs73590361 in beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase (B4GALNT3) and rs964680 in A kinase (PRKA) anchor protein 14 (AKAP14) which appear to differentiate DCM1 and DCM2 groups. In proteomic analysis, we identified 4 statistically significant proteins: natriuretic peptides B (BNP), pro-adrenomedullin (ADM), natriuretic peptides B (NT-proBNP) and discoidin (DCBLD2) that can differentiate DCM1 and DCM2 groups and have built robust ML model using clinical, genomic, and proteomic markers (0.83 receiver operative characteristics curve area, 84% positive predictive value and 83% negative predictive value and a classification accuracy of 83%) for prediction of DCM1 and DCM2 groups. CONCLUSION: Our study successfully identifies novel clinical, genomic, and proteomic biomarkers that differentiate between circulatory and digestive system comorbidities in Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus patients. The machine learning model we developed demonstrates strong predictive capabilities, providing a promising tool for the early detection, prognosis, and diagnosis of these T2DM-associated comorbidities. These findings have the potential to enhance personalized management strategies for patients with T2DM, ultimately improving clinical outcomes. Further research is needed to validate these biomarkers and integrate them into clinical practice.","Villikudathil, Angelina ThomasMc Guigan, Declan HEnglish, Andrew","Villikudathil ATAUID ORCID: 0009-0003-6057-5359Mc Guigan DHAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8717-6962English AAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-1232-5585","Centre for Stratified Medicine, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences, Ulster University, Magee Campus, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, UK. athmspsalms23@gmail.com.Centre for Stratified Medicine, Faculty of Life and Health Sciences, Ulster University, Magee Campus, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, UK.School of Health and Life Sciences, Teesside university, England, UK.","eng","Vice Chancellors Research Scholarship/Ulster University Magee Campus/","Journal Article","20241107","Germany","Acta Diabetol","Acta diabetologica","9200299",NA,"IM",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","Biomarker DiscoveryBorutaClinical Data AnalysisConcordant comorbiditiesGenomicsMachine learningProteomicsSingle nucleotide polymorphismsType-2 diabetes",NA,"2024/11/13 13:56","2024/11/13 13:56",NA,"2024/11/07 11:03","2024/07/11 00:00 [received]2024/09/28 00:00 [accepted]2024/11/13 13:56 [medline]2024/11/13 13:56 [pubmed]2024/11/07 11:03 [entrez]","10.1007/s00592-024-02383-1 [pii]10.1007/s00592-024-02383-1 [doi]","aheadofprint","Acta Diabetol. 2024 Nov 7. doi: 10.1007/s00592-024-02383-1.","© 2024.

We examined the effects of GDM on the proteome, redox status, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant gene expression in human fetal endothelial cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that proteins involved in redox homeostasis were significantly altered in GDM and associated with increased mitochondrial superoxide generation, protein oxidation, DNA damage, and diminished glutathione (GSH) synthesis. In GDM cells, the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) failed to induce nuclear Nrf2 accumulation and mRNA and/or protein expression of Nrf2 and its target genes NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), Bach1, cystine/glutamate transporter, and glutamate cysteine ligase. Although methylation of CpG islands in Nrf2 or NQO1 promoters was unaltered by GDM, decreased DJ-1 and increased phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3β levels may account for impaired Nrf2 signaling. HNE-induced increases in GSH and NQO1 levels were abrogated by Nrf2 small interfering RNA in normal cells, and overexpression of Nrf2 in GDM cells partially restored NQO1 induction. Dysregulation of Nrf2 in fetal endothelium may contribute to the increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in offspring.","Cheng, XinghuaChapple, Sarah JPatel, BijalPuszyk, WilliamSugden, DavidYin, XiaokeMayr, ManuelSiow, Richard C MMann, Giovanni E","Cheng XChapple SJPatel BPuszyk WSugden DYin XMayr MSiow RCMann GE","Cardiovascular Division, British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, King's College London, London, U.K.","eng","FS/13/2/29892/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United KingdomPG/13/1/29801/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United KingdomFS/10/59/28533/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom","Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20130823","United States","Diabetes","Diabetes","0372763","0 (Antioxidants)0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)","IM","AdultAntioxidants/*metabolismDiabetes, Gestational/*metabolismFemaleGlutathione/metabolismHuman Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/*metabolismHumansNF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolismOxidation-ReductionPregnancyReactive Oxygen Species/metabolismSignal Transduction/*physiologyUp-Regulation","PMC3837032",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013/08/27 06:00","2014/01/18 06:00","2014/12/01","2013/08/27 06:00","2013/08/27 06:00 [entrez]2013/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]2014/01/18 06:00 [medline]2014/12/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","db13-0169 [pii]0169 [pii]10.2337/db13-0169 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes. 2013 Dec;62(12):4088-97. doi: 10.2337/db13-0169.

Biomarkers potentially modifiable with lifestyle changes deserve a special interest. Our aims were to analyze: (a) The associations of lysine, 2-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA) or pipecolic acid with the risk of T2D or CVD in the PREDIMED trial; (b) the effect of the dietary intervention on 1-year changes in these metabolites, and (c) whether the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) interventions can modify the effects of these metabolites on CVD or T2D risk. METHODS: Two unstratified case-cohort studies nested within the PREDIMED trial were used. For CVD analyses, we selected 696 non-cases and 221 incident CVD cases; for T2D, we included 610 non-cases and 243 type 2 diabetes incident cases. Metabolites were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, at baseline and after 1-year of intervention. RESULTS: In weighted Cox regression models, we found that baseline lysine (HR(+1 SD increase) = 1.26; 95% CI 1.06-1.51) and 2-AAA (HR(+1 SD increase) = 1.28; 95% CI 1.05-1.55) were both associated with a higher risk of T2D, but not with CVD. A significant interaction (p = 0.032) between baseline lysine and T2D on the risk of CVD was observed: subjects with prevalent T2D and high levels of lysine exhibited the highest risk of CVD. The intervention with MedDiet did not have a significant effect on 1-year changes of the metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide an independent prospective replication of the association of 2-AAA with future risk of T2D. We show an association of lysine with subsequent CVD risk, which is apparently diabetes-dependent. No evidence of effects of MedDiet intervention on lysine, 2-AAA or pipecolic acid changes was found.

Accumulating evidence suggests that an etiologic role for serum microbiota and circulating metabolites in the pathogenesis of T2DM. This study aims to characterize the serum microbiota and circulating metabolites in cynomolgus monkeys with spontaneous T2DM, and provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical T2DM. METHODS: We collected serum samples of the 14 cynomolgus monkeys (15-20 years old, male) for serum microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region amplicon sequencing and circulating metabolites analysis by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, of which seven were spontaneous T2DM cynomolgus monkeys and seven were healthy controls. RESULTS: Our results showed that the serum microbiota abundance and diversity were significantly increased in cynomolgus monkeys with spontaneous T2DM compared to healthy controls, the phyla of Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi and the genera of Lactobacillus, rhodobacter and collinsella were also significantly increased. A total of 114 serum differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were identified, of which 22 were selected as potential biomarkers candidates related to spontaneous T2DM in cynomolgus monkeys by multivariate data analysis. In addition, serum levels of total SCFAs, acetate, butyrate, caproate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate were also significantly increased in the present study. The correlation network analyses have selected certain key DEMs, such as D-Psicose, 4-Oxoproline, D-Glutamine, and Hydroxyphenyllactic acid, which may serve as potential biomarkers for distinguishing between T2DM and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Our results provide preliminary insights on perturbed serum microbiota and circulating metabolites of cynomolgus monkeys with spontaneous T2DM. These findings would be useful to develop microbiota-based strategies for T2DM prevention and control.","Tian, ChaoyangYang, QunhuiLv, HaizhouYue, Feng","Tian CAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7985-1793Yang QLv HYue FAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3246-8209","Sanya Research Institute of Hainan University, School of Biomedical Engineering, Hainan University, Sanya, China.Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Hainan Province, One Health Institute, Hainan University, Haikou, China.Hainan Jingang Biotech Co., Ltd, Haikou, China.Hainan Jingang Biotech Co., Ltd, Haikou, China.Sanya Research Institute of Hainan University, School of Biomedical Engineering, Hainan University, Sanya, China.Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Hainan Province, One Health Institute, Hainan University, Haikou, China.","eng","Hainan Natural Science Foundation High-level Talents Project/Hainan Key Research and Development Project/the PhD Scientific Research and Innovation Foundation of Sanya Yazhou Bay Science and Technology City/","Journal Article",NA,"Denmark","J Med Primatol","Journal of medical primatology","0320626","0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Animals*Macaca fascicularis/blood*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/veterinary/microbiologyMale*MicrobiotaRNA, Ribosomal, 16SBiomarkers/bloodBacteria/classification",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","biomarkerscynomolgus monkeysmetabolomemicrobiomeserumtype 2 diabetes mellitus",NA,"2024/09/23 07:30","2024/09/23 07:31",NA,"2024/09/23 00:22","2024/08/22 00:00 [revised]2024/07/18 00:00 [received]2024/09/04 00:00 [accepted]2024/09/23 07:31 [medline]2024/09/23 07:30 [pubmed]2024/09/23 00:22 [entrez]","10.1111/jmp.12738 [doi]","ppublish","J Med Primatol. 2024 Oct;53(5):e12738. doi: 10.1111/jmp.12738.","© 2024 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Other than for cardiovascular complications, diabetes is particularly challenging for the kidney's health and proper function. Prolonged exposure of the kidneys to hyperglycemia in fact often results in a clinical complication called diabetic glomerulosclerosis, also known as diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy represents today the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in Western countries. When left untreated or undiagnosed, diabetic nephropathy is ultimately responsible for the need for dialysis and, in the worst cases, kidney transplantation of the affected individuals. The pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy has been studied extensively. A great number of metabolites, cytokines, proteins and transcription factors play a role in the accumulation of extracellular matrix and mesangial proliferation in the glomerulus; importantly, these phenotypic alterations are considered the 2 histological hallmarks of diabetic nephropathy. Additional effort is however required to understand the wide network of biochemical pathways that link diabetes to the renal damage in the long run. The integrative analysis of the proteomic and transcriptomic features of body fluids and/or bioptic samples among different categories of patients affected by diabetic nephropathy, if based on the accurate classification of the histopathological changes in the glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartment, could lead to the identification of new early biomarkers. This approach could represent an effective, noninvasive, alternative tool for early diagnosis and intervention.","Conserva, FrancescaPontrelli, PaolaAccetturo, MatteoGesualdo, Loreto","Conserva FPontrelli PAccetturo MGesualdo L","Renal, Dialysis and Transplantation Unit, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari  Italy.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleReview","20130327","Italy","J Nephrol","Journal of nephrology","9012268","0 (Genetic Markers)0 (MicroRNAs)","IM","AnimalsDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complicationsDiabetic Nephropathies/*etiology/genetics/metabolism/pathology/therapyDisease Progression*Gene Expression Profiling/methodsGenetic MarkersHumansKidney/*metabolism/pathologyMicroRNAs/*metabolismPredictive Value of TestsPrognosis*Proteomics/methods*Signal TransductionTranscriptome",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013/04/02 06:00","2015/06/05 06:00",NA,"2013/04/02 06:00","2013/01/29 00:00 [accepted]2013/04/02 06:00 [entrez]2013/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]","F78E2B95-31B2-49EB-AEFA-038B3DF03BB0 [pii]10.5301/jn.5000262 [doi]","ppublish","J Nephrol. 2013 Sep-Oct;26(5):811-20. doi: 10.5301/jn.5000262.

The current markers of diabetic nephropathy are based on albuminuria and clinical signs of retinopathy. Sensitive and specific noninvasive diagnostic tools, unbiased by the presence of comorbidities, are needed, especially to detect the early stages of diabetic complications. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze changes in urinary protein excretion based on the stage of DKD using quantitative proteomics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 27 healthy controls were age and sex-matched to 72 diabetes patients classified into 3 groups: no signs of retinopathy or nephropathy (n = 33), retinopathy but no microalbuminuria (n = 15), and diabetic nephropathy (DN) based on overt albuminuria or microalbuminuria with retinopathy (n = 24). To assess the intergroup differences, samples were partially pooled, tagged using 8-plex iTRAQ reagents, and the resulting peptide mixture was resolved by isoelectrofocusing. The obtained fractions were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Data were analyzed using the MASCOT software and dedicated in-house proteomic data analysis programs. RESULTS: The changes in the urine proteome following DKD progression involved some known protein markers of DN and several other proteins. Decreased levels of some proteins are presumably related to impaired secretory function of other organs affected by diabetes. In particular, a diminished excretion of pancreatic amylase and deoxyribonuclease I suggested exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), coexisting with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in the urinary excretion of some pancreatic enzymes suggests EPI associated with diabetes. This hypothesis is yet to be verified; nevertheless, renal and extrarenal confounders must be considered when interpreting the results of quantitative urinary proteomics.  ","Lewandowicz, AndrzejBakun, MagdalenaKohutnicki, RafałFabijańska, AgnieszkaKistowski, MichałImiela, JacekDadlez, Michał","Lewandowicz ABakun MKohutnicki RFabijańska AKistowski MImiela JDadlez M",NA,"eng",NA,"Comparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20150112","Poland","Pol Arch Med Wewn","Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej","0401225","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Proteome)","IM","AdultAgedAlbuminuria/physiopathology/urineBiomarkers/*urineDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications/urineDiabetic Nephropathies/*etiology/physiopathology/*urineDiabetic Retinopathy/physiopathology/*urineDisease ProgressionFemaleHumansKidney Failure, Chronic/*etiology/physiopathology/*urineMaleMiddle AgedProteomeProteomicsTandem Mass Spectrometry",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015/01/13 06:00","2016/12/15 06:00",NA,"2015/01/13 06:00","2015/01/13 06:00 [entrez]2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]","AOP_15_004 [pii]10.20452/pamw.2640 [doi]","ppublish","Pol Arch Med Wewn. 2015;125(1-2):27-38. doi: 10.20452/pamw.2640.

In brief, the hyperglycemia condition in diabetes mellitus has an impact on protein glycation of all joint components, including molecule, such as perlecan. The protein expression of perlecan reflects the presence amount of perlecan in the matrix of articular cartilage. However, the impact of hyperglycemia on articular perlecan has not been explained. Moreover, the role of perlecan as a mechanotransducer for chondrocytes in type 1 Diabetes mellitus remains unclear. AIM: This research aims to analyze the effect of hyperglycemia in type 1 Diabetes mellitus to the mRNA level and protein expression of perlecan. METHODS: Thirty-five adult male rats were divided into seven groups, such as three groups of rat model with anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) at right knee (ACLT1, ACLT2, ACLT3); three groups of rats with ACLT at right knee which followed by Streptozotocin injection for diabetic mice model (DM1, DM2, DM3); and control group (N). Rat sacrificed at the third week, fourth week, and sixth week after two months of maintenance. The mRNA level and protein expression were analyzed by using PCR and Western blot. All of data was analyzed by ANOVA. RESULTS: Protein expression of perlecan in ACLT mice with diabetes mellitus (DM1, DM2, DM3 group) was gradually decreased according to the increased hyperglycemia duration. Whilst, protein expression of perlecan within ACLT mice without diabetes mellitus (ACLT1, ACLT2, ACLT3 group) was increased. The similar result also demonstrated by the mRNA level of perlecan. Group of DM1, DM2, DM3 exhibited decreased mRNA level of perlecan over the hyperglycemia duration. While, ACLT1, ACLT2, and ACLT3 group had a gradually increased of perlecan mRNA level. CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia on osteoarthritic condition decreased mRNA level and protein expression of perlecan which increased the severity of osteoarthritis disease.","Njoto, IbrahimKalim, HandonoSoeatmadji, Djoko WHandono, KusworiniFatchiyah, Fatchiyah","Njoto IKalim HSoeatmadji DWHandono KFatchiyah F","Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Wijaya Kusuma University, Surabaya, Indonesia.Faculty of Medicine, University of Brawijaya, Malang, Indonesia.Research Centre of Smart Molecule of Natural Genetics Resources, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Brawijaya University, Malang, East Java, Indonesia.Research Centre of Smart Molecule of Natural Genetics Resources, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Brawijaya University, Malang, East Java, Indonesia.Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Wijaya Kusuma University, Surabaya, Indonesia.Faculty of Medicine, University of Brawijaya, Malang, Indonesia.Research Centre of Smart Molecule of Natural Genetics Resources, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Brawijaya University, Malang, East Java, Indonesia.Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Wijaya Kusuma University, Surabaya, Indonesia.Faculty of Medicine, University of Brawijaya, Malang, Indonesia.Research Centre of Smart Molecule of Natural Genetics Resources, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Brawijaya University, Malang, East Java, Indonesia.","eng",NA,"Journal Article",NA,"Bosnia and Herzegovina","Med Arch","Medical archives (Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina)","101635337","0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans)0 (RNA, Messenger)143972-95-6 (perlecan)","IM","AnimalsBlood GlucoseDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*blood/complicationsDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*blood/complicationsDisease Models, AnimalHeparan Sulfate Proteoglycans/*genetics/*metabolismHyperglycemia/*blood/etiologyMaleOsteoarthritis/complications/genetics/*metabolismRNA, Messenger/metabolismRats","PMC6643336",NA,"NOTNLM","Diabetes mellitushyperglycemiaosteoarthriticperlecanproteomic",NA,"2019/08/14 06:00","2020/01/29 06:00","2019/06/01","2019/08/13 06:00","2019/08/13 06:00 [entrez]2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]2020/01/29 06:00 [medline]2019/06/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.5455/medarh.2019.73.144-148 [doi]","ppublish","Med Arch. 2019 Jun;73(3):144-148. doi: 10.5455/medarh.2019.73.144-148.",NA,NA,NA,"10.5455/medarh.2019.73.144-148",NA,2019

In this context, our study presents a proteomic analysis of post-exercise skeletal muscle biopsies from individuals across a spectrum of glucose metabolism states: normal, prediabetes, and T2D. This enabled the identification of significant protein relationships indicative of each specific glycemic condition. Our investigation primarily leveraged the machine learning approach, employing the white-box algorithm relative evolutionary hierarchical analysis (REHA), to explore the impact of regulated, mixed mode exercise on skeletal muscle proteome in subjects with diverse glycemic status. This method aimed to advance the diagnosis of IR and T2D and elucidate the molecular pathways involved in its development and the response to exercise. Additionally, we used proteomics-specific statistical analysis to provide a comparative perspective, highlighting the nuanced differences identified by REHA. Validation of the REHA model with a comparable external dataset further demonstrated its efficacy in distinguishing between diverse proteomic profiles. Key metrics such as accuracy and the area under the ROC curve confirmed REHA's capability to uncover novel molecular pathways and significant protein interactions, offering fresh insights into the effects of exercise on IR and T2D pathophysiology of skeletal muscle. The visualizations not only underscored significant proteins and their interactions but also showcased decision trees that effectively differentiate between various glycemic states, thereby enhancing our understanding of the biomolecular landscape of T2D.","Czajkowska, AnnaCzajkowski, MarcinSzczerbinski, LukaszJurczuk, KrzysztofReska, DanielKwedlo, WojciechKretowski, MarekZabielski, PiotrKretowski, Adam","Czajkowska ACzajkowski MSzczerbinski LJurczuk KReska DKwedlo WKretowski MZabielski PKretowski A","Clinical Research Centre, Medical University of Bialystok, Białystok, Poland. anna.czajkowska@umb.edu.pl.Department of Medical Biology, Medical University of Bialystok, A.

The present study evaluated the antioxidant properties of semaglutide using a DACD model of inflammation. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, omics technologies were employed. Comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the cells was conducted to identify the pathways responsible for the observed antioxidant effects. Semaglutide demonstrated the potential to enhance learning and memory functions while mitigating hippocampal pathological damage. RNA‑sequencing and data‑independent acquisition proteomics analyses identified 13,511 differentially expressed genes and 588 differentially expressed proteins between the control and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) groups. In addition, 1,378 genes and 2,394 proteins exhibited a differential expression between the T2DM and semaglutide (10 µg/kg) treatment groups. A combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis unveiled 40 common pathways. Acyl‑CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) was observed to be activated during oxidative stress and subsequently suppressed by semaglutide. Of note, the antioxidant and anti‑apoptotic properties of semaglutide in high glucose (HG) conditions were partially reversed upon ACOX1 overexpression. Overall, the present data provided molecular evidence to elucidate the physiological connections between semaglutide and neuronal function, and contribute to clarifying the role of semaglutide in combating oxidative stress and HG‑induced cognitive impairment.","Yang, YingSong, LuluYu, LipingZhang, JinpingZhang, Bo","Yang YSong LYu LZhang JZhang B","Department of Endocrinology, China‑Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing 100029, P.R.

Therefore, in this study, we examined the effect on proteomic cardiovascular risk protein markers of (i) mild iatrogenic hypoglycemia and (ii) severe iatrogenic hypoglycemia followed by rebound hyperglycemia. Methods: Two iatrogenic hypoglycemia studies were compared; firstly, mild hypoglycemia in 18 subjects (10 type 2 diabetes (T2D), 8 controls; blood glucose to 2.8 mmoL/L (50 mg/dL) for 1 h), and secondly, severe hypoglycemia in 46 subjects (23 T2D, 23 controls; blood glucose to <2.2 mmoL/L (<40 mg/dL) transiently followed by intravenous glucose reversal giving rebound hyperglycemia). A SOMAscan assay was used to measure 54 of the 92 cardiovascular protein biomarkers that reflect biomarkers involved in inflammation, cellular metabolic processes, cell adhesion, and immune response and complement activation. Results: Baseline to euglycemia showed no change in any of the proteins measured in the T2D cohort. With severe hypoglycemia, the study controls showed an increase in Angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1) (p < 0.01) and Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) (p < 0.01), but no changes were seen with mild hypoglycemia. In both the mild and severe hypoglycemia studies, at the point of hypoglycemia, T2D subjects showed suppression of Brother of CDO (BOC) (p < 0.01). At 1 h post-hypoglycemia, the changes in ANGPT1, DKK1, and BOC had resolved, with no additional protein biomarker changes despite rebound hyperglycemia from 1.8 ± 0.1 to 12.2 ± 2.0 mmol/L. Conclusions: Proteomic biomarkers of cardiovascular disease showed changes at hypoglycemia that resolved within 1 h following the hypoglycemic event and with no changes following hyperglycemia rebound, suggesting that any cardiovascular risk increase is due to the hypoglycemia and not due to glucose fluctuation per se.","Nandakumar, ManjulaSathyapalan, ThozhukatAtkin, Stephen LButler, Alexandra E","Nandakumar MSathyapalan TAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3544-2231Atkin SLAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5887-7257Butler AEAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5762-3917","Research Department, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Adliya P.O.

We established an analytical workflow that facilitates a reproducible depletion of high-abundance proteins, has high throughput applicability, and allows absolute quantification of proteins from mouse plasma samples by LC-SRM-MS. The ProteoMiner equalizing technology was adjusted to the small sample amount, and reproducibility of the identifications was monitored by spike proteins. Based on the label-free relative quantification of proteins in depleted plasma of a test set of NZO mice, assays for potential candidates were designed for the setup of a targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM) approach and absolute quantification. We could demonstrate that apolipoprotein E (Apoe), mannose-binding lectin 2 (Mbl2), and parotid secretory protein (Psp) are present at significantly different quantities in depleted plasma of diabetic NZO mice compared to non-diabetic controls using AQUA peptides. Quantification was validated for Mbl2 using the ELISA technology on non-depleted plasma.

This is due, in part, to the fact that current methods for assessing β-cell function are inaccurate, prone to error, labor-intensive, or affected by glucose-lowering therapy. The aim of the current study was to identify novel circulating biomarkers to monitor β-cell function and to identify individuals at high risk of developing β-cell dysfunction. In a nested case-control study from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) cohort (n = 1157), proteomics and miRNA profiling were performed on fasting plasma samples from 43 individuals who progressed to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 43 controls who maintained normal glucose tolerance (NGT) over three years. Groups were matched at baseline for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), insulin sensitivity (euglycemic clamp) and β-cell glucose sensitivity (mathematical modeling). Proteomic profiling was performed using the SomaLogic platform (Colorado, USA); miRNA expression was performed using a modified RT-PCR protocol (Regulus Therapeutics, California, USA). Results showed differentially expressed proteins and miRNAs including some with known links to type 2 diabetes, such as adiponectin, but also novel biomarkers and pathways. In cross sectional analysis at year 3, the top differentially expressed biomarkers in people with IGT/ reduced β-cell glucose sensitivity were adiponectin, alpha1-antitrypsin (known to regulate adiponectin levels), endocan, miR-181a, miR-342, and miR-323. At baseline, adiponectin, cathepsin D and NCAM.L1 (proteins expressed by pancreatic β-cells) were significantly lower in those that progressed to IGT. Many of the novel prognostic biomarker candidates were within the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway: for example, Noggin, DLL4 and miR-181a. Further validation studies are required in additional clinical cohorts and in patients with type 2 diabetes, but these results identify novel pathways and biomarkers that may have utility in monitoring β-cell function and/ or predicting future decline, allowing more targeted efforts to prevent and intercept type 2 diabetes.","Belongie, Kirstine JFerrannini, EleJohnson, KjellAndrade-Gordon, PatriciaHansen, Michael KPetrie, John R","Belongie KJFerrannini EJohnson KAndrade-Gordon PHansen MKPetrie JRAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4894-9819","Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Research, Janssen Research & Development, Spring House, Pennsylvania, United States of America.CNR Institute of Clinical Physiology, Pisa, Italy.Arbor Analytics, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States of America.Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Research, Janssen Research & Development, Spring House, Pennsylvania, United States of America.Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Research, Janssen Research & Development, Spring House, Pennsylvania, United States of America.Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20170828","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Insulin)","IM","AdultBiomarkers/bloodBlood Glucose/*metabolismCase-Control StudiesCross-Sectional StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*diagnosisEarly DiagnosisFemaleGlucose Clamp TechniqueGlucose Intolerance/*bloodGlucose Tolerance TestHumansInsulin/bloodInsulin Resistance/*physiologyInsulin-Secreting Cells/*metabolismMaleMiddle AgedRisk Factors","PMC5573304",NA,NA,NA,"Competing Interests: Dr. Petrie reports personal fees via his employer the University of Glasgow from Novo Nordisk; grants, personal fees and non-financial support from Sanofi Aventis via his employer; non-financial support from Merck (Germany); personal fees from Lilly, non-financial support from Itamar Medical, grants from JDRF (US Charity), grants and personal fees from Quintiles, personal fees from Janssen, personal fees from Boehringer Ingelheim.

It remains unknown if PostC can still protect heart in Type 2 diabetes, a rapidly growing disease in the world. This study investigated the efficacy of PostC in the leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice, which possess Type 2 diabetic characteristics including obesity, hyperglycaemia and hyperleptinaemia. Adult male C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) and db/db mice were anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated and subjected to left coronary artery occlusion for 30 min. followed by 24 hrs of reperfusion. For the PostC groups, the hearts underwent six cycles of 10 sec. of reperfusion and 10 sec. of re-occlusion at the onset of reperfusion. The mice were sacrificed at the end of 24 hrs reperfusion for infarct size measurement. PostC significantly reduced infarct size in WT mice (n = 6/group; P < 0.05), but not in the db/db mice. To identify alterations in protein expression by PostC, proteomic analyses were performed in the heart samples using two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis with three CyDye labelling, followed by mass spectrometry. The results show that mitochondrial proteins (F(1)-ATPase γ and Echs1) were down-regulated by PostC in WT heart. Such change was absent in the db/db heart. On the other hand, PostC reduced Hsp20 in the diabetic heart. In summary, PostC fails to protect Type 2 diabetic mice against ischaemia-reperfusion injury. The potential protein targets for the loss of PostC may include F(1)-ATPase γ, Echs1 and Hsp20 that could regulate cellular ATP consumption/production and defense response to ischaemic stress.","Zhu, Shu-GuangXi, LeiKukreja, Rakesh C","Zhu SGXi LKukreja RC","Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, VCU Pauley Heart Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298-0204, USA.","eng","R37 HL051045/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL093685-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL093685/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL079424/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesHL93685/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL079424-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesHL79424/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesHL51045/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL051045/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesR37 HL051045-15/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"England","J Cell Mol Med","Journal of cellular and molecular medicine","101083777","0 (Blood Glucose)0 (HSP20 Heat-Shock Proteins)0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)EC 3.6.3.14 (Proton-Translocating ATPases)EC 4.2.1.17 (Enoyl-CoA Hydratase)","IM","AnimalsBlood Glucose/analysisBody WeightDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*physiopathologyEnoyl-CoA Hydratase/*physiologyHSP20 Heat-Shock Proteins/*physiologyMaleMiceMice, Inbred C57BLMitochondrial Proteins/*physiologyMyocardial Reperfusion Injury/*physiopathologyProton-Translocating ATPases/*physiologySpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization","PMC3204159","NIHMS309063",NA,NA,NA,"2011/07/05 06:00","2012/10/27 06:00","2012/04/01","2011/07/05 06:00","2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]2012/10/27 06:00 [medline]2012/04/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01376.x [doi]","ppublish","J Cell Mol Med. 2012 Apr;16(4):950-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01376.x.","© 2011 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine © 2011 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",NA,NA,"10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01376.x",NA,2012

However, its mechanism of action is still unclear at the metabolic level. In this study, the biochemical markers from type 2 DM (T2DM) rats, induced by a high-sugar and high-fat diet combined with streptozotocin (STZ), were detected. The metabolomics-based analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was conducted to evaluate urine samples from control, model, metformin, and HD groups. After oral administration of HD for 28 days, the general state, weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood lipid level, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), fasting insulin (FINS), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were significantly improved (P < 0.01). The western blotting showed that HD can enhance the protein expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The metabolomics results revealed that after treatment with HD, the levels of L-carnitine, 1-methyladenosine, 1-methylhistamine, and 3-indoleacrylic acid were upregulated and the levels of riboflavin, phenylalanine, atrolactic acid, 2-oxoglutarate, citrate, isocitrate, cortisol, and glucose were downregulated. The main mechanism may be closely related to the regulation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, phenylalanine metabolism, glyoxylate metabolism, and dicarboxylate metabolism. Additionally, it was also found that HD can regulate the protein expression of GLUT4 and AMPK to interfere with TCA cycle and carbohydrate metabolism to treat T2DM.","Pan, Lin-LinSun, Qi-HuiLiu, Gui-RongGuo, Jia-Yin","Pan LLSun QHLiu GRAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9827-6811Guo JYAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2596-1356","Department of Chinese Medicine Literature and Culture, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan 250355, China.Department of Pharmacy, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan 250355, China.Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan 250355, China.Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of New Drug Screening, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20191030","United States","Evid Based Complement Alternat Med","Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM","101215021",NA,NA,NA,"PMC6925725",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare that have no conflicts of interest.","2019/12/31 06:00","2019/12/31 06:01","2019/10/30","2019/12/31 06:00","2019/05/18 00:00 [received]2019/09/14 00:00 [revised]2019/09/19 00:00 [accepted]2019/12/31 06:00 [entrez]2019/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]2019/12/31 06:01 [medline]2019/10/30 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1155/2019/1394641 [doi]","epublish","Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2019 Oct 30;2019:1394641. doi: 10.1155/2019/1394641. eCollection 2019.","Copyright © 2019 Lin-Lin Pan et al.",NA,NA,"10.1155/2019/1394641",NA,2019

Whether these perturbations extend to other tissues and contribute to their pathophysiology is less well established. The objective of this study was to investigate platelet mitochondria to evaluate whether type 2 diabetes associated mitochondrial dysfunction is evident in circulating cells. METHOD: A pilot study of mitochondrial respiratory function and proteomic changes comparing platelets extracted from insulin sensitive (n=8) and type 2 diabetic subjects (n=7). RESULTS: In-situ platelet mitochondria show diminished oxygen consumption and lower oxygen-dependent ATP synthesis in diabetic vs. control subjects. Mass spectrometric identification and confirmatory immunoblot analysis identifies induction of the mitochondrial anti-oxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase 2 and thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase 3 in platelets of diabetic subjects. As oxidative stress upregulates anti-oxidant enzymes we assessed mitochondrial protein carbonylation as an index of oxidative-stress. Platelets of diabetic subjects exhibit significantly increased protein carbonylation compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: As platelets are anuclear fragments of megakaryocytes, our data suggest that the bone marrow compartment in type 2 diabetic subjects is exposed to increased mitochondrial oxidative stress with upregulation of nuclear-encoded antioxidant mitochondrial enzymes. This 'stress-signature' in platelets of diabetic subjects is associated with a diminution of their mitochondrial contribution to energy production and support that mitochondrial perturbations in type 2 diabetes extends beyond the classical insulin responsive tissues. Platelets, as ""accessible human tissue"", may be useful to measure the mitochondrial modulatory effects of emerging anti-diabetic therapeutics.","Avila, CHuang, R JStevens, M VAponte, A MTripodi, DKim, K YSack, M N","Avila CHuang RJStevens MVAponte AMTripodi DKim KYSack MN","Center for Molecular Medicine, NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.","eng","Z01 HL005199-01/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, N.I.H., Intramural","20110915","Germany","Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes","Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association","9505926","0 (Antioxidants)0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)","IM","AdultAntioxidants/pharmacologyBlood Platelets/metabolism/physiology/ultrastructureCase-Control StudiesCell Respiration/drug effects/physiologyDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*metabolism/physiopathologyFemaleHeat-Shock Proteins/analysis/*metabolismHumansMaleMiddle AgedMitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/*physiologyMitochondrial Proteins/analysis/metabolismOxidative Stress/drug effects/physiologyOxygen Consumption/drug effects/physiologyPilot Projects*Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effectsProteomics/methods","PMC6122851","NIHMS986178",NA,NA,"Conflict of interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest associated with this manuscript.","2011/09/17 06:00","2012/09/06 06:00","2018/09/04","2011/09/17 06:00","2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]2012/09/06 06:00 [medline]2018/09/04 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1055/s-0031-1285833 [doi]","ppublish","Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes. 2012 Apr;120(4):248-51. doi: 10.1055/s-0031-1285833.

Resistant starch 3 (RS3), as a starch resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis owing to its special structure, has a good effect on improving insulin resistance and reducing blood sugar in T2DM patients. However, the possible mechanisms were barely interpreted yet. In our research, we aimed to evaluate the effects and the possible mechanisms of RS3 on the treatment of T2DM. ICR mice treated with high-fat diet (HFD) for eight weeks, and then injected with streptozotocin (STZ) (100 mg/kg) to establish the T2DM. We choose the mice with the fast blood glucose (FBG) more than 11 mmol/L as T2DM. After treated for 11 weeks the relevant data was analyzed. According to the results, the FBG was dramatically reduced (p < 0.05), which also downregulated triglyceride (p < 0.01) and total cholesterol (p < 0.01). Additionally, the insulin resistance indexes were significantly reduced (p < 0.01), the homeostasis model assessment-β and insulin-sensitive index were significantly improved (p < 0.01) in RS3 group. Meanwhile, the metabolic profiles of urine were analyzed and 29 potential biomarkers were screened out, including amino acids and lipids. In conclusion, we speculated that the tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism played roles in the therapeutic mechanisms of RS3 on T2DM.","Zhang, CaijuanDong, LingWu, JiahuiQiao, SanyangXu, WenjuanMa, ShuangshuangZhao, BaoshengWang, Xueyong","Zhang CDong LWu JQiao SXu WMa SZhao BWang X","Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Northeast Corner of Intersection of Sunshine South Street and Baiyang East Road, Fang-Shan District, Beijing, 102488, China.Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Northeast Corner of Intersection of Sunshine South Street and Baiyang East Road, Fang-Shan District, Beijing, 102488, China.Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Northeast Corner of Intersection of Sunshine South Street and Baiyang East Road, Fang-Shan District, Beijing, 102488, China.Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Northeast Corner of Intersection of Sunshine South Street and Baiyang East Road, Fang-Shan District, Beijing, 102488, China.Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Northeast Corner of Intersection of Sunshine South Street and Baiyang East Road, Fang-Shan District, Beijing, 102488, China.Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Northeast Corner of Intersection of Sunshine South Street and Baiyang East Road, Fang-Shan District, Beijing, 102488, China.Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Northeast Corner of Intersection of Sunshine South Street and Baiyang East Road, Fang-Shan District, Beijing, 102488, China.Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Northeast Corner of Intersection of Sunshine South Street and Baiyang East Road, Fang-Shan District, Beijing, 102488, China.

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the progression of diabetic nephropathy in GK rats remain unclear. Kidneys from 15-week old male diabetic GK/Jcl rats and age-matched Wistar rats, which have the same genetic background as GK rats, were used. Proteomic analyses of GK and Wistar kidneys were performed using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Differentially expressed proteins in GK rats were subjected to pathway analysis, and expression levels of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and fumarate accumulation in GK kidneys were examined. Azan staining and immunohistochemical staining of α-smooth muscle actin were performed in relation to fibrosis in GK kidneys. Proteomic analysis using 2D-DIGE, analysis of fumarate content, and expression analysis of HIF-1α, TGF-β1, and α-smooth muscle actin of GK rat's kidney, suggested the mechanism of fibrosis characterized as two stages in diabetic nephropathy of GK rats. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism such as elevated levels of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and reduction of fumarate hydratase caused the accumulation of fumarate followed by the upregulation of HIF-1α and TGF-β1 leading to fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy. Alterations in proteins involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle are associated with fibrosis through fumarate accumulation in diabetic nephropathy of GK rats.","Miura, YuriHayakawa, AtsukoKikuchi, ShoheiTsumoto, HirokiUmezawa, KeitaroChiba, YukoSoejima, YurieSawabe, MotojiFukui, KojiAkimoto, YoshihiroEndo, Tamao","Miura YHayakawa AKikuchi STsumoto HUmezawa KChiba YSoejima YSawabe MFukui KAkimoto YEndo T","Research Team for Mechanism of Aging, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology, 35-2 Sakae-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-0015, Japan.

Microalbuminuria has been used as a diagnostic marker of diabetic nephropathy. But owing to its insufficient sensitivity and specificity, other biomarkers are being sought. In addition, the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy is not fully understood and declines in renal function occur even without microalbuminuria. In this study, we investigated urinary proteins from three study groups (controls, and type 2 diabetic subjects with or without microalbuminuria). Non-targeted label-free Nano-LC QTOF analysis was conducted to discover underlying mechanisms and protein networks, and targeted label-free Nano-LC QTOF with SWATH was performed to qualify discovered protein candidates. Twenty-eight proteins were identified as candidates and functionally analyzed via String DB, gene ontology and pathway analysis. Four predictive mechanisms were analyzed: i) response to stimulus, ii) platelet activation, signaling and aggregation, iii) ECM-receptor interaction, and iv) angiogenesis. These mechanisms can provoke kidney dysfunction in type 2 diabetic patients via endothelial cell damage and glomerulus structural alteration. Based on these analyses, three proteins (kininogen-1, basement membrane-specific heparan sulfate proteoglycan core protein, and roundabout homolog 4) were proposed for further study as potential biomarkers. Our findings provide insights that may improve methods for both prevention and diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy.","Na Nakorn, PiyadaPannengpetch, SupitchaIsarankura-Na-Ayudhya, PatchareeThippakorn, ChadineeLawung, RatanaSathirapongsasuti, NuankanyaKitiyakara, ChagriyaSritara, PiyamitrVathesatogkit, PrinIsarankura-Na-Ayudhya, Chartchalerm","Na Nakorn PPannengpetch SIsarankura-Na-Ayudhya PThippakorn CLawung RSathirapongsasuti NKitiyakara CSritara PVathesatogkit PIsarankura-Na-Ayudhya C","Department of Clinical Microbiology and Applied Technology, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.Center for Research and Innovation, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Nakornpathom, Thailand.Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Thammasat University, Pathumthani, Thailand.Center for Research and Innovation, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Nakornpathom, Thailand.Department of Clinical Microbiology and Applied Technology, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.Section for Translational Medicine, Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.Department of Clinical Microbiology and Applied Technology, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20200624","Germany","EXCLI J","EXCLI journal","101299402",NA,NA,NA,"PMC7355151",NA,"NOTNLM","diabetic nephropathyquantitative proteomicsurine",NA,"2020/07/16 06:00","2020/07/16 06:01","2020/06/24","2020/07/16 06:00","2020/05/04 00:00 [received]2020/06/15 00:00 [accepted]2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]2020/07/16 06:01 [medline]2020/06/24 00:00 [pmc-release]","2020-1396 [pii]Doc872 [pii]10.17179/excli2020-1396 [doi]","epublish","EXCLI J. 2020 Jun 24;19:872-891. doi: 10.17179/excli2020-1396. eCollection 2020.","Copyright © 2020 Na Nakorn et al.",NA,NA,"10.17179/excli2020-1396",NA,2020

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cellular response to insulin. Recently, ER stress has been known to reduce the insulin sensitivity of the liver and lead to type 2 diabetes. However, detailed mechanisms of ER stress response that leads to type 2 diabetes remains unknown. To obtain a global view of ER function in type 2 diabetic liver and identify proteins that may be responsible for hepatic ER stress and insulin resistance, we performed proteomics analysis of mouse liver ER using nano UPLC-MSE. A total of 1584 proteins were identified in control C57 and type 2 diabetic db/db mice livers. Comparison of the rER and sER proteomes from normal mice showed that proteins involved in protein synthesis and metabolic process were enriched in the rER, while those associated with transport and cellular homeostasis were localized to the sER. In addition, proteins involved in protein folding and ER stress were found only in the rER. In the livers of db/db mice, however, the functions of the rER and sER were severely disrupted, including the capacity to resolve ER stress. These results provide new insight into the research on hepatic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and are suggestive of the potential use of the differentially expressed hepatic ER proteins as biomarkers for hepatic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.","Park, Edmond ChangkyunKim, Gun-HwaYun, Sung-HoLim, Hye LiHong, YeonheeKwon, Sang-OhKwon, JosephChung, Young-HoKim, Seung Il","Park ECKim GHYun SHLim HLHong YKwon SOKwon JChung YHKim SI","Division of Life Science, Korea Basic Science Institute, Daejeon 305-806, Korea. chungyh@kbsi.re.kr.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20121217","Switzerland","Int J Mol Sci","International journal of molecular sciences","101092791","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Proteome)","IM","AnimalsBiomarkers/metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/genetics/*metabolism/pathologyEndoplasmic Reticulum/genetics/*metabolism/pathology*Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress*Insulin ResistanceLiver/*metabolism/pathologyMiceMice, Mutant StrainsProteome/*metabolism","PMC3546747",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2012/12/19 06:00","2012/12/19 06:01","2012/01/01","2012/12/19 06:00","2012/09/27 00:00 [received]2012/11/30 00:00 [revised]2012/12/12 00:00 [accepted]2012/12/19 06:00 [entrez]2012/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]2012/12/19 06:01 [medline]2012/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","ijms131217230 [pii]ijms-13-17230 [pii]10.3390/ijms131217230 [doi]","epublish","Int J Mol Sci. 2012 Dec 17;13(12):17230-43. doi: 10.3390/ijms131217230.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/ijms131217230",NA,2012

Diabetic nephropathy is also associated with an increased risk of vascular disease and patient mortality. Aggressive management of hypertension to reduce microalbuminuria, together with tight glycaemic control are important therapeutic strategies for renal and vascular disease prevention in T2D. The main pathophysiological mechanisms associated with diabetic nephropathy result from activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), protein kinase C pathway, pro-inflammatory cytokines and various growth factors. Angiotensin II and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) are two important molecular mediators. The production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and increased oxidative stress further exacerbates renal injury. These molecular changes within the renal tissue result in mesangial expansion, increased extracellular matrix deposition and an alteration in podocyte structure and function. Therapeutic targeting of these molecular pathways is an important area of translational research in diabetes. The elucidation of new genetic associations and proteomic biomarkers of diabetic kidney disease will also assist in the identification and treatment of high-risk patients.

Coimmunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells showed that MR is a target of O-GlcNAc modification (O-GlcNAcylation). The expression levels and transcriptional activities of the receptor increased in parallel with its O-GlcNAcylation under high-glucose conditions. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed O-GlcNAcylation of the MR at amino acids 295-307. Point mutations in those residues decreased O-GlcNAcylation, and both the protein levels and transcriptional activities of MR. In db/db mouse kidneys, MR protein levels increased in parallel with overall O-GlcNAc levels of the tissue, accompanied by increased SGK1 mRNA levels. The administration of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucin, an inhibitor of O-GlcNAcylation, reduced tissue O-GlcNAc levels and MR protein levels in db/db mice. Thus, our study showed that O-GlcNAcylation of the MR directly increases protein levels and transcriptional activities of the receptor under high-glucose conditions in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide a novel mechanism of MR as a target for prevention of complications associated with diabetes mellitus.","Jo, RieShibata, HirotakaKurihara, IsaoYokota, KenichiKobayashi, SakikoMurai-Takeda, AyanoMitsuishi, YukoHayashi, TakeshiNakamura, ToshifumiItoh, Hiroshi","Jo RShibata HKurihara IYokota KKobayashi SMurai-Takeda AMitsuishi YHayashi TNakamura TItoh H","Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.Keiyu Hospital, Kanagawa, Japan.Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan. hiro-405@cb3.so-net.ne.jp.Department of Endocrinology, Metabolism, Rheumatology and Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Oita, Japan. hiro-405@cb3.so-net.ne.jp.Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.Department of Medical Education, National Defense Medical College, Saitama, Japan.Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.Health Center, Keio University, Kanagawa, Japan.Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.Center of Preventive Medicine, Keio University Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.Hayashi Clinic, Tokyo, Japan.Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20221014","England","Hypertens Res","Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension","9307690","V956696549 (Acetylglucosamine)0 (Receptors, Mineralocorticoid)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IMCIN  Hypertens Res. 2023 Jan;46(1):261-263. doi: 10.1038/s41440-022-01107-8.

Acute admission hyperglycemia (AH) is a transient glucose alteration in response to stress. As glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reflects the glycemia over a longer period of time, its use may be helpful in distinguishing between the AH and hyperglycemia associated with T2D in the AMI setting. The aim was to assess the correlation of ceramides with both AH (defined as an admission glucose level ≥140 mg/dL in the absence of T2D) and HbA1c-T2D and other demographic, clinical, and inflammatory-related biomarkers in AMI. High-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify nine ceramide species, and their three ratios, in 140 AMI patients (FTGM coronary unit, Massa, Italy). The ceramides did not correlate with stress hyperglycemia, but specific species were elevated in T2D-AMI. Moreover, some ceramides were associated with other cardiometabolic risk factors. Ceramides assessment may be helpful in better understanding the pathogenic molecular mechanisms underlying myocardial acute events and cardiometabolic risk, as a basis for the future evaluation of their role as prognostic predictors and therapeutic targets in T2D-AMI patients.","Gaggini, MelaniaMichelucci, ElenaNdreu, RudinaRocchiccioli, SilviaChatzianagnostou, KyriazoulaBerti, SergioVassalle, Cristina","Gaggini MAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6311-502XMichelucci EAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1619-401XNdreu RAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-1198-9822Rocchiccioli SAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3831-4200Chatzianagnostou KAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7247-1982Berti SAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5244-0556Vassalle CAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3438-6450","Institute of Clinical Physiology, National Research Council, Via G.

This study aims to predict the structural stability, and functional impacts on variations in non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) in the human SLC30A8 gene using various computational techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Several in silico tools, including SIFT, Predict-SNP, SNPs&GO, MAPP, SNAP2, PhD-SNP, PANTHER, PolyPhen-1,PolyPhen-2, I-Mutant 2.0, and MUpro, have been used in our study. RESULTS: After data analysis, out of 336 missenses, the eight nsSNPs, namely R138Q, I141N, W136G, I349N, L303R, E140A, W306C, and L308Q, were discovered by ConSurf to be in highly conserved regions, which could affect the stability of their proteins. Project HOPE determines any significant molecular effects on the structure and function of eight mutated proteins and the three-dimensional (3D) structures of these proteins. The two pharmacologically significant compounds, Luzonoid B and Roseoside demonstrate strong binding affinity to the mutant proteins, and they are more efficient in inhibiting them than the typical SLC30A8 protein using Autodock Vina and Chimera. Increased binding affinity to mutant SLC30A8 proteins has been determined not to influence drug resistance. Ultimately, the Kaplan-Meier plotter study revealed that alterations in SLC30A8 gene expression notably affect the survival rates of patients with various cancer types. CONCLUSION: Finally, the study found eight highly deleterious missense nsSNPs in the SLC30A8 gene that can be helpful for further proteomic and genomic studies for T2D and colorectal cancer diagnosis. These findings also pave the way for personalized treatments using biomarkers and more effective healthcare strategies.","Uddin, Md MoinHossain, Md TanvirHossain, Md ArjuAhsan, AsifShamim, Kamrul HasanHossen, Md ArifRahman, Md ShahinurRahman, Md HabiburAhmed, KawsarBui, Francis MAl-Zahrani, Fahad Ahmed","Uddin MMHossain MTHossain MAAhsan AShamim KHHossen MARahman MSRahman MHAhmed KBui FMAl-Zahrani FA","Department of Biotechnology, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh.Department of Biotechnology, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh.Department of Microbiology, Primeasia University, Banani, Dhaka 1213, Bangladesh.Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, Santosh, Tangail 1902, Bangladesh.Department of Biotechnology, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh 2202, Bangladesh.Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, Santosh, Tangail 1902, Bangladesh.Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, Santosh, Tangail 1902, Bangladesh.Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Pabna Diabetic Association Hospital, Pabna 6600, Bangladesh.Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Islamic University, Kushtia 7003, Bangladesh.Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, 57 Campus Drive, Saskatoon, SK, S7N 5A9, Canada.Group of Biophotomatiχ, Department of Information and Communication Technology, Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, Santosh, Tangail 1902, Bangladesh.Health Informatics Research Lab, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Daffodil International University, Daffodil Smart City (DSC), Birulia, Savar, Dhaka-1216, Bangladesh.Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, 57 Campus Drive, Saskatoon, SK, S7N 5A9, Canada.Department of Computer Engineering, Umm Al-Qura University, Mecca 24381, Saudi Arabia.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240831","England","Heliyon","Heliyon","101672560",NA,NA,NA,"PMC11408818",NA,"NOTNLM","And colorectal cancerMissenseNon-synonymousPolymorphismSLC30A8T2D","The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.","2024/09/19 06:43","2024/09/19 06:44","2024/08/31","2024/09/19 04:51","2024/05/23 00:00 [received]2024/08/29 00:00 [revised]2024/08/30 00:00 [accepted]2024/09/19 06:44 [medline]2024/09/19 06:43 [pubmed]2024/09/19 04:51 [entrez]2024/08/31 00:00 [pmc-release]","S2405-8440(24)13311-7 [pii]e37280 [pii]10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e37280 [doi]","epublish","Heliyon. 2024 Aug 31;10(17):e37280. doi: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e37280. eCollection 2024 Sep 15.","© 2024 The Authors.",NA,NA,"10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e37280",NA,2024

Detection of patients who are prone to develop micro or macroalbuminuria may represent an effective strategy to start or optimise therapeutic intervention. Here we assessed the value of a urinary proteomic-based risk score (classifier) in predicting the development and progression of microalbuminuria. METHODS: We conducted a prospective case-control study. Cases (n = 44) and controls (n = 44) were selected from the PREVEND (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease) study and from the Steno Diabetes Center (Gentofte, Denmark). Cases were defined by transition from normo to microalbuminuria or from micro to macroalbuminuria over a follow-up of 3 years. Controls with no transitions in albuminuria were pair-matched for age, sex and albuminuria status. A model for the progression of albuminuria was built using a proteomic classifier based on 273 urinary peptides. RESULTS: The proteomic classifier was independently associated with transition to micro or macroalbuminuria (OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.02, 1.79], p = 0.035). The classifier predicted the development and progression of albuminuria on top of albuminuria and estimated GFR (eGFR, area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve increase of 0.03, p = 0.002; integrated discrimination index [IDI]: 0.105, p = 0.002). Fragments of collagen and α-2-HS-glycoprotein showed significantly different expression between cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Although limited by the relatively small sample size, these results suggest that analysis of a urinary biomarker set enables early renal risk assessment in patients with diabetes. Further work is required to confirm the role of urinary proteomics in the prevention of renal failure in diabetes.","Roscioni, S Sde Zeeuw, DHellemons, M EMischak, HZürbig, PBakker, S J LGansevoort, R TReinhard, HPersson, FLajer, MRossing, PLambers Heerspink, H J","Roscioni SSde Zeeuw DHellemons MEMischak HZürbig PBakker SJGansevoort RTReinhard HPersson FLajer MRossing PLambers Heerspink HJ","Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Antonius Deusinglaan 1, Groningen, the Netherlands. s.s.roscioni@umcg.nl","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20121020","Germany","Diabetologia","Diabetologia","0006777","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Peptides)","IM","AgedAlbuminuria/pathology/*urineBiomarkers/*urineCase-Control StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/pathology/*urineFemaleHumansMaleMiddle AgedPeptides/*urineProspective StudiesProteomics/methods",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2012/10/23 06:00","2013/06/13 06:00",NA,"2012/10/23 06:00","2012/07/17 00:00 [received]2012/09/26 00:00 [accepted]2012/10/23 06:00 [entrez]2012/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]2013/06/13 06:00 [medline]","10.1007/s00125-012-2755-2 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetologia. 2013 Feb;56(2):259-67. doi: 10.1007/s00125-012-2755-2.

METHODS: Proteomic surveying and accurate quantitative measurement of selected proteins from plasma samples collected from the patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who gave birth of either healthy or affected by maternal diabetes newborns was performed using mass spectrometry. RESULTS: We determined and quantitatively measured several proteins, including CRP, CEACAM1, CNDP1 and Ig-family that were significantly differed in patients that gave birth of newborns with signs of DF. We found that patients with newborns associated with DF are characterized by significantly decreased CEACAM1 (113.18 ± 16.23 ng/mL and 81.09 ± 10.54 ng/mL in GDM and T2DM, p < 0.005) in contrast to control group (515.6 ± 72.14 ng/mL, p < 0.005). On the contrary, the concentration of CNDP1 was increased in DF-associated groups and attained 49.3 ± 5.18 ng/mL and 37.7 ± 3.34 ng/mL (p < 0.005) in GDM and T2DM groups, respectively. Among other proteins, dramatically decreased concentration of IgG4 and IgA2 subclasses of immunoglobulins were noticed. CONCLUSION: The combination of the measured markers may assist (AUC = 0.893 (CI 95%, 0.785-0.980) in establishing the clinical finding of the developing DF especially in patients with GDM who are at the highest risk of chronic insulin resistance.","Kopylov, Arthur TKaysheva, Anna LPapysheva, OlgaGribova, IvetaKotaysch, GalinaKharitonova, LubovMayatskaya, TatianaKrasheninnikova, AnnaMorozov, Sergey G","Kopylov ATAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7199-372XKaysheva ALAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4472-2016Papysheva OGribova IKotaysch GKharitonova LMayatskaya TKrasheninnikova AMorozov SG","Department of Pathology, Institute of General Pathology and Pathophysiology, 125315 Moscow, Russia.Department of Proteomic Researches, Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, 119121 Moscow, Russia.Department of Proteomic Researches, Institute of Biomedical Chemistry, 119121 Moscow, Russia.Perinatal Center, Sergey S.

It is therefore of critical importance the early diagnosis of DM2 patients and the detection of those at increased risk of disease. In this respect, Precision Medicine (PM) is an emerging approach that includes practices, tests, decisions and treatments adapted to the characteristics of each patient. With regard to DM2, PM manages a wealth of ""omics"" data (genomic, metabolic, proteomic, environmental, clinical and paraclinical) to increase the number of clinically validated biomarkers in order to identify patients in early stage even before the prediabetic phase. SIGNIFICANCE: In this paper, we discuss the epidemic dimension of metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and the urgent demand for novel biomarkers to reduce the incidence or even delay the onset of DM2. Recent research data produced by ""multi-omics"" technologies (genomics/epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics), suggest that many potential biomarkers might be helpful in the prediction and early diagnosis of DM2. Predictive, Preventive and Personalized Medicine (PPPM) manages and integrates these data to apply personalized, preventive, and therapeutic approaches. This is significant because there is an emerging need for establishing channels for communication and personalized consultation between systems research and precision medicine, as the medicine of the future.","Kraniotou, ChristinaKaradima, VasilikiBellos, GeorgeTsangaris, George Th","Kraniotou CKaradima VBellos GTsangaris GT","Koropi Health Centre, 19400 Attica, Greece.

Adipose stem cells (ASCs) showed promising potency in improving type 2 diabetes and its complications through their immunomodulatory and differentiation capabilities. However, the hyperglycaemia of the diabetic microenvironment may exert a detrimental effect on the functionality of ASCs. Herein, we investigate ASC homeostasis and regenerative potential in the diabetic milieu. METHODS: We conducted data collection and functional enrichment analysis to investigate the differential gene expression profile of MSCs in the diabetic microenvironment. Next, ASCs were cultured in a medium containing diabetic serum (DS) or normal non-diabetic serum (NS) for six days and one-month periods. Proteomic analysis was carried out, and ASCs were then evaluated for apoptosis, changes in the expression of surface markers and DNA repair genes, intracellular oxidative stress, and differentiation capacity. The crosstalk between the ASCs and the diabetic microenvironment was determined by the expression of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines and cytokine receptors. RESULTS: The enrichment of MSCs differentially expressed genes in diabetes points to an alteration in oxidative stress regulating pathways in MSCs. Next, proteomic analysis of ASCs in DS revealed differentially expressed proteins that are related to enhanced cellular apoptosis, DNA damage and oxidative stress, altered immunomodulatory and differentiation potential. Our experiments confirmed these data and showed that ASCs cultured in DS suffered apoptosis, intracellular oxidative stress, and defective DNA repair. Under diabetic conditions, ASCs also showed compromised osteogenic, adipogenic, and angiogenic differentiation capacities. Both pro and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression were significantly altered by culture of ASCs in DS denoting defective immunomodulatory potential. Interestingly, ASCs showed induction of antioxidative stress genes and proteins such as SIRT1, TERF1, Clusterin and PKM2. CONCLUSION: We propose that this deterioration in the regenerative function of ASCs is partially mediated by the induced oxidative stress and the diabetic inflammatory milieu. The induction of antioxidative stress factors in ASCs may indicate an adaptation mechanism to the increased oxidative stress in the diabetic microenvironment.","Ahmed, Sara MElkhenany, Hoda AAhmed, Toka AGhoneim, Nehal IElkodous, Mohamed AbdMohamed, Rania HassanMagdeldin, SamehOsama, AyaAnwar, Ali MostafaGabr, Mahmoud MEl-Badri, Nagwa","Ahmed SMElkhenany HAAhmed TAGhoneim NIElkodous MAMohamed RHMagdeldin SOsama AAnwar AMGabr MMEl-Badri N","Center of Excellence for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine (CESC), Zewail City of Science and Technology, 6th of October City, Sheikh Zayed District, 6th of October City , 12582, Giza, Egypt.Center of Excellence for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine (CESC), Zewail City of Science and Technology, 6th of October City, Sheikh Zayed District, 6th of October City , 12582, Giza, Egypt.Department of surgery, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt.Center of Excellence for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine (CESC), Zewail City of Science and Technology, 6th of October City, Sheikh Zayed District, 6th of October City , 12582, Giza, Egypt.Center of Excellence for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine (CESC), Zewail City of Science and Technology, 6th of October City, Sheikh Zayed District, 6th of October City , 12582, Giza, Egypt.Center of Excellence for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine (CESC), Zewail City of Science and Technology, 6th of October City, Sheikh Zayed District, 6th of October City , 12582, Giza, Egypt.Center of Excellence for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine (CESC), Zewail City of Science and Technology, 6th of October City, Sheikh Zayed District, 6th of October City , 12582, Giza, Egypt.Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.Proteomic and Metabolomics Research Program, Basic Research Department, Children's Cancer Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.Department of Physiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, 41522, Egypt.Proteomic and Metabolomics Research Program, Basic Research Department, Children's Cancer Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.Proteomic and Metabolomics Research Program, Basic Research Department, Children's Cancer Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.Urology and Nephrology Center, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.Center of Excellence for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine (CESC), Zewail City of Science and Technology, 6th of October City, Sheikh Zayed District, 6th of October City , 12582, Giza, Egypt. nelbadri@zewailcity.edu.eg.Center of Excellence for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine (CESC), Zewail City of Science and Technology, Sheikh Zayed District, Giza 12588, 6th of October City, Egypt. nelbadri@zewailcity.edu.eg.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240616","England","Diabetol Metab Syndr","Diabetology & metabolic syndrome","101488958",NA,NA,NA,"PMC11181634",NA,"NOTNLM","Adipose stem cellsAngiogenesisDiabetes mellitusDiabetic patientsDiabetic serumMetabolic activityType 2 diabetes","The authors declare no competing interests.","2024/06/17 00:42","2024/06/17 00:43","2024/06/16","2024/06/16 23:15","2024/02/28 00:00 [received]2024/05/29 00:00 [accepted]2024/06/17 00:43 [medline]2024/06/17 00:42 [pubmed]2024/06/16 23:15 [entrez]2024/06/16 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1186/s13098-024-01365-1 [pii]1365 [pii]10.1186/s13098-024-01365-1 [doi]","epublish","Diabetol Metab Syndr. 2024 Jun 16;16(1):131. doi: 10.1186/s13098-024-01365-1.","© 2024.

The aim of this study was to identify novel T2D-associated proteins in Mexican patients. Blood samples were collected from 62 Mexican patients with T2D and they were grouped according to their body mass index(BMI). A panel of 10 diabetes and obesity serum markers was determined using MAGPIX. A comparative proteomics study was performed using two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis(2D-DIGE) followed by mass spectrometry(LC-MS/MS). We detected 113 spots differentially accumulated, in which 64 unique proteins were identified, proteins that were involved in metabolism pathways, molecular transport, and cellular signalling. Four proteins(14-3-3, ApoH, ZAG, and OTO3) showing diabetes-related variation and also changes in relation to obesity were selected for further validation by western blotting. Our results reveal new diabetes related proteins present in the Mexican population. These could provide additional insight into the understanding of diabetes development in Mexican population and may also be useful candidate biomarkers.","Gómez-Cardona, Erik EHernández-Domínguez, Eric EVelarde-Salcedo, Aída JPacheco, Alberto-Barrera-Diaz-Gois, AgustínDe León-Rodríguez, AntonioBarba de la Rosa, Ana P","Gómez-Cardona EEHernández-Domínguez EEVelarde-Salcedo AJPacheco ABDiaz-Gois ADe León-Rodríguez ABarba de la Rosa AP","IPICyT, Instituto Potosino de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica A.C.

It is possible that novel markers portraying the pathophysiological underpinning processes may be useful.Aim: To investigate the associations between 80 circulating proteins, measured by a proximity extension assay, and prevalent DKD and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in type 2 diabetes.Methods: We randomly divided individuals with type 2 diabetes from three cohorts into a two-thirds discovery and one-third replication set (total n = 813, of whom 231 had DKD defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mg/mL/1.73 m(2) and/or urinary albumin-creatinine ratio ≥3 g/mol). Proteins associated with DKD were also assessed as predictors for incident major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in persons with DKD at baseline.Results: Four proteins were positively associated with DKD in models adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, glucose control, and diabetes medication: kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1, odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation increment, 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-2.14); growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15, OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.16-1.69); myoglobin (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.30-1.91), and matrix metalloproteinase 10 (MMP-10, OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.17-1.74). In patients with DKD, GDF-15 was significantly associated with increased risk of MACE after adjustments for baseline age, sex, microalbuminuria, and kidney function and (59 MACE events during 7 years follow-up, hazard ratio per standard deviation increase 1.43 [95% CI 1.03-1.98]) but not after further adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors.Conclusion: Our proteomics approach confirms and extends previous associations of higher circulating levels of GDF-15 with both micro and macrovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our data encourage additional studies evaluating the clinical utility of our findings.","Carlsson, Axel CNowak, ChristophLind, LarsÖstgren, Carl JohanNyström, Fredrik HSundström, JohanCarrero, Juan JesusRiserus, UlfIngelsson, ErikFall, ToveÄrnlöv, Johan","Carlsson ACNowak CLind LÖstgren CJNyström FHSundström JCarrero JJRiserus UAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8620-4586Ingelsson EFall TÄrnlöv J","Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society (NVS), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society (NVS), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Department of Public Health and Caring Sciences, Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Stanford Diabetes Research Center, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.Molecular Epidemiology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Molecular Epidemiology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society (NVS), Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.School of Health and Social Studies, Dalarna University, Falun, Sweden.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20191205","Sweden","Ups J Med Sci","Upsala journal of medical sciences","0332203","0 (Biomarkers)0 (GDF15 protein, human)0 (Growth Differentiation Factor 15)","IM","AgedBiomarkers/metabolismCardiovascular Diseases/complications/*metabolismCohort StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complicationsDiabetic Nephropathies/*metabolism/physiopathologyFemaleGlomerular Filtration RateGrowth Differentiation Factor 15/*metabolismHumansMaleMiddle AgedProteomics/*methodsRisk FactorsSweden","PMC7054929",NA,"NOTNLM","Albumin-creatinine ratiobiomarkerdiabetic kidney diseaseglomerular filtration rateproteomicsrisk factortype 2 diabetes mellitus",NA,"2019/12/07 06:00","2020/12/15 06:00","2019/12/05","2019/12/07 06:00","2019/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]2019/12/07 06:00 [entrez]2019/12/05 00:00 [pmc-release]","1696430 [pii]10.1080/03009734.2019.1696430 [doi]","ppublish","Ups J Med Sci. 2020 Feb;125(1):37-43. doi: 10.1080/03009734.2019.1696430.

Using the eight founder strains and both sexes of the Collaborative Cross (C57BL/6J (B6), A/J, 129S1/SvImJ (129), NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD), NZO/HILtJ (NZO), PWK/PhJ (PWK), WSB/EiJ (WSB), and CAST/EiJ (CAST)), we investigated the genetic dependence of diabetes-related metabolic phenotypes and insulin secretion. We found that strain background is associated with an extraordinary range in body weight, plasma glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and insulin secretion. Our whole-islet proteomic analysis of the eight mouse strains demonstrates that genetic background exerts a strong influence on the islet proteome that can be linked to the differences in diabetes-related metabolic phenotypes and insulin secretion. We computed protein modules consisting of highly correlated proteins that enrich for biological pathways and provide a searchable database of the islet protein expression profiles. To validate the data resource, we identified tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), a key enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, as a protein that is highly expressed in β-cells of PWK and CAST islets. We show that CAST islets synthesize elevated levels of dopamine, which suppresses insulin secretion. Prior studies, using only the B6 strain, concluded that adult mouse islets do not synthesize l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), the product of Th and precursor of dopamine. Thus, the choice of the CAST strain, guided by our islet proteomic survey, was crucial for these discoveries. In summary, we provide a valuable data resource to the research community, and show that proteomic analysis identified a strain-specific pathway by which dopamine synthesized in β-cells inhibits insulin secretion.","Mitok, Kelly AFreiberger, Elyse CSchueler, Kathryn LRabaglia, Mary EStapleton, Donald SKwiecien, Nicholas WMalec, Paige AHebert, Alexander SBroman, Aimee TKennedy, Robert TKeller, Mark PCoon, Joshua JAttie, Alan D","Mitok KAFreiberger ECSchueler KLRabaglia MEStapleton DSKwiecien NWMalec PAHebert ASBroman ATKennedy RTKeller MPCoon JJAttie AD","From the Departments of Biochemistry.From the Departments of Biochemistry.From the Departments of Biochemistry.From the Departments of Biochemistry.From the Departments of Biochemistry.Chemistry, and.the Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109.the Genome Center of Wisconsin, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706 and.Biostatistics and Medical Informatics and.the Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109.From the Departments of Biochemistry.Chemistry, and jcoon@chem.wisc.edu.the Genome Center of Wisconsin, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706 and.From the Departments of Biochemistry, adattie@wisc.edu.","eng","R01 DK101573/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesUL1 TR000427/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United StatesR01 DK046960/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR01 DK102948/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR35 GM118110/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United StatesP41 GM108538/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United StatesP30 DK020572/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20180301","United States","J Biol Chem","The Journal of biological chemistry","2985121R","0 (Proteome)9007-92-5 (Glucagon)VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)","IM","AnimalsDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/genetics/*metabolismDopamine/genetics/*metabolismFemaleGenetic VariationGlucagon/metabolism*Insulin SecretionIslets of Langerhans/*metabolismMaleMice, Inbred C57BLMice, Inbred NODPhenotypeProteome/genetics/*metabolismProteomics","PMC5912463",NA,"NOTNLM","animal modelbeta celldopamineinsulin secretionmass spectrometry (MS)mouse geneticspancreatic isletproteomicstype 2 diabetestyrosine hydroxylase","The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest with the contents of this article","2018/03/03 06:00","2019/01/09 06:00","2019/04/20","2018/03/03 06:00","2017/11/27 00:00 [received]2018/01/29 00:00 [revised]2018/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]2019/01/09 06:00 [medline]2018/03/03 06:00 [entrez]2019/04/20 00:00 [pmc-release]","S0021-9258(20)40940-8 [pii]RA117.001102 [pii]10.1074/jbc.RA117.001102 [doi]","ppublish","J Biol Chem. 2018 Apr 20;293(16):5860-5877. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA117.001102.

How to prevent and cure T2DM has become one of the urgent public health events in China. Numerous studies have demonstrated vitamin D (VitD) was independently correlated with insulin sensitivity and β cells function. VitD deficiency occurs in about 70% to 80% of patients with T2DM. However, the reason of T2DM patients suffering from VitD deficiency is not very clear. The aim of this project is to identify biomarkers to explore potential mechanism of VitD deficiency in patients with T2DM. METHODS: We used the iTRAQ-coupled LC-MS/MS technique to screen differential expression proteins between VitD deficiency group and VitD sufficiency group in T2DM patients. Then we carried out hierarchical clustering analysis, Gene Ontology classification and enrichment analysis, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network (PPI) analysis and ELISA validation. RESULTS: We identified 63 differentially expressed proteins, 17 proteins were up-regulated and 46 proteins were down-regulated (VitD sufficiency vs. VitD deficiency). We ultimately selected four proteins, Podocalyxin (PODXL), ICAM3, MMP9, ApoF for further verification. As a result, the level of MMP9 and ICAM3 was higher in VitD sufficiency group than VitD deficiency group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided a solid theoretical foundation for the study of biomarkers and their mechanisms in most patients with T2DM who suffer from vitamin D deficiency. In addition, MMP9 and ICAM3 may play critical roles in the process of VitD deficiency in T2DM.

Microalbuminuria has been established as a risk factor for the development of diabetic renal disease. Recently, microalbuminuria has been reported to have limitations in determining disease risk and predicting DN. Therefore, identification of more specific biomarkers for prediction of DN is needed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: When kidney damage is initiated, glycoprotein leakage into the blood may occur, thus altering the glycoproteome profile of the blood. Here, we have used a combined approach of glycoprotein enrichment of plasma with a proteomic analysis to discover potential DN biomarkers. We isolated glycoproteins from plasma provided by six type 2 diabetes control (DC) and six type 2 DN patients using multi-lectin affinity chromatography. Captured glycoproteins were resolved by 1-D PAGE and tryptic digests of isolated proteins were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: From the comparative and semi-quantitative proteome analysis, we identified 13 up and 14 down-regulated glycoproteins in DN plasma.

We aim to explore urinary biomarkers that could monitor CAD in type 2 diabetic patients. Materials and Methods. Urine samples from two groups, twenty-eight type 2 diabetic patients with coexisting CAD and thirty type 2 diabetic patients without CAD, were purified by MB-WCX and then analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Subsequently, we compared the urinary peptide signatures of the two groups by use of ClinProTools2.1 and evaluated the potential ability of the differently expressed peptides to distinguish type 2 diabetic patients with coexisting CAD from type 2 diabetic patients without CAD by ROC analysis. Finally, the differently expressed peptides were identified by nanoliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results. There were six differently expressed peptides (m/z 1305.2, 1743.9, 2184.9, 2756.1, 3223.2, and 6196.1) between the two groups of subjects, and they were identified as fragments of isoform 1 of fibrinogen alpha chain precursor, prothrombin precursor, and interalpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4. The diagnostic efficacy of m/z 2756.1 and m/z 3223.2 was better than the other peptides. Area under ROC of the m/z 2756.1, and m/z 3223.2 was 0.98 and 0.93, respectively. Conclusions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out quantitative proteomic analysis using serum samples from 8 and 16-week-old LEA and control Brown Norway (BN) rats (n = 4/group). Differentially expressed proteins were validated by multiple reaction monitoring analysis using the sera collected from 8-, 16-, and 24-week-old LEA (n = 4/each group) and BN rats (n = 5/each group). Among the validated proteins, we also examined the possible relevance of the human homolog of serine protease inhibitor A3 (SERPINA3) to type 2 diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: The use of 2-D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis analysis and the following liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring analysis showed that the serum levels of five proteins were differentially changed between LEA rats and BN rats at all three time-points examined. Among the five proteins, SERPINA3N was increased significantly in the sera of LEA rats compared with age-matched BN rats. The serum level of SERPINA3 was also found to be significantly higher in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients than in healthy control participants. Furthermore, glycated hemoglobin, fasting insulin and estimated glomerular filtration rate were independently associated with the SERPINA3 levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a possible role for SERPINA3 in the development of the early stages of type 2 diabetes mellitus, although further replication studies and functional investigations regarding their role are required.","Takahashi, EriUnoki-Kubota, HiroyukiShimizu, YukikoOkamura, TadashiIwata, WakikoKajio, HiroshiYamamoto-Honda, RitsukoShiga, TomokoYamashita, ShigeoTobe, KazuyukiOkumura, AkinoriMatsumoto, MichihiroYasuda, KazukiNoda, MitsuhikoKaburagi, Yasushi","Takahashi EUnoki-Kubota HAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4827-8805Shimizu YOkamura TIwata WKajio HYamamoto-Honda RShiga TYamashita STobe KOkumura AMatsumoto MYasuda KNoda MKaburagi Y","Department of Diabetic Complications, Diabetes Research Center, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.Department of Diabetic Complications, Diabetes Research Center, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.Section of Animal Models, Department of Infectious Diseases, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.Department of Diabetic Complications, Diabetes Research Center, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.Department of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Center Hospital, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.Department of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Center Hospital, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.Department of Complete Medical Checkup, Center Hospital, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, JR Tokyo General Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.The First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.Department of Diabetic Complications, Diabetes Research Center, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.Department of Molecular Metabolic Regulation, Diabetes Research Center, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.Department of Metabolic Disorder, Diabetes Research Center, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan.Department of Diabetic Complications, Diabetes Research Center, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20170327","Japan","J Diabetes Investig","Journal of diabetes investigation","101520702","0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)0 (Biomarkers)0 (Serpina3n protein, rat)0 (Serpins)","IM","Acute-Phase ProteinsAgedAnimalsBiomarkersDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood*Disease Models, AnimalDisease ProgressionFemaleHumansMaleMiddle AgedPrediabetic State/*blood*ProteomicsRats, Inbred StrainsRats, Long-EvansSerpins/blood","PMC5583949",NA,"NOTNLM","Long-Evans Agouti ratQuantitative serum proteomicsSerine protease inhibitor A3",NA,"2017/02/06 06:00","2018/05/09 06:00","2017/09/01","2017/02/03 06:00","2016/11/04 00:00 [received]2017/01/04 00:00 [revised]2017/01/23 00:00 [accepted]2017/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]2018/05/09 06:00 [medline]2017/02/03 06:00 [entrez]2017/09/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","JDI12638 [pii]10.1111/jdi.12638 [doi]","ppublish","J Diabetes Investig. 2017 Sep;8(5):661-671. doi: 10.1111/jdi.12638.

Endothelium-Descemet membrane complex tissues were peeled from transplant suitable donor corneas. Protein fractions were isolated from each sample and subjected to multidimensional liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Peptide spectra were matched to the human proteome, assigned gene ontology, and grouped into protein signaling pathways unique to each of the disease states. We identified an average of 12,472 unique proteins in each of the endothelium-Descemet membrane complex tissue samples. There were 2,409 differentially expressed protein isoforms that included previously known risk factors for type II diabetes mellitus related to metabolic processes, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that diabetes progression has many protein footprints related to metabolic processes, binding, and catalysis. The most represented pathways involved in diabetes progression included mitochondrial dysfunction, cell-cell junction structure, and protein synthesis regulation. This proteomic dataset identifies novel corneal endothelial cell and Descemet membrane protein expression in various stages of diabetic disease. These findings give insight into the mechanisms involved in diabetes progression relevant to the corneal endothelium and its basement membrane, prioritize new pathways for therapeutic targeting, and provide insight into potential biomarkers for determining the health of this tissue.","Skeie, Jessica MAldrich, Benjamin TGoldstein, Andrew SSchmidt, Gregory AReed, Cynthia RGreiner, Mark A","Skeie JMAldrich BTGoldstein ASSchmidt GAReed CRGreiner MAAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7170-6655","University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Iowa City, United States of America.Iowa Lions Eye Bank, Coralville, United States of America.Cornea Research Center, University of Iowa, Iowa City, United States of America.University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Iowa City, United States of America.Iowa Lions Eye Bank, Coralville, United States of America.Cornea Research Center, University of Iowa, Iowa City, United States of America.University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Iowa City, United States of America.Iowa Lions Eye Bank, Coralville, United States of America.Iowa Lions Eye Bank, Coralville, United States of America.Cornea Research Center, University of Iowa, Iowa City, United States of America.Iowa Lions Eye Bank, Coralville, United States of America.Cornea Research Center, University of Iowa, Iowa City, United States of America.University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Iowa City, United States of America.Iowa Lions Eye Bank, Coralville, United States of America.Cornea Research Center, University of Iowa, Iowa City, United States of America.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20180312","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Insulin)0 (Proteome)","IM","AgedDescemet Membrane/metabolism/*pathologyDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolism/*pathologyEndothelium, Corneal/metabolism/*pathologyHumansInsulin/*metabolismMiddle AgedProteome/analysis/*metabolismProteomics*Signal Transduction","PMC5846724",NA,NA,NA,"Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2018/03/13 06:00","2018/06/30 06:00","2018/03/12","2018/03/13 06:00","2017/10/04 00:00 [received]2018/01/22 00:00 [accepted]2018/03/13 06:00 [entrez]2018/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]2018/06/30 06:00 [medline]2018/03/12 00:00 [pmc-release]","PONE-D-17-35801 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0192287 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2018 Mar 12;13(3):e0192287. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0192287. eCollection 2018.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0192287",NA,2018

Using aptamer-based proteomics, we characterized arterial (A)-to-renal venous (V) gradients for >1,300 proteins in 22 individuals who underwent invasive sampling. Although most of the proteins that changed significantly decreased from A to V, consistent with renal clearance, several were found to increase, the most significant of which was testican-2. To assess the clinical implications of these physiologic findings, we examined proteomic data in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), an African-American cohort (n = 1,928), with replication in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), a White cohort (n = 1,621). In both populations, testican-2 had a strong, positive correlation with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In addition, higher baseline testican-2 levels were associated with a lower rate of eGFR decline in models adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, baseline eGFR, and albuminuria. Glomerular expression of testican-2 in human kidneys was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy, while single-cell RNA sequencing of human kidneys showed expression of the cognate gene, SPOCK2, exclusively in podocytes. In vitro, testican-2 increased glomerular endothelial tube formation and motility, raising the possibility that its secretion has a functional role within the glomerulus. Taken together, our findings identify testican-2 as a podocyte-derived biomarker of kidney health and prognosis.","Ngo, DebbyWen, DonghaiGao, YanKeyes, Michelle JDrury, Erika RKatz, Dan HBenson, Mark DSinha, SumitaShen, DongxiaoFarrell, Laurie APeterson, Bennet DFriedman, David JElmariah, SammyYoung, Bessie ASmith, J GustavYang, QiongVasan, Ramachandran SLarson, Martin GCorrea, AdolfoHumphreys, Benjamin DWang, Thomas JPollak, Martin RWilson, James GGerszten, Robert ERhee, Eugene P","Ngo DAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2681-3475Wen DAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2707-036XGao YKeyes MJDrury ERKatz DHAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-7237-8502Benson MDAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8977-2389Sinha SShen DFarrell LAAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5717-527XPeterson BDFriedman DJElmariah SAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8013-8733Young BASmith JGAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6285-9935Yang QAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-3658-1375Vasan RSAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-7357-5970Larson MGAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9631-1254Correa AHumphreys BDAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6420-8703Wang TJAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4063-6508Pollak MRWilson JGGerszten REAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6767-7687Rhee EPAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4804-7583","Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215.Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215.Nephrology Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114.Endocrine Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114.Jackson Heart Study, Department of Medicine, University of Mississippi, Jackson, MS 39216.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215.Division of Nephrology, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, NY 14642.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215.Division of Nephrology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215.Cardiology Division, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114.Kidney Research Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98104.Division of Nephrology, Veteran Affairs Puget Sound Healthcare, Seattle, WA 98108.Department of Cardiology, Clinical Sciences, Lund University and Skåne University Hospital, 221 84 Lund, Sweden.Department of Cardiology, Gothenburg University and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, 413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.Wallenberg Laboratory, Gothenburg University and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, 413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02118.Division of Preventive Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118.Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118.The Framingham Heart Study, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Framingham, MA 01702.Department of Biostatistics, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02118.The Framingham Heart Study, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Framingham, MA 01702.Jackson Heart Study, Department of Medicine, University of Mississippi, Jackson, MS 39216.Division of Nephrology, Washington University of St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390.Division of Nephrology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215;

It is well known that metformin acts via complex mechanisms, including multitarget and multipathway mechanisms; however, the multitargeted antidiabetic genes of metformin remain obscure. The present study aimed to perform transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of potential therapeutic target genes in the liver of metformin‑treated Sprague‑Dawley rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The type 2 diabetes rat model was established using streptozotocin. Fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, serum insulin and biological parameters were subsequently measured. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and proteins were identified in the rat livers by expression profile analysis and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). A 1.5‑fold alteration in gene expression, as determined using chip‑based expression profile analysis, and a 1.2‑fold alteration in protein expression, as determined using iTRAQ, were considered physiologically significant benchmarks, which were used to identify DEGS in metformin‑treated rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The DEGs were verified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis. Numerous hepatic genes involved in various metabolic pathways were affected by metformin; in particular, genes associated with lipid metabolism were markedly affected. Expression profile analysis and iTRAQ analysis suggested that carboxylesterase 1C subunit (Ces1C) and cholesterol 7α‑hydroxylyase (Cyp7a1) may serve as important DEGs, which were validated by qPCR and western blot analysis. Ces1C and Cyp7a1 are the main enzymes in cholesterol metabolism, yet the result of western blotting was not consistent with qPCR. The present study demonstrated that metformin may affect the expression of numerous hepatic genes involved in metabolic pathways, particularly the lipid and cholesterol metabolic pathways. Ces1C and Cyp7a1 may be considered novel therapeutic target genes in the liver, which are involved in the antidiabetic effects of metformin.","Chen, YitaoWu, YangshengYang, YuanxiaoXu, ZhiweiTong, JunfengLi, ZhemingZhou, XiaojieLi, Changyu","Chen YWu YYang YXu ZTong JLi ZZhou XLi C","College of Life Science, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310053, P.R.

METHODS: In total, 26 type 1 and 80 type 2 diabetes patients, along with 205 age and gender-matched healthy controls, were included in this study. Oxysterols were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and N,N-dimethylglycine derivatization. Correlations between oxysterols and clinical/biochemical characteristics of the diabetes patients, and factors affecting 7-Kchol and chol-triol, were also determined. RESULTS: Plasma 7-Kchol and chol-triol levels were significantly higher in type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001). Significant positive correlations were observed between oxysterol levels and levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), glucose, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, very-low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides, as well as the number of coronary risk factors. Statins, oral hypoglycemic agents, and antihypertensive agents reduced the levels of oxysterols in type 2 diabetes patients. Statin use, HbA1c levels, and the number of coronary risk factors accounted for 98.8% of the changes in 7-Kchol levels, and total cholesterol, smoking status, and the number of coronary risk factors accounted for 77.3% of the changes in chol-triol levels in type 2 diabetes patients. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma oxysterol levels in DM, and particularly type 2 DM, may yield complementary information regarding oxidative stress for the clinical follow-up of diabetes patients, especially those with coronary risk factors.","Samadi, AGurlek, ASendur, S NKarahan, SAkbiyik, FLay, I","Samadi AGurlek ASendur SNKarahan SAkbiyik FLay IAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1466-5746","Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.Department of Internal Medicine, Endocrinology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.Department of Internal Medicine, Endocrinology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey. lincilay@gmail.com.Clinical Pathology Laboratory, Hacettepe University Hospitals, 06100, Ankara, Turkey. lincilay@gmail.com.","eng","THD-201610908/Hacettepe University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit/","Journal Article","20180321","Italy","J Endocrinol Invest","Journal of endocrinological investigation","7806594","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Oxysterols)","IM","AdolescentAdultAgedBiomarkers/bloodChromatography, Liquid/methodsCross-Sectional StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*blood/diagnosisDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/diagnosisFemaleHumansMaleMass Spectrometry/methodsMiddle AgedOxidative Stress/*physiologyOxysterols/*bloodYoung Adult",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","Diabetes mellitusLC–MS/MSOxidative stressOxysterolsTandem mass spectrometry",NA,"2018/03/23 06:00","2019/03/14 06:00",NA,"2018/03/23 06:00","2018/01/08 00:00 [received]2018/03/09 00:00 [accepted]2018/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]2019/03/14 06:00 [medline]2018/03/23 06:00 [entrez]","10.1007/s40618-018-0873-5 [pii]10.1007/s40618-018-0873-5 [doi]","ppublish","J Endocrinol Invest. 2019 Jan;42(1):7-17. doi: 10.1007/s40618-018-0873-5.

Cross-omics technologies by virtue of a wide spectrum screening of plasma samples have the potential to identify biomarkers for the refinement of prognosis in addition to clinical variables. Here we utilized proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics panel assay measurements in baseline plasma samples from the multinational PROVALID study (PROspective cohort study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for VALIDation of biomarkers) of patients with incident or early chronic kidney disease (median follow-up 35 months, median baseline eGFR 84 mL/min/1.73 m(2), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 8.1 mg/g). In an accelerated case-control study, 258 individuals with a stable eGFR course (median eGFR change 0.1 mL/min/year) were compared to 223 individuals with a rapid eGFR decline (median eGFR decline -6.75 mL/min/year) using Bayesian multivariable logistic regression models to assess the discrimination of eGFR trajectories. The analysis included 402 candidate predictors and showed two protein markers (KIM-1, NTproBNP) to be relevant predictors of the eGFR trajectory with baseline eGFR being an important clinical covariate. The inclusion of metabolomic and lipidomic platforms did not improve discrimination substantially. Predictions using all available variables were statistically indistinguishable from predictions using only KIM-1 and baseline eGFR (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.63). Thus, the discrimination of eGFR trajectories in patients with incident or early diabetic kidney disease and maintained baseline eGFR was modest and the protein marker KIM-1 was the most important predictor.","Kammer, MichaelHeinzel, AndreasWillency, Jill ADuffin, Kevin LMayer, GertSimons, KaiGerl, Mathias JKlose, ChristianHeinze, GeorgReindl-Schwaighofer, RomanHu, KarinPerco, PaulEder, SusanneRosivall, LaszloMark, Patrick BJu, WenjunKretzler, MatthiasMcCarthy, Mark IHeerspink, Hiddo LWiecek, AndrzejGomez, Maria FOberbauer, Rainer","Kammer MHeinzel AWillency JADuffin KLMayer GSimons KGerl MJKlose CHeinze GReindl-Schwaighofer RHu KPerco PEder SRosivall LMark PBJu WKretzler MMcCarthy MIHeerspink HLWiecek AGomez MFOberbauer R","Department of Nephrology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Section for Clinical Biometrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.Department of Nephrology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.Department of Internal Medicine IV (Nephrology and Hypertension), Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.Lipotype GmbH, Tatzberg, Dresden, Germany.Lipotype GmbH, Tatzberg, Dresden, Germany.Lipotype GmbH, Tatzberg, Dresden, Germany.Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Section for Clinical Biometrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.Department of Nephrology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.Department of Nephrology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.Department of Internal Medicine IV (Nephrology and Hypertension), Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.Department of Internal Medicine IV (Nephrology and Hypertension), Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.International Nephrology Research and Training Centre, Institute of Pathophysiology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.Department of Nephrology, Transplantation and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.Department of Clinical Sciences in Malmö, Lund University Diabetes Centre, Lund, Sweden.Department of Nephrology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

Although it is present in foods and from the environment, endogenous formation of glyoxal occurs through metabolism of carbohydrates and oxidation of lipids and nucleic acids. Plasma concentrations of glyoxal are elevated in in diabetes mellitus patients compared to nondiabetics. The most abundant 2'-deoxyribonucleoside adducts cross-linked by glyoxal are dG-gx-dC, dG-gx-dA, and dG-gx-dG. These DNA cross-links can be mutagenic by damaging the integrity of the DNA structure. Herein, we developed a highly sensitive and specific assay for the simultaneous detection and quantification of the dG-gx-dC and dG-gx-dA cross-links based on stable isotope dilution (SID) nanoflow liquid chromatography nanospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS) under the highly selected reaction monitoring mode and using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The entire assay procedure involved addition of the stable isotope standards [(15)N(5)]dG-gx-dC and [(15)N(5)]dG-gx-dA as internal standards, enzyme hydrolysis to release the cross-links as nucleosides, enrichment by a reversed-phase solid-phase extraction column, and nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS analysis. The detection limit is 0.19 amol for dG-gx-dC and 0.89 amol for dG-gx-dA, which is 400 and 80 times more sensitive, respectively, than capillary LC-NSI/MS/MS assay of these adducts. The lower limit of quantification was 94 and 90 amol for dG-gx-dC and dG-gx-dA, respectively, which is equivalent to 0.056 and 0.065 adducts in 10(8) normal nucleotides in 50 μg of DNA. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients (n = 38), the levels of dG-gx-dC and dG-gx-dA in leukocyte DNA were 1.94 ± 1.20 and 2.10 ± 1.77 in 10(8) normal nucleotides, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in nondiabetics (n = 39: 0.83 ± 0.92 and 1.05 ± 0.99 in 10(8) normal nucleotides, respectively). Excluding the factor of smoking, an exogenous source of glyoxal, levels of these two cross-linked adducts were found to be significantly higher in nonsmoking T2DM patients than in nonsmoking control subjects. Furthermore, the levels of dG-gx-dC and dG-gx-dA correlated with HbA1c with statistical significance. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of the identification and quantification of glyoxal-derived cross-linked DNA adducts in human leukocyte DNA and their association with T2DM. This SID nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS assay is highly sensitive and specific and it requires only 50 μg of leukocyte DNA isolated from 2-3 mL of blood to accurately quantify these two cross-linked adducts simultaneously. Our assay thus provides a useful biomarker for the evaluation of glyoxal-derived DNA damage.","Chen, Hauh-Jyun CandyChang, Ya-LangTeng, Yi-ChunHsiao, Chiung-FongLin, Tsai-Shiuan","Chen HCAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-1869-4779Chang YLTeng YCHsiao CFLin TS","Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Chung Cheng University , 168 University Road, Ming-Hsiung, Chia-Yi 62102, Taiwan.Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Chung Cheng University , 168 University Road, Ming-Hsiung, Chia-Yi 62102, Taiwan.Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Chung Cheng University , 168 University Road, Ming-Hsiung, Chia-Yi 62102, Taiwan.Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Chung Cheng University , 168 University Road, Ming-Hsiung, Chia-Yi 62102, Taiwan.Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Chung Cheng University , 168 University Road, Ming-Hsiung, Chia-Yi 62102, Taiwan.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20171206","United States","Anal Chem","Analytical chemistry","0370536","0 (DNA Adducts)50NP6JJ975 (Glyoxal)","IM","Chromatography, LiquidDNA Adducts/*analysis/*chemistryDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*pathologyGlyoxal/*chemistryHumans*Indicator Dilution TechniquesLeukocytes/*chemistryMolecular StructureTandem Mass Spectrometry",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2017/11/28 06:00","2019/04/11 06:00",NA,"2017/11/28 06:00","2017/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]2019/04/11 06:00 [medline]2017/11/28 06:00 [entrez]","10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04296 [doi]","ppublish","Anal Chem. 2017 Dec 19;89(24):13082-13088. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b04296.

An increased level of plasma acylcarnitine (AC) has been proposed to indicate mitochondrial energy substrate overload, a possible mechanism leading to insulin resistance. The aim of our study was to determine fasting and postprandial plasma acetyl-carnitine (AC2:0), palmitoyl-carnitine (AC16:0), oleoyl-carnitine (AC18:1) and linoleoyl-carnitine (AC18:2) levels and their relationships with plasma nonesterified fatty acid appearance and oxidation rates and insulin sensitivity in participants with type 2 diabetes and normoglycemic offspring of 2 parents with type 2 diabetes (FH+) compared to healthy participants without family histories of type 2 diabetes (FH-). METHODS: All participants underwent 3 metabolic protocols: 1) a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp at fasting; 2) a 6-hour steady-state oral standard liquid meal and 3) an identical 6-hour steady-state meal intake study with a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. AC levels were measured by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) rates were measured by stable isotopic tracer techniques with indirect respiratory calorimetry. RESULTS: During the insulin clamp at fasting, AC16:0 was significantly higher in the group with type 2 diabetes vs. FH (p<0.05). In the postprandial state, AC2:0, AC16:0 and AC18:1 decreased significantly, but this reduction was blunted in type 2 diabetes, even during normalization of postprandial glucose levels during the insulin clamp. Fasting AC16:0 correlated with FAO (ρ=+0.604; p=0.0002); triacylglycerol (ρ=+0.427; p<0.02) and waist circumference (ρ=+0.416; p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Spillover of AC occurs in type 2 diabetes but is not fully established in FH+. AC16:0 can be a useful biomarker of excessive FAO.","Bouchouirab, Fatima-ZahraFortin, MélanieNoll, ChristopheDubé, JeanCarpentier, André C","Bouchouirab FZFortin MNoll CDubé JCarpentier AC","Division of Biochemistry, Department of Medical Biology, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Canada.Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Canada.Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Canada.Division of Biochemistry, Department of Medical Biology, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Canada.Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Centre de recherche du Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke, Université de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Canada.

Human myotubes are primary skeletal muscle cells displaying both morphological and biochemical characteristics of mature skeletal muscle and the diabetic phenotype is conserved in myotubes derived from subjects with type 2 diabetes. Several abnormalities have been identified in skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetic subjects, however, the exact molecular mechanisms leading to the diabetic phenotype has still not been found. Here we present a large-scale study in which we combine a quantitative proteomic discovery strategy using isobaric peptide tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and a label-free study with a targeted quantitative proteomic approach using selected reaction monitoring to identify, quantify, and validate changes in protein abundance among human myotubes obtained from nondiabetic lean, nondiabetic obese, and type 2 diabetic subjects, respectively. Using an optimized protein precipitation protocol, a total of 2832 unique proteins were identified and quantified using the iTRAQ strategy. Despite a clear diabetic phenotype in diabetic myotubes, the majority of the proteins identified in this study did not exhibit significant abundance changes across the patient groups. Proteins from all major pathways known to be important in type 2 diabetic subjects were well-characterized in this study. This included pathways like the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) cycle, lipid oxidation, oxidative phosphorylation, the glycolytic pathway, and glycogen metabolism from which all but two enzymes were found in the present study. None of these enzymes were found to be regulated at the level of protein expression or degradation supporting the hypothesis that these pathways are regulated at the level of post-translational modification. Twelve proteins were, however, differentially expressed among the three different groups. Thirty-six proteins were chosen for further analysis and validation using selected reaction monitoring based on the regulation identified in the iTRAQ discovery study. The abundance of adenosine deaminase was considerably down-regulated in diabetic myotubes and as the protein binds propyl dipeptidase (DPP-IV), we speculate whether the reduced binding of adenosine deaminase to DPP-IV may contribute to the diabetic phenotype in vivo by leading to a higher level of free DPP-IV to bind and inactivate the anti-diabetic hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulintropic polypeptide.","Thingholm, Tine EBak, SteffenBeck-Nielsen, HenningJensen, Ole NGaster, Michael","Thingholm TEBak SBeck-Nielsen HJensen ONGaster M","Department of Endocrinology, Odense University Hospital, 5000 Odense, Denmark.

The metabolic alterations associated with DACD were first investigated in humans, using plasma metabonomics based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis. The related pathway of each metabolite of interest was searched in database online. The network diagrams were established KEGGSOAP software package. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of metabolites. This is the first report of reliable biomarkers of DACD, which were identified using an integrated strategy. The identified biomarkers give new insights into the pathophysiological changes and molecular mechanisms of DACD. The disorders of sphingolipids metabolism, bile acids metabolism, and uric acid metabolism pathway were found in T2DM and DACD. On the other hand, differentially expressed plasma metabolites offer unique metabolic signatures for T2DM and DACD patients. These are potential biomarkers for disease monitoring and personalized medication complementary to the existing clinical modalities.","Zhang, LinLi, MengZhan, LibinLu, XiaoguangLiang, LinaSu, BenliSui, HuaGao, ZhengnanLi, YuzhongLiu, YingWu, BenhuiLiu, Qigui","Zhang LLi MZhan LLu XLiang LSu BSui HGao ZLi YLiu YWu BLiu Q","Academy of Integrative Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.Academy of Integrative Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China; Academy of Integrative Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.Department of Emergency Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Dalian University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.Academy of Integrative Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.Department of endocrinology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.Academy of Integrative Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.Department of endocrinology, Dalian Municipal Central Hospital Affillated of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.Examination Department, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.Medical Examination Center, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.Medical Examination Center, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.Public Health, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20150514","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Bile Acids and Salts)0 (Biomarkers)0 (Sphingolipids)268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)","IM","AgedArea Under CurveBile Acids and Salts/metabolismBiomarkers/bloodCase-Control StudiesChromatography, High Pressure LiquidCognition Disorders/*etiology/metabolism/pathologyDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*pathologyFemaleHumansMale*MetabolomeMiddle AgedMultivariate AnalysisPrincipal Component AnalysisROC CurveSphingolipids/metabolismTandem Mass SpectrometryUric Acid/metabolism","PMC4431856",NA,NA,NA,"Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2015/05/15 06:00","2016/02/26 06:00","2015/05/14","2015/05/15 06:00","2014/10/23 00:00 [received]2015/04/09 00:00 [accepted]2015/05/15 06:00 [entrez]2015/05/15 06:00 [pubmed]2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]2015/05/14 00:00 [pmc-release]","PONE-D-14-47693 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0126952 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2015 May 14;10(5):e0126952. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0126952. eCollection 2015.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0126952",NA,2015

Treatment aimed at slowing down the progression of DN is available but methods for early and definitive detection of DN progression are currently lacking. The 'Proteomic prediction and Renin angiotensin aldosterone system Inhibition prevention Of early diabetic nephRopathy In TYpe 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria trial' (PRIORITY) aims to evaluate the early detection of DN in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using a urinary proteome-based classifier (CKD273). METHODS: In this ancillary study of the recently initiated PRIORITY trial we aimed to validate for the first time the CKD273 classifier in a multicentre (9 different institutions providing samples from 165 T2D patients) prospective setting. In addition we also investigated the influence of sample containers, age and gender on the CKD273 classifier. RESULTS: We observed a high consistency of the CKD273 classification scores across the different centres with areas under the curves ranging from 0.95 to 1.00. The classifier was independent of age (range tested 16-89 years) and gender. Furthermore, the use of different urine storage containers did not affect the classification scores. Analysis of the distribution of the individual peptides of the classifier over the nine different centres showed that fragments of blood-derived and extracellular matrix proteins were the most consistently found. CONCLUSION: We provide for the first time validation of this urinary proteome-based classifier in a multicentre prospective setting and show the suitability of the CKD273 classifier to be used in the PRIORITY trial.","Siwy, JustynaSchanstra, Joost PArgiles, AngelBakker, Stephan J LBeige, JoachimBoucek, PetrBrand, KorbinianDelles, ChristianDuranton, FloreFernandez-Fernandez, BeatrizJankowski,

Crocin and voluntary exercise have anti-hyperglycemic effects in diabetes. In this research, we evaluated the effects of crocin and voluntary exercise alone or combined on glycemia control and heart level of VEGF-A. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Animals were divided into eight groups as: control (con), diabetes (Dia), crocin (Cro), voluntary exercise (Exe), crocin and voluntary exercise (Cro-Exe), diabetic-crocin (Dia-Cro), diabetic-voluntary exercise (Dia-Exe), diabetic-crocin-voluntary exercise (Dia-Cro-Exe). Type 2 diabetes was induced by a high-fat diet (4 weeks) and injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (i.p, 35 mg/kg). Animals received oral administration of crocin (50 mg/kg) or performed voluntary exercise alone or together for 8 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed on overnight fasted control, diabetic and treated rats after 8 weeks of treatment. Then, serum insulin and heart VEGF-A protein levels were measured. RESULTS: Crocin combined with voluntary exercise significantly decreased blood glucose levels (p < 0.001) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p < 0.001) compared to diabetic group. VEGF-A level was significantly (p < 0.01) lower in Dia group compared to control group. The combination of crocin and voluntary exercise significantly enhanced VEGF-A protein levels in Dia-Cro-Exe and Cro-Exe group compared to diabetic and control groups, respectively; p < 0.001 and p < 0.05. DISCUSSION: Crocin combined with voluntary exercise improved insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and reduced glucose levels in diabetic rats. Since both crocin and voluntary exercise can increase VEGF-A protein expression in heart tissue, they probably are able to increase angiogenesis in diabetic animals.","Ghorbanzadeh, VMohammadi, MDariushnejad, HChodari, LMohaddes, G","Ghorbanzadeh VMohammadi MDariushnejad HChodari LMohaddes G","Drug Applied Research Center of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.Drug Applied Research Center of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.Drug Applied Research Center of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.Drug Applied Research Center of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.Neuroscience Research Centre of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, 5166614766, Tabriz, Iran. gmohades@yahoo.com.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20160419","Italy","J Endocrinol Invest","Journal of endocrinological investigation","7806594","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)36-88-4 (Carotenoids)877GWI46C2 (crocin)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IM","AnimalsBiomarkers/metabolismCarotenoids/*pharmacologyCombined Modality TherapyDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental/etiology/metabolism/*therapyDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/etiology/metabolism/*therapyDiet, High-Fat/adverse effectsDisease Models, AnimalEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent AssayGlucose/administration & dosageGlucose Tolerance TestHeart/drug effects/*physiopathology*Insulin ResistanceMale*Physical Conditioning, AnimalRatsRats, WistarVascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","CrocinDiabetes type 2HOMA-IRVEGF-AVoluntary exercise",NA,"2016/04/21 06:00","2017/04/26 06:00",NA,"2016/04/21 06:00","2015/10/21 00:00 [received]2016/03/07 00:00 [accepted]2016/04/21 06:00 [entrez]2016/04/21 06:00 [pubmed]2017/04/26 06:00 [medline]","10.1007/s40618-016-0456-2 [pii]10.1007/s40618-016-0456-2 [doi]","ppublish","J Endocrinol Invest. 2016 Oct;39(10):1179-86. doi: 10.1007/s40618-016-0456-2.

There is also evidence that the disease is associated with cancer metastasis. Centrosome amplification can initiate tumorigenesis with metastasis in vivo and increase the invasiveness of cancer cells in vitro. Our previous study reported that type 2 diabetes promotes centrosome amplification via the upregulation and centrosomal translocation of Rho‑associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), which suggests that centrosome amplification is a candidate biological link between type 2 diabetes and cancer development. In the present study, functional proteomics analysis was used to further investigate the molecular pathways underlying centrosome amplification by targeting ROCK1 binding partners. High glucose, insulin and palmitic acid were used to induce centrosome amplification, and immunofluorescent staining was employed to visualize centrosomal alterations. Combined with immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry‑based proteomics analysis was used to identify ROCK1 binding proteins, and protein complex disruption was achieved by siRNA‑knockdown. In total, 1,148 ROCK1 binding proteins were identified, among which 106 proteins were exclusively associated with the treated samples, 193 were only associated with the control samples, and 849 were found in both the control and treated samples. Of the proteins with evidence of centrosomal localization, Dynactin subunit 2 (DCTN2) was confirmed to be localized to the centrosomes. Treating the cells with high glucose, insulin and palmitic acid increased the protein levels of ROCK1 and DCTN2, promoted their binding with each other, and triggered centrosome amplification. Disruption of the protein complex by knocking down ROCK1 or DCTN2 expression partially attenuated centrosome amplification, while simultaneous knockdown of both proteins completely inhibited centrosome amplification. These results suggested ROCK1‑DCTN2 binding as a signal for the regulation of centrosome homeostasis, which is key for diabetes‑associated centrosome amplification, and enriches our knowledge of centrosome biology. Therefore, the ROCK1‑DCTN2 complex may serve as a target for inhibiting centrosome amplification both in research or future therapeutic development.","Li, Yuan FeiShi, Lin JieWang, PuWang, Jia WenShi, Guang YiLee, Shao Chin","Li YFShi LJWang PWang JWShi GYLee SC","Department of Oncology, The First Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, P.R. China.Department of Oncology, The First Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030001, P.R. China.Changzhi Medical University, Changzhi, Shanxi 030001, P.R. China.Institute of Biomedical Sciences of The School of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221116, P.R. China.Institute of Biomedical Sciences of The School of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221116, P.R. China.Institute of Biomedical Sciences of The School of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221116, P.R. China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20210603","Greece","Oncol Rep","Oncology reports","9422756","0 (DCTN2 protein, human)0 (Dynactin Complex)0 (Insulin)2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)EC 2.7.11.1 (ROCK1 protein, human)EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IM","Cell Line, TumorCentrosome/*metabolismColonic Neoplasms/*metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*metabolismDynactin Complex/*metabolismGlucose/pharmacologyHCT116 CellsHumansInsulin/pharmacologyModels, BiologicalPalmitic Acid/pharmacologyProtein BindingProteomicsUp-Regulationrho-Associated Kinases/*metabolism","PMC8185503",NA,"NOTNLM","Rho‑associated protein kinase 1centrosome amplificationcolon cancer cellsdynactin subunit 2functional proteomicstype 2 diabetes","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","2021/06/04 06:00","2021/12/01 06:00","2021/06/02","2021/06/03 08:49","2021/01/17 00:00 [received]2021/05/05 00:00 [accepted]2021/06/03 08:49 [entrez]2021/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]2021/12/01 06:00 [medline]2021/06/02 00:00 [pmc-release]","151 [pii]OR-0-0-8102 [pii]10.3892/or.2021.8102 [doi]","ppublish","Oncol Rep. 2021 Jul;46(1):151. doi: 10.3892/or.2021.8102.

In addition, both weight gain and aging can lead to similar clinical outcomes such as insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis and stroke. Our objective was to examine the changes in protein expression within the subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese patients, matched for BMI, in relation to age. Mature adipocytes were isolated from liposuction samples of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue collected from both young (26.2±4.3 (mean age±SD); n=7) and old (52.2±4.7 (mean age±SD); n=7) obese individuals. Total protein extracts were then compared by two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE). Thirty differentially expressed protein spots (ANOVA test, p≤0.05; fold-change ≥1.8) were detected, of which, 15 were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. These were comprised of a total of thirteen unique protein sequences. Nine proteins were more abundant in the adipocytes isolated from old vs. young individuals. These proteins included prohibitin 1, protein disulphide isomerase A3, beta actin, profilin, aldo-ketoreductase 1 C2, alpha crystallin B and the annexins A1, A5 and A6. Four other proteins were less abundant in the adipocytes from old, obese subjects and these included keratin type 2 cytoskeletal 1, keratin type 2 cytoskeletal 10 and hemoglobins A and B. The differentially abundant proteins were investigated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to reveal their associations with known biological functions. This analysis identified signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 as the central molecule in the connectivity map and the apoptotic pathway as the pathway with the highest score. Differences in the abundances of several proteins were confirmed by immunoblotting: i.e., prohibitin 1, protein disulphide isomerase A3, beta actin, profilin and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 proteins. In conclusion, proteomic analysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue reveals differences in the abundance of proteins in adipocytes isolated from young vs. old individuals. These differentially abundant proteins are involved in the regulation of apoptosis, cellular senescence and inflammatory response. All these are common pathologic events in both obesity and aging.","Alfadda, Assim ABenabdelkamel, HichamMasood, AfshanMoustafa, AmrSallam, ReemBassas, AbdulelahDuncan, Mark","Alfadda AABenabdelkamel HMasood AMoustafa ASallam RBassas ADuncan M","Obesity Research Center, College of Medicine, King Saud University, P.O.

The Consortium aims to discover and validate biomarkers that: (1) predict the rate of glycaemic deterioration before and after type 2 diabetes onset; (2) predict the response to diabetes therapies; and (3) help stratify type 2 diabetes into clearly definable disease subclasses that can be treated more effectively than without stratification. This paper describes two new prospective cohort studies conducted as part of DIRECT. METHODS: Prediabetic participants (target sample size 2,200-2,700) and patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (target sample size ~1,000) are undergoing detailed metabolic phenotyping at baseline and 18 months and 36 months later. Abdominal, pancreatic and liver fat is assessed using MRI. Insulin secretion and action are assessed using frequently sampled OGTTs in non-diabetic participants, and frequently sampled mixed-meal tolerance tests in patients with type 2 diabetes. Biosamples include venous blood, faeces, urine and nail clippings, which, among other biochemical analyses, will be characterised at genetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic and metagenomic levels. Lifestyle is assessed using high-resolution triaxial accelerometry, 24 h diet record, and food habit questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: DIRECT will yield an unprecedented array of biomaterials and data. This resource, available through managed access to scientists within and outside the Consortium, will facilitate the development of new treatments and therapeutic strategies for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes.","Koivula, Robert WHeggie, AlisonBarnett, AnnaCederberg, HennaHansen, Tue HKoopman, Anitra DRidderstråle, MartinRutters, FemkeVestergaard, HenrikGupta, RamneekHerrgård, SannaHeymans, Martijn WPerry, Mandy HRauh, SimoneSiloaho, MarittaTeare, Harriet J AThorand, BarbaraBell, JimmyBrunak, SørenFrost, GaryJablonka, BerndMari, AndreaMcDonald, Tim JDekker, Jacqueline MHansen, TorbenHattersley, AndrewLaakso, MarkkuPedersen, OlufKoivisto, VeikkoRuetten, HartmutWalker, MarkPearson, EwanFranks, Paul W","Koivula RWHeggie ABarnett ACederberg HHansen THKoopman ADRidderstråle MRutters FVestergaard HGupta RHerrgård SHeymans MWPerry MHRauh SSiloaho MTeare HJThorand BBell JBrunak SFrost GJablonka BMari AMcDonald TJDekker JMHansen THattersley ALaakso MPedersen OKoivisto VRuetten HWalker MPearson EFranks PW","Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Genetic and Molecular Epidemiology, CRC, Skåne University Hospital Malmö, Building 91, Level 10, Jan Waldenströms gata 35, SE-205 02, Malmö, Sweden.","eng","MC_U120061305/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom","Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20140404","Germany","Diabetologia","Diabetologia","0006777","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)","IM","AdultAgedBiomarkers/*bloodBlood Glucose/drug effectsDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/drug therapyEpidemiologic StudiesFemaleHumansHypoglycemic Agents/therapeutic useMaleMiddle AgedPregnancyProspective Studies","PMC4018481",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2014/04/04 06:00","2015/01/24 06:00","2014/04/04","2014/04/04 06:00","2013/12/17 00:00 [received]2014/02/24 00:00 [accepted]2014/04/04 06:00 [entrez]2014/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]2015/01/24 06:00 [medline]2014/04/04 00:00 [pmc-release]","3216 [pii]10.1007/s00125-014-3216-x [doi]","ppublish","Diabetologia. 2014 Jun;57(6):1132-42. doi: 10.1007/s00125-014-3216-x.

However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between G0S2 and insulin resistance remain incompletely understood. Our study aimed to confirm the effect of G0S2 on insulin resistance, and determine whether the insulin resistance in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) results from G0S2 elevation. METHODS: In this study, we extracted livers from mice that consumed HFD and received tail vein injections of AD-G0S2/Ad-LacZ, and performed a proteomics analysis. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis revealed that there was a total of 125 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) (56 increased and 69 decreased proteins) among the identified 3583 proteins. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that four insulin signaling pathway-associated proteins were significantly upregulated and five insulin signaling pathway -associated proteins were significantly downregulated. CONCLUSION: These findings show that the DEPs, which were associated with insulin resistance, are generally consistent with enhanced insulin resistance in G0S2 overexpression mice. Collectively, this study demonstrates that G0S2 may be a potential target gene for the treatment of obesity, NAFLD, and diabetes.","Wu, DongmingZhang, ZhenyuanSun, WenxiuYan, YongJing, MengzheMa, Shizhan","Wu DZhang ZSun WYan YJing MMa S","College of First Clinical Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, China.Department of Endocrinology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, China.Shandong Clinical Research Center of Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, Jinan, China.Shandong Key Laboratory of Endocrinology and Lipid Metabolism, Jinan, China.Shandong Prevention and Control Engineering Laboratory of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Jinan, China.Department of Nursing, Taishan Vocational College of Nursing, Taian, China.Department of Transfusion Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, China.Department of Endocrinology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, China.Shandong Clinical Research Center of Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, Jinan, China.Shandong Key Laboratory of Endocrinology and Lipid Metabolism, Jinan, China.Shandong Prevention and Control Engineering Laboratory of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Jinan, China.Department of Endocrinology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, China.Shandong Clinical Research Center of Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases, Jinan, China.Shandong Key Laboratory of Endocrinology and Lipid Metabolism, Jinan, China.Shandong Prevention and Control Engineering Laboratory of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, Jinan, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20230323","Switzerland","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Frontiers in endocrinology","101555782","0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)0 (Insulin)0 (G0S2 protein, mouse)","IM","AnimalsMiceCell Cycle Proteins/geneticsDiet, High-Fat/adverse effectsInsulin*Insulin Resistance/genetics*Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/metabolismObesity/complicationsProteomics","PMC10076770",NA,"NOTNLM","G0S2high-fat dietinsulin sensitivitylabel-free proteomicsmetabolic diseases","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","2023/04/11 06:00","2023/04/11 06:42","2023/01/01","2023/04/10 03:51","2022/12/23 00:00 [received]2023/03/07 00:00 [accepted]2023/04/11 06:42 [medline]2023/04/10 03:51 [entrez]2023/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]2023/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.3389/fendo.2023.1130350 [doi]","epublish","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2023 Mar 23;14:1130350. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2023.1130350. eCollection 2023.","Copyright © 2023 Wu, Zhang, Sun, Yan, Jing and Ma.",NA,NA,"10.3389/fendo.2023.1130350",NA,2023

Hyperglycemia results in a state of oxidative stress, which may contribute to the production of insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction and long-term complications of diabetes. Novel approaches are required for prevention and treatment of diabetes. New biomarkers that can be used in risk stratification and therapy control as supplementary to current parameters are needed. These biomarkers may facilitate a more individualized and sufficient treatment of diabetes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the levels of oxidatively induced DNA damage products, 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) (also known as 8-OH-dG), (5'R) and (5'S)-8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosines (R-cdA and S-cdA), and the lipid peroxidation product 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2α) (8-iso-PGF(2α)) as reliable oxidative stress markers in patients with prediabetes or T2DM in comparison with healthy volunteers. Urine samples were collected from these subjects. Absolute quantification of 8-oxo-dG, R-cdA, S-cdA and 8-iso-PGF(2α) was achieved by liquid chromatography-isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry. The levels of 8-oxo-dG, S-cdA and 8-iso-PGF(2α) were significantly greater in prediabetes patients than those in healthy volunteers. T2DM patients also had higher levels of 8-oxo-dG than healthy volunteers. No statistically significant difference was observed for R-cdA levels. 8-Oxo-dG levels positively correlated with R-cdA and S-cdA levels for prediabetes and newly diagnosed T2DM. S-cdA levels and HbA1c were found negatively correlated in prediabetes patients. Also 8-iso-PGF(2α) levels and HbA1c were found negatively correlated in prediabetes patients. These results indicate that oxidatively induced macromolecular damage appears before the establishment of T2DM. Thus, our data suggest that oxidatively induced DNA damage and lipid peroxidation products that were found to be elevated in prediabetic stage may be used as early disease markers in patients at risk for T2DM.","Kant, MelisAkış, MerveÇalan, MehmetArkan, TuğbaBayraktar, FıratDizdaroglu, Miralİşlekel, Hüray","Kant MAkış MÇalan MArkan TBayraktar FDizdaroglu Mİşlekel H","Department of Medical Biochemistry, Institute of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, 35340, Izmir, Turkey.

Type-2 diabetes mellitus without diabetic retinopathy (XDR) was designated as control. METHOD: In this study, 45 saliva samples were collected (15 samples from XDR control group, 15 samples from NPDR disease group and 15 samples from PDR disease group). Salivary proteins were extracted, reduced, alkylated, trypsin digested and labeled with an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) before being analyzed by an Orbitrap fusion tribrid mass spectrometer. Protein annotation, fold change calculation and statistical analysis were interrogated by Proteome Discoverer. Biological pathway analysis was performed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD003723-PX003725. RESULTS: A total of 315 proteins were identified from the salivary proteome and 119 proteins were found to be differentially expressed. The differentially expressed proteins from the NPDR disease group and the PDR disease group were assigned to respective canonical pathways indicating increased Liver X receptor/Retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) activation, Farnesoid X receptor/Retinoid X receptor (FXR/RXR) activation, acute phase response signaling, sucrose degradation V and regulation of actin-based motility by Rho in the PDR disease group compared to the NPDR disease group. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Progression from non-proliferative to proliferative retinopathy in type-2 diabetic patients is a complex multi-mechanism and systemic process. Furthermore, saliva was shown to be a feasible alternative sample source for diabetic retinopathy biomarkers.","Chee, Chin SoonChang, Khai MengLoke, Mun FaiAngela Loo, Voon PeiSubrayan, Visvaraja","Chee CSChang KMLoke MFAngela Loo VPSubrayan V","Department of Ophthalmology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Department of Ophthalmology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Department of Medical Microbiology/Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Department of Ophthalmology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Department of Ophthalmology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20160512","United States","PeerJ","PeerJ","101603425",NA,NA,NA,"PMC4893325",NA,"NOTNLM","Diabetic retinopathyLC-MSSalivary proteomeiTRAQ","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","2016/06/10 06:00","2016/06/10 06:01","2016/05/12","2016/06/10 06:00","2015/12/17 00:00 [received]2016/04/13 00:00 [accepted]2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]2016/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]2016/06/10 06:01 [medline]2016/05/12 00:00 [pmc-release]","2022 [pii]10.7717/peerj.2022 [doi]","epublish","PeerJ. 2016 May 12;4:e2022. doi: 10.7717/peerj.2022. eCollection 2016.",NA,NA,NA,"10.7717/peerj.2022",NA,2016

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is an alternative therapy to delay the development of macrovascular diseases, but the existing evidence of its efficacy, safety and mechanism of action is insufficient. We report a study protocol of a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that aims to use well-designed clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) Shen-Qi Hua-Yu formula, and to explore efficacy mechanism of the TCM granules and the biomarkers of TCM syndrome. METHODS: This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled study that randomized 120 participants into 2 groups. The treatment group will receive TCM granules and conventional medicine, while the control group will receive placebo in addition to conventional medicine. Two groups will receive 12-week treatment and 48-week follow-up, with a total of 13 visits. Primary efficacy outcomes included ankle brachial index. Secondary efficacy outcomes included fasting plasma glucose, blood lipid, hemorheology indexes, advanced glycation end products, the inner diameter, peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity and mean average velocity of the anterior tibial artery, posterior tibial artery and dorsalis pedis artery, and TCM syndrome score. The safety and endpoint outcomes will be evaluated in this trial. The study will explain the biological therapeutic mechanism of Shen-Qi Hua-Yu formula for diabetic LEAD, and try to use Isobaric tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) and Western blot to screen biomarkers of characteristic diagnosis and clinical efficiency evaluation of the TCM syndrome. DISCUSSION: This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHM in patients with diabetic LEAD, and to interpret the therapeutic mechanism of Shen-Qi Hua-Yu formula in treatment of diabetic LEAD through proteomics technology, and to screen biomarkers with characteristics of TCM diagnosis and clinical efficacy evaluation. On the other hand, to our knowledge, this study may be the first trial of CHM formulas to observe cardiovascular outcomes through long-term follow-up for the treatment of diabetic LEAD, which is of great value.

Here, we investigated the applicability of an (18)O-labeling technique for the development of a standard-free, label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Rather than attempting to identify quantitative differences in proteins as biomarkers, glycation of the highest abundance protein in human plasma, human serum albumin (HSA), was monitored through quantitative analysis of HSA characteristic peptides using the (18)O-labeling technique. Eight glucose-sensitive peptides and one glucose-insensitive peptide were discovered.

Many previous studies demonstrated that omental adipose tissue dysfunction could induce insulin resistance. Thus, to investigate the cause of insulin resistance in GDM, we used label-free proteomics to identify differentially expressed proteins in omental adipose tissues from GDM and NGT subjects (data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD003095). A total of 3528 proteins were identified, including 66 significantly changed proteins. Adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (APMAP, a.k.a. C20orf3), one of the differentially expressed proteins, was down-regulated in GDM omental adipose tissues. Furthermore, mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used to simulate omental adipocytes. The inhibition of APMAP expression by RNAi impaired insulin signaling and activated NFκB signaling in these adipocytes. Our study revealed that the down-regulation of APMAP in omental adipose tissue may play an important role in insulin resistance in the pathophysiology of GDM.","Ma, YuhangGao, JingYin, JiajingGu, LipingLiu, XingChen, SuHuang, QianfangLu, HuifangYang, YueminZhou, HuWang, YufanPeng, Yongde","Ma YGao JYin JGu LLiu XChen SHuang QLu HYang YZhou HWang YPeng Y","Department of Analytical Chemistry and CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.Department of Analytical Chemistry and CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.Department of Analytical Chemistry and CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences , 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20160127","United States","J Proteome Res","Journal of proteome research","101128775","0 (Membrane Proteins)0 (NF-kappa B)0 (Proteome)","IM","3T3-L1 CellsAdipocytes/*metabolismAdipose Tissue/*metabolism/physiopathologyAdultAnimalsBlotting, WesternChromatography, LiquidDiabetes, Gestational/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathologyFemaleHumansInsulin Resistance/genetics/physiologyMembrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolismMiceNF-kappa B/metabolismOmentum/metabolismPregnancyProteome/genetics/*metabolismProteomics/*methodsRNA InterferenceSignal TransductionTandem Mass Spectrometry",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","gestational diabetes mellitusinflammationinsulin resistancelabel-free proteomic analysis",NA,"2016/01/16 06:00","2016/11/15 06:00",NA,"2016/01/16 06:00","2016/01/16 06:00 [entrez]2016/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]2016/11/15 06:00 [medline]","10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b01030 [doi]","ppublish","J Proteome Res. 2016 Feb 5;15(2):628-37. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b01030.

Here, twenty-nine protein glycation sites were quantified after tryptic digestion of plasma samples at the peptide level using tandem mass spectrometry and isotope-labelled peptides as internal standard. The glycation degrees were determined in three groups, i.e., 48 patients with a duration of T2DM exceeding ten years, 48 non-diabetic individuals matched for gender, BMI, and age, and 20 prediabetic men. In long-term controlled diabetic patients, 27 glycated peptides were detected at significantly higher levels, providing moderate diagnostic accuracies (ACCs) from 61 to 79%, allowing a subgrouping of patients in three distinct clusters. Moreover, a feature set of one glycated peptides and six established clinical parameters provided an ACC of 95%. The same number of clusters was identified in prediabetic males (ACC of 95%) using a set of eight glycation sites (mostly from serum albumin). All patients present in one cluster showed progression of prediabetic state or advanced towards diabetes in the following five years. Overall, the studied glycation sites appear to be promising biomarkers for subgrouping prediabetic patients to estimate their risk for the development of T2DM.","Spiller, SandroLi, YichaoBlüher, MatthiasWelch, LonnieHoffmann, Ralf","Spiller SLi YAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5791-096XBlüher MWelch LAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5791-096XHoffmann R","Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy and Center for Biotechnology Biomedicine, Universität Leipzig, Deutscher Platz 5, 04103 Leipzig, Germany. sandro.spiller@uni-leipzig.de.School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Ohio University, Stocker Center 354, Athens 45701, OH, USA. yl079811@ohio.edu.Department of Medicine, Endocrinology and Nephrology, Universität Leipzig, Liebigstr. 21, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.

METHODS: In this study, we used data from non-targeted metabolomics performed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in three Swedish cohorts (Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men [ULSAM], n = 1138; Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors [PIVUS], n = 970; TwinGene, n = 1630). Metabolites associated with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or prevalent type 2 diabetes were assessed for associations with incident type 2 diabetes in the three cohorts followed by replication attempts in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) S4 cohort (n = 855). Assessment of the association of metabolite-regulating genetic variants with type 2 diabetes was done using data from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies. RESULTS: Out of 5961 investigated metabolic features, 1120 were associated with prevalent type 2 diabetes and IFG and 70 were annotated to metabolites and replicated in the three cohorts. Fifteen metabolites were associated with incident type 2 diabetes in the four cohorts combined (358 events) following adjustment for age, sex, BMI, waist circumference and fasting glucose. Novel findings included associations of higher values of the bile acid deoxycholic acid and monoacylglyceride 18:2 and lower concentrations of cortisol with type 2 diabetes risk. However, adding metabolites to an existing risk score improved model fit only marginally. A genetic variant within the CYP7A1 locus, encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, was found to be associated with lower concentrations of deoxycholic acid, higher concentrations of LDL-cholesterol and lower type 2 diabetes risk. Variants in or near SGPP1, GCKR and FADS1/2 were associated with diabetes-associated phospholipids and type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We found evidence that the metabolism of bile acids and phospholipids shares some common genetic origin with type 2 diabetes.

Metabolic diseases such as obesity and type II diabetes mellitus as well as associated conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia lead to elevated levels of circulating estrogens. Increased estrogen concentrations, in turn, further trigger the proliferation of endometrial cells and thus promote EC development and progression, especially in the absence of progesterone as seen in postmenopausal women. Elevated blood glucose levels in diabetic patients further contribute to the risk of EC development. Metformin is an insulin-sensitizing biguanide drug, commonly used in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus, especially in obese patients. Besides its effects on glucose metabolism, metformin displayed anti-cancer effects in various cancer types, including EC. Direct anti-cancer effects of metformin target signaling pathways that are involved in cellular growth and proliferation, e.g. the AKT/PKB/mTOR pathway. Further proteins and pathways have been suggested as potential targets, but the underlying mechanism of action of metformin's anti-cancer activity is still not completely understood. In the present study, the effects of metformin on protein expression were investigated in the human EC cell line HEC-1A using an affinity proteomic approach. Cells were treated with 0.5 mmol/L metformin over a period of 7 days and changes in the expression pattern of 1,300 different proteins were compared to the expression in untreated control cells as well as insulin-treated cells. Insulin treatment (100 ng/mL) was incorporated into the study in order to implement a model for insulin resistance and associated hyperinsulinemia, conditions that are often observed in obese and diabetic patients. Furthermore, the culture medium was supplemented with 10 nmol/L ß-estradiol (E2) during treatments to mimic increased estrogen levels, a common risk factor for EC development. Based on the most prominent and significant changes in expression, a set of 80 proteins was selected and subjected to a more detailed analysis. The data revealed that metformin and insulin targeted similar pathways in the present study and mostly acted on proteins related to proliferation, migration and tumor immune response. These pathways may be affected in a tumor-promoting as well as a tumor-suppressing way by either metformin treatment or insulin supplementation. The consequences for the cells resulting from the detected expression changes were discussed in detail for several proteins. The presented data helps identify potential targets affected by metformin treatment in EC and allows for a better understanding of the mechanism of action of the biguanide drug's anti-cancer activity. However, further investigations are necessary to confirm the observations and conclusions drawn from the presented data after metformin administration, especially for proteins that were regulated in a favorable way, i.e. AKT3, CCND2, CD63, CD81, GFAP, IL5, IL17A, IRF4, PI3, and VTCN1. Further proteins might be of interest, where metformin counteracted unfavorable effects that have been induced by hyperinsulinemia.","Lange, CarstenMachado Weber, AmandaSchmidt, RonnySchroeder, ChristophStrowitzki, ThomasGermeyer, Ariane","Lange CAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4915-0870Machado Weber ASchmidt RSchroeder CAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6177-1042Strowitzki TGermeyer A","Department of Gynecologic Endocrinology and Fertility Disorders, Women's Hospital, Ruprecht-Karls University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.Department of Gynecologic Endocrinology and Fertility Disorders, Women's Hospital, Ruprecht-Karls University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.Sciomics GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany.Sciomics GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany.Department of Gynecologic Endocrinology and Fertility Disorders, Women's Hospital, Ruprecht-Karls University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.Department of Gynecologic Endocrinology and Fertility Disorders, Women's Hospital, Ruprecht-Karls University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20210309","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Antineoplastic Agents)0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)0 (Insulin)0 (Proteins)9100L32L2N (Metformin)","IM","Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacologyCell Line, TumorEndometrial Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolismFemaleHumansHyperinsulinism/*drug therapy/metabolismHypoglycemic Agents/*pharmacologyInsulin/metabolismMetformin/*pharmacologyProteins/analysis/metabolismProteomicsSignal Transduction/*drug effects","PMC7943011",NA,NA,NA,"The authors have read the journal’s policy and have the following competing interests to declare: R.S. is a paid employee of Sciomics GmbH, C.S. is founder and shareholder of Sciomics GmbH.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the total serum vitamin D response to vitamin D3 supplementation and whether it varies according to participant characteristics. To compare results with corresponding results for total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], which is used clinically and measured in supplementation trials. DESIGN: Exploratory study within a randomized trial. INTERVENTION: 2000 International Units of vitamin D3 per day (or matching placebo). SETTING: Community-based. PARTICIPANTS: 161 adults (mean ± SD age 70 ± 6 years; 66% males) with type 2 diabetes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in total serum vitamin D and total serum 25(OH)D concentrations from baseline to year 2. RESULTS: At baseline, there was a positive, nonlinear relation between total serum vitamin D and total serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Adjusted effects of supplementation were a 29.2 (95% CI: 24.3, 34.1) nmol/L increase in serum vitamin D and a 33.4 (95% CI: 27.7, 39.2) nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH)D. Among those with baseline 25(OH)D < 50 compared with ≥ 50 nmol/L, the serum vitamin D response to supplementation was attenuated (15.7 vs 31.2 nmol/L; interaction P-value = 0.02), whereas the serum 25(OH)D response was augmented (47.9 vs 30.7 nmol/L; interaction P-value = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D3 supplementation increases total serum vitamin D and 25(OH)D concentrations with variation according to baseline 25(OH)D, which suggests that 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 is more efficient when serum 25(OH)D concentration is low.","Best, Cora MZelnick, Leila RThummel, Kenneth EHsu, SimonLimonte, ChristineThadhani, RaviSesso, Howard DManson, JoAnn EBuring, Julie EMora, SamiaLee, I-MinCook, Nancy RFriedenberg, GeorginaLuttmann-Gibson, Heikede Boer, Ian HHoofnagle, Andrew N","Best CMAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8400-9288Zelnick LRThummel KEHsu SAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3780-294XLimonte CThadhani RSesso HDManson JEBuring JEMora SAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6283-0980Lee IMCook NRFriedenberg GLuttmann-Gibson Hde Boer IHHoofnagle ANAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6449-0243","Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.Kidney Research Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.Kidney Research Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.Department of Pharmaceutics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.Kidney Research Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.Kidney Research Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.Mass General Brigham, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T.H.

In this study, we profiled carbonylated proteins in plasma samples obtained from lean individuals and obese patients with or without T2DM. The plasma samples were digested with trypsin, carbonyl groups were derivatized with O-(biotinylcarbazoylmethyl)hydroxylamine, enriched by avidin affinity chromatography, and analyzed by RPC-MS/MS. Signals of potentially modified peptides were targeted in a second LC-MS/MS analysis to retrieve the peptide sequence and the modified residues. A total of 158 unique carbonylated proteins were identified, of which 52 were detected in plasma samples of all three groups. Interestingly, 36 carbonylated proteins were detected only in obese patients with T2DM, whereas 18 were detected in both nondiabetic groups. The carbonylated proteins originated mostly from liver, plasma, platelet, and endothelium. Functionally, they were mainly involved in cell adhesion, signaling, angiogenesis, and cytoskeletal remodeling. Among the identified carbonylated proteins were several candidates, such as VEGFR-2, MMP-1, argin, MKK4, and compliment C5, already connected before to diabetes, obesity and metabolic diseases.","Bollineni, Ravi ChandFedorova, MariaBlüher, MatthiasHoffmann, Ralf","Bollineni RCFedorova MBlüher MHoffmann R","Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy, ‡Center for Biotechnology and Biomedicine, and §Department of Medicine, Universität Leipzig , Deutscher Platz 5, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20140710","United States","J Proteome Res","Journal of proteome research","101128775","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Proteins)EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K4 protein, human)EC 3.4.24.7 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 1)","IM","AdultBiomarkers/*blood/metabolismBlood Proteins/*analysis/*metabolismCase-Control StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/etiologyFemaleHumansIdeal Body WeightMAP Kinase Kinase 4/blood/metabolismMaleMatrix Metalloproteinase 1/blood/metabolismMiddle AgedObesity/*blood/complicationsProtein CarbonylationProteomics/methodsVascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/blood/metabolismWorkflow",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","LC−MS/MSaldehyde reactive probe (ARP)obesityprotein carbonylationtype 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)",NA,"2014/07/11 06:00","2015/10/16 06:00",NA,"2014/07/11 06:00","2014/07/11 06:00 [entrez]2014/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]","10.1021/pr500324y [doi]","ppublish","J Proteome Res. 2014 Nov 7;13(11):5081-93. doi: 10.1021/pr500324y.

Effect of high dose thiamine has also been observed on the levels of these marker proteins. Above 100 type 2 diabetic patients, and 50 same age and sex-matched normal healthy controls were recruited from the Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan and 40 diabetic and 20 control have completed the trial. The urine samples from control and diabetic groups before or after thiamine therapy were further analyzed and identified by 2-D liquid chromatographic system (HPLC) and mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF/TOF and microTOF analysis. All the samples belonging to the control and diabetic groups were then analyzed by ELISA and estimated the levels of some proteins which were found to vary. In the urine samples, the levels of transthyretin, AMBP, haptoglobin precursor were found to decrease while albumin, zinc α 2 glycoprotein, RBP4 and E cadherin were found to increase in the diabetic patients as compared to the controls. The level of albumin in the urine samples of diabetic patients only decreased by 34% after thiamine therapy as compared to the controls and the placebo, while other urinary protein markers did not show a significant change after the therapy. Assessment of the levels of these biomarkers will be helpful in the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2.","Riaz, SamreenSkinner, VernonSrai, Surjit Kaila","Riaz SSkinner VSrai SK","School of Biological Sciences, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. samreen@biochem.ucl.ac.uk","eng",NA,"Controlled Clinical TrialJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20101113","England","J Pharm Biomed Anal","Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis","8309336","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Proteins)X66NSO3N35 (Thiamine)","IMEIN  J Pharm Biomed Anal. 2011 Aug 25;56(1):139","AdultAgedAlbuminuria/drug therapyBiomarkers/urineChromatography, High Pressure LiquidDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complicationsDiabetic Nephropathies/*drug therapy/*urineFemaleHumansMaleMiddle AgedPakistanPatient DropoutsProteins/chemistryProteinuria/*drug therapyProteomics/*methodsSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-IonizationTandem Mass SpectrometryThiamine/*administration & dosage",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2010/12/07 06:00","2011/04/19 06:00",NA,"2010/12/07 06:00","2010/08/12 00:00 [received]2010/10/27 00:00 [revised]2010/11/07 00:00 [accepted]2010/12/07 06:00 [entrez]2010/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]2011/04/19 06:00 [medline]","S0731-7085(10)00651-5 [pii]10.1016/j.jpba.2010.11.008 [doi]","ppublish","J Pharm Biomed Anal. 2011 Mar 25;54(4):817-25. doi: 10.1016/j.jpba.2010.11.008.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that plasma sphingolipid profiles predict incident prediabetes. DESIGN: A case-control study nested in the Pathobiology of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort study, a 5-year follow-up study. SETTING: Academic health center. PARTICIPANTS: Normoglycemic adults enrolled in the Pathobiology of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort study. Assessments included oral glucose tolerance test, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion. Participants with incident prediabetes were matched in age, sex, and ethnicity with nonprogressors. INTERVENTIONS: We assayed 58 sphingolipid species (ceramides, monohexosyl ceramides, sphingomyelins, and sphingosine) using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry in baseline plasma levels from participants and determined association with prediabetes risk. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome was progression from normoglycemia to prediabetes, defined as impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. RESULTS: The mean age of participants (N = 140; 50% Black, 50% female) was 48.1 ± 8.69 years, body mass index 30.1 ± 5.78 kg/m2, fasting plasma glucose 92.7 ± 5.84 mg/dL, and 2-hour plasma glucose 121 ± 23.3 mg/dL. Of the 58 sphingolipid species assayed, higher ratios of sphingomyelin C26:0/C26:1 (OR, 2.73 [95% CI, 1.172-4.408], P = .015) and ceramide C18:0/C18:1 (OR, 1.236 [95% CI, 1.042-1.466], P = .015) in baseline plasma specimens were significantly associated with progression to prediabetes during the 5-year follow-up period, after adjustments for age, race, sex, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the saturated-to-monounsaturated ratios of long-chain ceramide C18:0/C18:1 and very-long-chain sphingomyelin C26:0/C26:1 are potential biomarkers of prediabetes risk among individuals with parental history of type 2 diabetes.","Dagogo-Jack, SamuelAsuzu, PeaceWan, JimGrambergs, RichardStentz, FrankieMandal, Nawajes","Dagogo-Jack SAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5318-9677Asuzu PWan JGrambergs RStentz FMandal NAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4489-7748","Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.General Clinical Research Center, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.Departments of Ophthalmology, Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.Memphis VA Medical Center, Memphis, TN 38104, USA.","eng","R01 DK067269/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR01 R01DK067269/National Institute of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases/","Journal Article",NA,"United States","J Clin Endocrinol Metab","The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism","0375362","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Ceramides)0 (Sphingolipids)","IMCIN  J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2025 Jan 21;110(2):e540-e541. doi: 10.1210/clinem/dgae274.

We studied whether a urine proteome specific for sight-threatening proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is an indicator to predict chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) in patients with T2D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A shotgun urine proteomic analysis was performed in patients with MAU and PDR (case subjects) and in patients with MAU and a duration of T2D for >10 years but without any degree of retinopathy (control subjects). In the cohort study, 210 patients with T2D with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥80 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were followed for a median of 5.3 years. Urine proteins specific for PDR were used for predicting CRI (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). RESULTS: The top two urine proteins with the highest difference in ratio of case subjects to control subjects were haptoglobin (8.7 times; P < 0.0001) and α-2-macroglobulin (5.7 times; P < 0.0001). In the cohort study, patients with baseline urinary haptoglobin ≥20 ng/min (haptoglobinuria) had a higher incidence of CRI than those without (hazard ratio [95% CI] 3.27 [1.41-7.58]; P = 0.006). The overall CRI rate was 3.2% for patients without haptoglobinuria or MAU, 9.5% for those with MAU, and 13.3% for those with haptoglobinuria. The highest rate for CRI (22.4%) was in patients with both MAU and haptoglobinuria (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Urine haptoglobin, which is specific for PDR, is a novel biomarker and complement to urine albumin for predicting kidney damage in patients with T2D.","Yang, Jin-KuiWang, Ying-YingLiu, ChangShi, Ting-TingLu, JingCao, XiYang, Fang-YuanFeng, Jian-PingChen, ChenJi, Li-NongXu, Aimin","Yang JKAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7008-9229Wang YYLiu CShi TTLu JCao XYang FYFeng JPChen CJi LNXu A","Beijing Key Laboratory of Diabetes Research and Care, Department of Endocrinology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China jkyang@ccmu.edu.cn.Beijing Key Laboratory of Diabetes Research and Care, Department of Endocrinology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Diabetes Research and Care, Department of Endocrinology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Diabetes Research and Care, Department of Endocrinology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Diabetes Research and Care, Department of Endocrinology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Diabetes Research and Care, Department of Endocrinology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Diabetes Research and Care, Department of Endocrinology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Diabetes Research and Care, Department of Endocrinology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.Endocrinology and Metabolism Department, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China.State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Department of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20161130","United States","Diabetes Care","Diabetes care","7805975","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Haptoglobins)0 (Proteome)","IM","AgedAlbuminuria/urineBiomarkers/urineCase-Control StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*urineDiabetic Retinopathy/complications/*urineFemaleFollow-Up StudiesGlomerular Filtration RateHaptoglobins/urineHumansIncidenceMaleMiddle AgedProspective StudiesProteome/*metabolismProteomicsRenal Insufficiency, Chronic/complications/*epidemiology/*urine",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2016/12/03 06:00","2017/11/29 06:00",NA,"2016/12/02 06:00","2016/07/15 00:00 [received]2016/11/16 00:00 [accepted]2016/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]2016/12/02 06:00 [entrez]","dc16-1529 [pii]10.2337/dc16-1529 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes Care. 2017 Feb;40(2):253-260. doi: 10.2337/dc16-1529.

The pathophysiology of T2D is presumed to occur with an alteration in the levels of plasma proteins. To identify these differentially expressed proteins, plasma samples from normal and T2D humans were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, quantitative densitometry, and mass spectrometry. Up to 200 protein spots were visible on each gel, of which 57 appeared modulated in diabetic individuals. Subsequently, 31 spots with > or =2-fold change in their expression were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry leading to the identification of 11 proteins with average sequence coverage of approximately 38%. The expression of apolipoprotein A-I was reduced by 4.2-fold, and galectin-1 was increased 4.8 times in diabetic samples. Induction of galectin-1 in T2D samples was confirmed by ELISA. In addition, the dose-dependent treatment of rat L6 skeletal muscle cells with glucose resulted in an upregulation of galectin-1. These data implicate the association of galectin-1 with the pathophysiology of diabetes and identify galectin-1 as a novel diagnostic marker protein in T2D patients.","Liu, XiaojunFeng, QipingChen, YongZuo, JinGupta, NishithChang, YongshengFang, Fude","Liu XFeng QChen YZuo JGupta NChang YFang F","National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100005, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"United States","J Proteome Res","Journal of proteome research","101128775","0 (Blood Proteins)0 (Galectin 1)0 (Proteome)","IM","AdultAgedAmino Acid SequenceBlood Proteins/*analysisDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*metabolismElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-DimensionalFemaleGalectin 1/*metabolismHumansMaleMiddle AgedMolecular Sequence DataProteome/*metabolismSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2009/01/08 09:00","2009/07/11 09:00",NA,"2009/01/08 09:00","2009/01/08 09:00 [entrez]2009/01/08 09:00 [pubmed]2009/07/11 09:00 [medline]","10.1021/pr800850a [doi]","ppublish","J Proteome Res. 2009 Mar;8(3):1255-62. doi: 10.1021/pr800850a.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1021/pr800850a",NA,2009

However, the link between insulin resistance and beta-cell failure in T2D is not fully understood. To explore this association, we studied transgenic MKR mice that initially develop insulin resistance in skeletal muscle but by 8 weeks of age have T2D. In the present study, global islet protein and gene expression changes were characterized in diabetic MKR versus non-diabetic control mice at 10 weeks of age. Using a quantitative proteomics approach (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)), 159 proteins were differentially expressed in MKR compared with control islets. Marked up-regulation of protein biosynthesis and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways and parallel down-regulation in insulin processing/secretion, energy utilization, and metabolism were observed. A fraction of the differentially expressed proteins identified (including GLUT2, DNAJC3, VAMP2, RAB3A, and PC1/3) were linked previously to insulin-secretory defects and T2D. However, many proteins for the first time were associated with islet dysfunction, including the unfolded protein response proteins (ERP72, ERP44, ERP29, PPIB, FKBP2, FKBP11, and DNAJB11), endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation proteins (VCP and UFM1), and multiple proteins associated with mitochondrial energy metabolism (NDUFA9, UQCRH, COX2, COX4I1, COX5A, ATP6V1B2, ATP6V1H, ANT1, ANT2, ETFA, and ETFB). The mRNA expression level corresponding to these proteins was examined by microarray, and then a small subset was validated using quantitative real time PCR and Western blot analyses. Importantly approximately 54% of differentially expressed proteins in MKR islets (including proteins involved in proinsulin processing, protein biosynthesis, and mitochondrial oxidation) showed changes in the proteome but not transcriptome, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation. These results underscore the importance of integrated mRNA and protein expression measurements and validate the use of the iTRAQ method combined with microarray to assess global protein and gene changes involved in the development of T2D.","Lu, HongfangYang, YingAllister, Emma MWijesekara, NadeejaWheeler, Michael B","Lu HYang YAllister EMWijesekara NWheeler MB","Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto M5S 1A8, Canada.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20080430","United States","Mol Cell Proteomics","Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP","101125647","0 (Proteome)0 (RNA, Messenger)","IM","AnimalsBlotting, WesternDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*metabolismGene Expression ProfilingIn Vitro TechniquesInsulin-Secreting Cells/metabolismIslets of Langerhans/*chemistry/metabolismMaleMiceMice, TransgenicProteome/*analysisProteomicsRNA, Messenger/metabolism","PMC2500228",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2008/05/02 09:00","2008/09/10 09:00","2009/08/01","2008/05/02 09:00","2008/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]2008/09/10 09:00 [medline]2008/05/02 09:00 [entrez]2009/08/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","S1535-9476(20)31311-6 [pii]M700478-MCP200 [pii]10.1074/mcp.M700478-MCP200 [doi]","ppublish","Mol Cell Proteomics. 2008 Aug;7(8):1434-51. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M700478-MCP200.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the main active constituents and the pharmacological mechanism of Pinctada martensii flesh enzymatic hydrolysate (PMH) against T2DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The hypoglycemic activity of enzymolysis peptides from Pinctada martensii was evaluated by using db/db mice, through the influence of glycemic index, blood lipid and key protein expression of PI3K-Akt pathway. In addition, label-free quantitative proteomics was used to screen the key proteins for Pinctada martensii hydrolysate (PMH) to improve T2DM, and Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to verify the expression difference of differential proteins at protein and mRNA levels between different groups. RESULTS: PMH were prepared and characterized. In vivo investigations revealed that the PMH could regulate blood glucose and improve glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance, reduced serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in db/db mice. Western blot results showed that PMH could up-regulate IRS-1, P-PI3K/PI3K and P-Akt/Akt levels in db/db mice. Label-free quantitative proteomic approach was used to analyze the proteome in db/db mouse liver, 231 proteins were reversed significantly (p < 0.05), and these proteins were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and other pathways. Further screened 15 proteins with FC > 1.2 could be enriched in the retinol metabolic pathway, and the proteins in this pathway were also verified. CONCLUSIONS: PMH has hypoglycemic effect and can be used as a potential natural T2DM intervener. The hypoglycemic activity of PMH is related to its regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The PI3K/AKT pathway and the retinol pathway are considered as another potential pathway for PMH to exert hypoglycemic effects.","Li, JiayunWei, YuanqingHuang, SiyingYan, ShenghanZhao, BinyuanWang, XinzhiSun, JipengChen, TianbaoLai, YueyangLiu, Rui","Li JWei YHuang SYan SZhao BWang XSun JChen TLai YLiu R","Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Research and Development in Marine Bio-resource Pharmaceutics, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, PR China; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, PR China; School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, PR China.Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Research and Development in Marine Bio-resource Pharmaceutics, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, PR China; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, PR China; School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, PR China.Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Research and Development in Marine Bio-resource Pharmaceutics, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, PR China; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, PR China; School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, PR China.Zhejiang Haifu Marine Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Zhoushan, 202450, PR China.Zhejiang Haifu Marine Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Zhoushan, 202450, PR China.Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, PR China; School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, PR China.Zhejiang Marine Development Research Institute, Zhoushan, 316021, PR China.Animal-Derived Chinese Medicine and Functional Peptides International Collaboration Joint Laboratory, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, PR China; Natural Drug Discovery Group, School of Pharmacy, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, BT9 7BL, UK.Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine Prevention and Treatment of Tumor, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic administration of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), a water-soluble dietary fiber, on the occurrence of diabetes and its complications, fatty liver and nephropathy. We also identified predictive serum biomarkers of treatment response to PHGG by mass spectroscopy-based proteomic analysis using Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a good model of human non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In this study, at 5 weeks of age, OLETF rats and control strain Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats were fed a control diet or a high-fiber diet (5% PHGG) for 57 weeks. Body weight, food intake, oral glucose tolerance test, plasma insulin levels, and urine glucose and protein levels were regularly measured. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and storage of serum in a deep freezer were conducted at the beginning of the experiment and every 4 weeks after overnight fasting during the experiments. PHGG treatment affected neither meal patterns nor the body weight of OLETF and LETO rats. Repeated measure analysis of variance revealed significant differences in fasting plasma glucose and plasma glucose at 2 h after OGTT between control OLETF (OLETF-C) rats and OLETF rats treated with PHGG (OLETF-F). The glucose response determined by the area under the curve of OGTT was significantly greater in OLETF-C rats than that in OLETF-F rats at 25 weeks of age. HOMA-IR, an index of insulin resistance, increased at 25 weeks of age in OLETF-C rats, while this increase was significantly inhibited in OLETF-F rats. At 62 weeks of age, PHGG treatment significantly improved hepatic steatosis as well as renal mesangial matrix accumulation in OLETF rats. To identify the risk marker for diabetes mellitus by SELDI-TOF MS, we collected sera from 21-week-old individuals. Among the 12 specific peaks that were risk marker candidates for diabetes mellitus, the m/z 13,720 peak was identified as that of cysteinylated transthyretin by sequencing of four tryptic peptides using tandem mass spectrometry and peak distribution around the m/z 13,720 peak in the SELDI-TOF spectra. In conclusion, we found that chronic treatment with PHGG improved insulin resistance, delayed the onset of diabetes, and inhibited the development of diabetic complications, as well as identified cysteinylated transthyretin as a predictive biomarker of treatment response to PHGG in OLETF rats.","Naito, YujiIchikawa, HiroshiAkagiri, SatomiUchiyama, KazuhikoTakagi, TomohisaHanda, OsamuYasukawa, ZentaTokunaga, MakotoIshihara, NoriyukiOkubo, TsutomuMukai, JunOhki, MakotoUchida, KagehiroYoshikawa, Toshikazu","Naito YIchikawa HAkagiri SUchiyama KTakagi THanda OYasukawa ZTokunaga MIshihara NOkubo TMukai JOhki MUchida KYoshikawa T","Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto 602-8566, Japan.Department of Medical Life Systems, Faculty of Life and Medical Sciences, Doshisha University, 1-3 Tatara Miyakodani, Kyotanabe-shi, Kyoto 610-0321, Japan.Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto 602-8566, Japan.Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto 602-8566, Japan.Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto 602-8566, Japan.Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto 602-8566, Japan.Nutrition Division, Taiyo Kagaku Co., Ltd., 1-3 Takaramachi, Yokkaichi, Mie 510-0844, Japan.Nutrition Division, Taiyo Kagaku Co., Ltd., 1-3 Takaramachi, Yokkaichi, Mie 510-0844, Japan.Nutrition Division, Taiyo Kagaku Co., Ltd., 1-3 Takaramachi, Yokkaichi, Mie 510-0844, Japan.Nutrition Division, Taiyo Kagaku Co., Ltd., 1-3 Takaramachi, Yokkaichi, Mie 510-0844, Japan.Biomarker Science Co., Ltd., 103-5 Tanaka-Monzencho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 540-0029, Japan.Biomarker Science Co., Ltd., 103-5 Tanaka-Monzencho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 540-0029, Japan.Biomarker Science Co., Ltd., 103-5 Tanaka-Monzencho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 540-0029, Japan.Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465 Kajii-cho, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto 602-8566, Japan.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20151208","Japan","J Clin Biochem Nutr","Journal of clinical biochemistry and nutrition","8700907",NA,NA,NA,"PMC4706097",NA,"NOTNLM","biomarkercysteinylationdiabetes mellitusdietary fibertransthyretin",NA,"2016/01/23 06:00","2016/01/23 06:01","2016/01/01","2016/01/23 06:00","2015/08/14 00:00 [received]2015/08/27 00:00 [accepted]2016/01/23 06:00 [entrez]2016/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]2016/01/23 06:01 [medline]2016/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","jcbn15-98 [pii]10.3164/jcbn.15-98 [doi]","ppublish","J Clin Biochem Nutr. 2016 Jan;58(1):23-33. doi: 10.3164/jcbn.15-98.

We employed an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach to analyze the proteomic changes in the sera collected from a pair of 4-week-old KK-A(y) versus C57BL/6 mice. Among the 227 proteins identified, a total of 45 proteins were differentially expressed in KK-A(y) versus C57BL/6 mice. We comparatively analyzed a series of the sera collected at 4 and 12weeks of age from KK-A(y) and C57BL/6 mice for the target protein using multiple reaction monitoring analysis, and identified 8 differentially expressed proteins between the sera of these mice at both time points. Among them, serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 3K (SERPINA3K) levels were elevated significantly in the sera of KK-A(y) mice compared to C57BL/6 mice. An in vitro assay revealed that the human homologue SERPINA3 increased the transendothelial permeability of retinal microvascular endothelial cells, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes and/or diabetic retinopathy. With the identified proteins, our proteomics study could provide valuable clues for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with T2DM. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In this paper, we investigated the serum proteome of KK-A(y) mice in a pre-diabetic state compared to that of wild type controls in an attempt to uncover early diagnostic markers of diabetes that are maintained through a diabetic phenotype. We used iTRAQ-based two-dimensional LC-MS/MS serum profiling, and identified several differentially expressed proteins at the pre-diabetic stage. The differential expression was confirmed by multiple reaction monitoring assay, which is fast gaining ground as a sensitive, specific, and cost-effective methodology for relative quantification of the candidate proteins. Using these techniques, we have identified eight candidate proteins of interest including SERPINA3K, which may be important in the pathology of T2DM and/or diabetic retinopathy.","Takahashi, EriOkumura, AkinoriUnoki-Kubota, HiroyukiHirano, HisashiKasuga, MasatoKaburagi, Yasushi","Takahashi EOkumura AUnoki-Kubota HHirano HKasuga MKaburagi Y","Department of Diabetic Complications, Diabetes Research Center, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20130329","Netherlands","J Proteomics","Journal of proteomics","101475056","0 (Blood Proteins)0 (Proteome)","IM","AnimalsBlood Proteins/*metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*blood/genetics/pathologyDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/genetics/pathologyDiabetic Retinopathy/blood/genetics/pathologyGene Expression RegulationHumansMiceMice, Mutant StrainsProteome/*metabolismProteomics/*methods",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013/04/03 06:00","2014/01/01 06:00",NA,"2013/04/03 06:00","2012/10/24 00:00 [received]2013/03/15 00:00 [revised]2013/03/19 00:00 [accepted]2013/04/03 06:00 [entrez]2013/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]","S1874-3919(13)00161-9 [pii]10.1016/j.jprot.2013.03.014 [doi]","ppublish","J Proteomics. 2013 Jun 12;84:40-51. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2013.03.014.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify proteomic markers of the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and their association with type 2 diabetes risk. METHODS: We examined the associations between the AHEI and DASH diet quality scores and 1317 plasma proteins in African American participants of the Jackson Heart Study (JHS, n = 1878). These findings were validated in a Singapore Multi-Ethnic Cohort (n = 2395) and examined in relation to type 2 diabetes incidence (n = 539 cases). We adjusted for multiple testing by using false discovery rate-adjusted q values. RESULTS: We identified 13 proteins consistently associated with the AHEI or DASH scores with the strongest associations for the AHEI score and epidermal growth factor receptor (β:0.089; SE: 0.017; q < 0.001) and for the DASH score and tissue factor (β: -0.114; SE: 0.022; q < 0.001). Most of these proteins were related to inflammation, thrombosis, adipogenesis, and glucose metabolism. Concentrations of myeloperoxidase, epidermal growth factor receptor, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, coagulation factor Xa, contactin 4, kynureninase, neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1, and vesicular integral-membrane protein VIP36 were associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes in the Asian cohort. The diabetes odds ratio for a 2-fold higher protein abundance concentration ranged from 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.08) for neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 to 3.04 (95% CI: 2.13, 4.33) for kynureninase. Furthermore, genetic markers for myeloperoxidase and hepatocyte growth factor receptor were significantly associated with diabetes risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our study across geographically and ethnically diverse populations identified robust protein biomarkers for healthy dietary patterns.

Proteins, products of gene transcription, serve as dynamic biomarkers for pinpointing perturbed pathways in disease development. Previous T2D proteomic association studies primarily focused on European populations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between plasma proteins and the incidence of T2D in Asian participants. METHODS: We examined the association of 4,775 plasma proteins with incident T2D in a Singapore multi-ethnic cohort of 1,659 Asian participants (539 cases and 1,120 controls) using logistic regression. We used two-sample Mendelian randomization and colocalization analysis to evaluate the causal relationship between proteins and T2D. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed 522 proteins that were associated with incident T2D after adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity, and 17 proteins that remained significantly associated after adjusting for other T2D risk factors such as fasting glucose, waist circumference, and triglycerides. Among the 522 proteins associated with incident T2D, the change in 205 plasma proteins, observed in parallel with the development of T2D at baseline and six-years follow-up, were further associated with incident T2D. The associated proteins showed enrichment in neuron generation, glycosaminoglycan binding, and insulin-like growth factor binding. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis suggested three plasma proteins, GSTA1, INHBC, and FGL1, play causal roles in the development of T2D, with colocalization evidence supporting GSTA1 and INHBC. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal plasma protein profiles linked to the onset of T2D in Asian populations, offering insights into the biological mechanisms of T2D development.","Liang, YujianLim, Charlie G YRitchie, Scott CBertin, NicolasChai, Jin-FangYao, JialiLi, YunTai, E Shyongvan Dam, Rob MSim, Xueling","Liang YLim CGYAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6709-8722Ritchie SCBertin NChai JFYao JLi YAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9275-4189Tai ESAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2929-8966van Dam RMAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7354-8734Sim XAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1233-7642","Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.Cambridge Baker Systems Genomics Initiative, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.Victor Phillip Dahdaleh Heart and Lung Research Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.Health Data Research UK Cambridge, Wellcome Genome Campus and University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.British Heart Foundation Cardiovascular Epidemiology Unit, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A∗STAR), Singapore, Singapore.Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.Departments of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences and Epidemiology, Milken Institute School of Public Health, The George Washington University, Washington, District of Colombia, USA.Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore and National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20250122","United States","J Clin Endocrinol Metab","The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism","0375362",NA,"IM",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","ColocalizationIncident casesLongitudinal studyMendelian randomizationProteomicsType 2 diabetes",NA,"2025/01/23 05:16","2025/01/23 05:16",NA,"2025/01/22 20:53","2024/08/23 00:00 [received]2024/12/13 00:00 [revised]2025/01/22 00:00 [accepted]2025/01/23 05:16 [medline]2025/01/23 05:16 [pubmed]2025/01/22 20:53 [entrez]","7972780 [pii]10.1210/clinem/dgaf045 [doi]","aheadofprint","J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2025 Jan 22:dgaf045. doi: 10.1210/clinem/dgaf045.","© The Author(s) 2025.

This study attempted to identify potential biomarkers by detecting changes in the levels of plasma proteins in T2DM patients following onset of AMI in comparison with those without AMI. Volunteer T2DM patients without AMI (control; n=10) and T2DM patients with AMI (n=10) were recruited. Plasma samples from these patients were evaluated via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) to screen for proteins with level changes between the two groups. The abundance of spots on gel images was analyzed using Progenesis SameSpots and subjected to false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. Protein spots with statistically significant changes of at least 1.5 fold were selected for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Due to strong cardiac connections, tetranectin and titin were evaluated by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The adjusted P-values and fold changes between the two groups resulted in identification of 34 protein spots with significantly altered abundance. Upon MS analysis, 17 plasma proteins were identified: tetranectin, titin, clusterin, haptoglobin, myosin-13, zinc fnger protein 445, DNA repair protein RAD50, serum albumin, apolipoprotein A-IV, caspase-6, aminoacyl tRNA synthase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1, serotransferrin, retinol-binding protein 4, transthyretin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein A-I and serum amyloid A. Comparable patterns of changes in tetranectin and titin between the control and AMI groups were confirmed using ELISA. In summary, tetranectin and titin in plasma appeared to be closely associated with the onset of AMI among T2DM patients and can be used as potential biomarkers for prediction of a cardiac event, though this requires validation in a prospective cohort study.","Rahim, Mohd Aizat AbdulRahim, Zubaidah Haji AbdulAhmad, Wan Azman WanBakri, Marina MohdIsmail, Muhammad DzafirHashim, Onn Haji","Rahim MAARahim ZHAAhmad WAWBakri MMIsmail MDHashim OH","Centre of Preclinical Science Studies, Faculty of Dentistry, Universiti Teknologi MARA, 47000 Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia.Department of Oral and Craniofacial Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 50603.Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 50603.Department of Oral and Craniofacial Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 50603.Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 50603.Department of Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 50603. onnhashim@um.edu.my.University of Malaya Centre for Proteomics Research, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 50603. onnhashim@um.edu.my.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20180208","United States","Acta Pharmacol Sin","Acta pharmacologica Sinica","100956087","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Connectin)0 (Lectins, C-Type)0 (TTN protein, human)109489-77-2 (tetranectin)","IM","Acute DiseaseBiomarkers/bloodConnectin/*bloodDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*bloodElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-DimensionalFemaleHumansLectins, C-Type/*bloodMaleMiddle AgedMyocardial Infarction/*blood/diagnosisSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization","PMC6289394",NA,"NOTNLM","2D gel electrophoresisacute myocardial infarctioncoronary diseasediabetes mellitusenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayproteomicstetranectintitin",NA,"2018/02/09 06:00","2018/10/30 06:00","2019/07/01","2018/02/09 06:00","2017/08/07 00:00 [received]2017/10/10 00:00 [accepted]2018/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]2018/10/30 06:00 [medline]2018/02/09 06:00 [entrez]2019/07/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1038/aps.2017.141 [pii]90 [pii]10.1038/aps.2017.141 [doi]","ppublish","Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2018 Jul;39(7):1197-1207. doi: 10.1038/aps.2017.141.

Clinical trials aiming for earlier prevention of diabetic nephropathy by renin angiotensin system blocking treatment in normoalbumuric patients have given mixed results. This might reflect that the large fraction of normoalbuminuric patients are not at risk of progression, thereby reducing power in previous studies. A specific risk classifier based on urinary proteomics (chronic kidney disease (CKD)273) has been shown to identify normoalbuminuric diabetic patients who later progressed to overt kidney disease, and may hold the potential for selection of high-risk patients for early intervention. Combining the ability of CKD273 to identify patients at highest risk of progression with prescription of preventive aldosterone blockade only to this high-risk population will increase power. We aim to confirm performance of CKD273 in a prospective multicentre clinical trial and test the ability of spironolactone to delay progression of early diabetic nephropathy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Investigator-initiated, prospective multicentre clinical trial, with randomised double-masked placebo-controlled intervention and a prospective observational study. We aim to include 3280 type 2 diabetic participants with normoalbuminuria. The CKD273 classifier will be assessed in all participants. Participants with high-risk pattern are randomised to treatment with spironolactone 25 mg once daily, or placebo, whereas, those with low-risk pattern will be observed without intervention other than standard of care. Treatment or observational period is 3 years.The primary endpoint is development of confirmed microalbuminuria in 2 of 3 first morning voids urine samples. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be conducted under International Conference on Harmonisation  Good clinical practice (ICH-GCP) requirements, ethical principles of Declaration of Helsinki and national laws. This first new biomarker-directed intervention trial aiming at primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy may pave the way for personalised medicine approaches in treatment of diabetes complications.

Lipidomics enables the assessment of hundreds of lipid species as potential markers for disease risk. METHODS: Plasma lipid species (310) were measured by a targeted lipidomic analysis with liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry on a case-cohort (n=3779) subset from the ADVANCE trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron-MR Controlled Evaluation). The case-cohort was 61% male with a mean age of 67 years. All participants had type 2 diabetes mellitus with ≥1 additional cardiovascular risk factors, and 35% had a history of macrovascular disease. Weighted Cox regression was used to identify lipid species associated with future cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death) and cardiovascular death during a 5-year follow-up period. Multivariable models combining traditional risk factors with lipid species were optimized with the Akaike information criteria. C statistics and NRIs were calculated within a 5-fold cross-validation framework. RESULTS: Sphingolipids, phospholipids (including lyso and ether species), cholesteryl esters, and glycerolipids were associated with future cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. The addition of 7 lipid species to a base model (14 traditional risk factors and medications) to predict cardiovascular events increased the C statistic from 0.680 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.678-0.682) to 0.700 (95% CI, 0.698-0.702; P<0.0001) with a corresponding continuous NRI of 0.227 (95% CI, 0.219-0.235). The prediction of cardiovascular death was improved with the incorporation of 4 lipid species into the base model, showing an increase in the C statistic from 0.740 (95% CI, 0.738-0.742) to 0.760 (95% CI, 0.757-0.762; P<0.0001) and a continuous net reclassification index of 0.328 (95% CI, 0.317-0.339). The results were validated in a subcohort with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=511) from the LIPID trial (Long-Term Intervention With Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease). CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in the prediction of cardiovascular events, above traditional risk factors, demonstrates the potential of plasma lipid species as biomarkers for cardiovascular risk stratification in diabetes mellitus.

While extensive research has been conducted on adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for promoting wound healing, there is a scarcity of studies focusing on diabetic wounds, particularly those employing proteomics and bioinformatics approaches. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which ADSCs promote diabetic wound healing using proteomics and bioinformatics techniques. METHODS: Healthy rat fat tissue was used to isolate ADSCs. A T2DM rat model with back wounds was established. The experimental group received ADSC injections around the wound, while the control group received PBS injections. Wound healing rates were documented and photographed on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14. On day 7, wound tissues were excised for HE and Masson's staining. Additionally, on day 7, tissues were analyzed for protein quantification using 4D-DIA, with subsequent GO and KEGG analyses for differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using STRING database (String v11.5). Finally, Western blot experiments were performed on day 7 wounds to verify target proteins. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In all measured days postoperatively, the wound healing rate was significantly higher in the ADSC group than in the PBS group (day 7: p < 0.001, day 10: p = 0.001, day 14: p < 0.01), except on day 3 (p > 0.05). Proteomic analysis identified 474 differentially expressed proteins, with 224 key proteins after PPI analysis (78 upregulated and 146 downregulated in the ADSC group). The main cellular locations of these proteins were ""cellular anatomical entity"" and ""protein-containing complex"", while the biological processes were ""cellular processes"" and ""biological regulation"". The primary molecular functions were ""binding"" and ""catalytic activity"", with GO enrichment focused on ""Wnt-protein binding"", ""neural development"", and ""collagen-containing extracellular matrix"". Further analysis of PPI network nodes using LASSO regression identified Thy1 and Wls proteins, significantly upregulated in the ADSC group, as potentially crucial targets for ADSC application in diabetic wound treatment.","Gu, YuanMu, ZelanChen, YuanzhengWu, CanShi, JieBai, Nan","Gu YMu ZChen YWu CShi JBai N","School of Clinical Medicine, Shandong Second Medical University, Weifang, China.School of Clinical Medicine, Shandong Second Medical University, Weifang, China.Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery, Emergency General Hospital, Beijing, China.Medical Cosmetic Plastic Surgery, Linyi People's Hospital, Linyi, China.Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery, People's Hospital of Liaoning Province, Shenyang, China.Medical Cosmetic Plastic Surgery, Linyi People's Hospital, Linyi, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240913","Switzerland","Front Cell Dev Biol","Frontiers in cell and developmental biology","101630250",NA,NA,NA,"PMC11427884",NA,"NOTNLM","ADSCsbioinformaticschronic woundsdiabetic woundsproteomics","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","2024/09/30 12:45","2024/09/30 12:46","2024/01/01","2024/09/30 09:35","2024/07/21 00:00 [received]2024/08/26 00:00 [accepted]2024/09/30 12:46 [medline]2024/09/30 12:45 [pubmed]2024/09/30 09:35 [entrez]2024/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","1468220 [pii]10.3389/fcell.2024.1468220 [doi]","epublish","Front Cell Dev Biol. 2024 Sep 13;12:1468220. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2024.1468220. eCollection 2024.","Copyright © 2024 Gu, Mu, Chen, Wu, Shi and Bai.",NA,NA,"10.3389/fcell.2024.1468220",NA,2024

Dysregulation of O-GlcNAcylation may be involved in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it is necessary to identify cellular proteins that are induced by elevated O-GlcNAcylation. Here, using adenosine 5'-triphosphate affinity chromatography, we employed a proteomic approach in order to identify differentially expressed proteins in response to treatment with the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor, O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc), in mouse C2C12 myotube cells. Among 205 selected genes, we identified 68 nucleotide-binding proteins, 14 proteins that have adenosinetriphosphatase activity, and 10 proteins with ligase activity. Upregulation of proteins, including ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, proteasome subunit 20S, cullin-associated NEDD8-dissociated protein 1, ezrin, and downregulation of the protein nucleoside diphosphate kinase B, were confirmed by western blot analysis. In particular, we found that the protein ubiquitination level in C2C12 cells was increased by PUGNAc treatment. This is the first report of quantitative proteomic profiles of myotube cells after treatment with PUGNAc, and our results demonstrate the potential to enhance understanding of the relationship between insulin resistance, O-GlcNAc, and PUGNAc in the future.","Park, Ja-HyeLee, Jeong-EunMoon, Pyong-GonBaek, Moon-Chang","Park JHLee JEMoon PGBaek MC","Department of Molecular Medicine, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.Cell and Matrix Research Institute, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.Department of Molecular Medicine, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.Cell and Matrix Research Institute, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.Department of Molecular Medicine, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.Cell and Matrix Research Institute, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.Department of Molecular Medicine, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.Cell and Matrix Research Institute, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20151104","England","Cell Biochem Funct","Cell biochemistry and function","8305874","0 (Glucosides)0 (Oximes)0 (Phenylcarbamates)0 (Proteome)0 (Ubiquitin)132489-69-1 (N-acetylglucosaminono-1,5-lactone O-(phenylcarbamoyl)oxime)8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)V956696549 (Acetylglucosamine)","IM","Acetylglucosamine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacologyAdenosine Triphosphate/metabolismAnimalsBlotting, WesternCell LineGlucosides/metabolismMiceMolecular Sequence AnnotationMuscle Fibers, Skeletal/drug effects/*metabolismOximes/*pharmacologyPhenylcarbamates/*pharmacologyProtein Binding/drug effectsProteome/metabolismProteomicsStaining and LabelingUbiquitin/metabolismUbiquitination/*drug effects",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","ATP-affinity chromatographyC2C12 myotube cellO-GlcNAcPUGNAcproteomicsubiquitination",NA,"2015/11/05 06:00","2016/10/25 06:00",NA,"2015/11/05 06:00","2015/04/27 00:00 [received]2015/09/24 00:00 [revised]2015/09/29 00:00 [accepted]2015/11/05 06:00 [entrez]2015/11/05 06:00 [pubmed]2016/10/25 06:00 [medline]","10.1002/cbf.3150 [doi]","ppublish","Cell Biochem Funct. 2015 Dec;33(8):525-33. doi: 10.1002/cbf.3150.

Here, leveraging data from 42,062 participants across 2,920 plasma proteins in the UK Biobank, we characterized the proteomic signatures of social isolation and loneliness through proteome-wide association study and protein co-expression network analysis. Proteins linked to these constructs were implicated in inflammation, antiviral responses and complement systems. More than half of these proteins were prospectively linked to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and mortality during a 14 year follow-up. Moreover, Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis suggested causal relationships from loneliness to five proteins, with two proteins (ADM and ASGR1) further supported by colocalization. These MR-identified proteins (GFRA1, ADM, FABP4, TNFRSF10A and ASGR1) exhibited broad associations with other blood biomarkers, as well as volumes in brain regions involved in interoception and emotional and social processes. Finally, the MR-identified proteins partly mediated the relationship between loneliness and cardiovascular diseases, stroke and mortality. The exploration of the peripheral physiology through which social relationships influence morbidity and mortality is timely and has potential implications for public health.","Shen, ChunZhang, RuohanYu, JintaiSahakian, Barbara JCheng, WeiFeng, Jianfeng","Shen CZhang RYu JAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2532-383XSahakian BJAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-7352-1745Cheng WAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-1118-1743Feng JAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8890-8288","Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.Key Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience and Brain-Inspired Intelligence (Fudan University), Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China.Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK.Department of Neurology and National Center for Neurological Disorders, Huashan Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology and MOE Frontiers Center for Brain Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. bjs1001@cam.ac.uk.Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. bjs1001@cam.ac.uk.Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. bjs1001@cam.ac.uk.Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. wcheng@fudan.edu.cn.Key Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience and Brain-Inspired Intelligence (Fudan University), Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China. wcheng@fudan.edu.cn.Department of Neurology and National Center for Neurological Disorders, Huashan Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology and MOE Frontiers Center for Brain Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. wcheng@fudan.edu.cn.Institute of Science and Technology for Brain-Inspired Intelligence, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. jffeng@fudan.edu.cn.Key Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience and Brain-Inspired Intelligence (Fudan University), Ministry of Education, Shanghai, China. jffeng@fudan.edu.cn.Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK. jffeng@fudan.edu.cn.Zhangjiang Fudan International Innovation Center, Shanghai, China. jffeng@fudan.edu.cn.School of Data Science, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. jffeng@fudan.edu.cn.","eng","2018SHZDZX01/Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission)/82101617/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)/82071997/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)/2022M710765/China Postdoctoral Science Foundation/","Journal Article","20250103","England","Nat Hum Behav","Nature human behaviour","101697750",NA,"IM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Competing interests: The authors declare no competing interests.","2025/01/04 00:20","2025/01/04 00:20",NA,"2025/01/03 23:39","2024/01/17 00:00 [received]2024/10/31 00:00 [accepted]2025/01/04 00:20 [medline]2025/01/04 00:20 [pubmed]2025/01/03 23:39 [entrez]","10.1038/s41562-024-02078-1 [pii]10.1038/s41562-024-02078-1 [doi]","aheadofprint","Nat Hum Behav. 2025 Jan 3. doi: 10.1038/s41562-024-02078-1.","© 2025.

Dietary flavonoids have been recommended to prevent brain damage. Astragalus membranaceus is a herbal medicine commonly used to relieve the complications of diabetes. Flavonoids is one of the major ingredients of Astragalus membranaceus, but its function and mechanism on diabetic encepholopathy is still unknown. METHODS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model was induced by high fat diet and STZ in C57BL/6J mice, and BEnd.3 and HT22 cell lines were applied in the in vitro study. Quality of flavonoids was evaluated by LC-MS/MS. Differential expressed proteins in the hippocampus were evaluated by proteomics; influence of the flavonoids on composition of gut microbiota was analyzed by metagenomics. Mechanism of the flavonoids on diabetic encepholopathy was analyzed by Q-PCR, Western Blot, and multi-immunological methods et al. RESULTS: We found that flavonoids from Astragalus membranaceus (TFA) significantly ameliorated brain damage by modulating gut-microbiota-brain axis: TFA oral administration decreased fasting blood glucose and food intake, repaired blood brain barrier, protected hippocampus synaptic function; improved hippocampus mitochondrial biosynthesis and energy metabolism; and enriched the intestinal microbiome in high fat diet/STZ-induced diabetic mice. In the in vitro study, we found TFA increased viability of HT22 cells and preserved gut barrier integrity in CaCO(2) monocellular layer, and PGC1α/AMPK pathway participated in this process. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that flavonoids from Astragalus membranaceus ameliorated brain impairment, and its modulation on gut-brain axis plays a pivotal role. Our present study provided an alternative solution on preventing and treating diabetic cognition impairment.","Li, XulingZhao, TingtingGu, JunlingWang, ZheLin, JingWang, RushangDuan, TingtingLi, ZhenghaiDong, RuixueWang, WeimingHong, Kin-FongLiu, ZhilongHuang, WenboGui, DingkunZhou, HuaXu, Youhua","Li XZhao TGu JWang ZLin JWang RDuan TLi ZDong RWang WHong KFLiu ZHuang WGui DZhou HXu YAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-3258-013X","Faculty of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, People's Republic of China.Faculty of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, People's Republic of China.Faculty of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, People's Republic of China.Faculty of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, People's Republic of China.Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine-Zhuhai Hospital, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China.Institute of Consun Co. for Chinese Medicine in Kidney Diseases, Guangdong Consun Pharmaceutical Group, Dongpeng Road 71, Guangzhou, China.Institute of Consun Co. for Chinese Medicine in Kidney Diseases, Guangdong Consun Pharmaceutical Group, Dongpeng Road 71, Guangzhou, China.Institute of Consun Co. for Chinese Medicine in Kidney Diseases, Guangdong Consun Pharmaceutical Group, Dongpeng Road 71, Guangzhou, China.School of Pharmacy, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, People's Republic of China.Faculty of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, People's Republic of China.Faculty of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, People's Republic of China.Department of Endocrinology, Zhuhai Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Zhuhai, People's Republic of China.Faculty of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, People's Republic of China.Department of Nephrology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated to Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. dick7837@163.com.Faculty of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, People's Republic of China. hzhou@must.edu.mo.School of Pharmacy, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, People's Republic of China. hzhou@must.edu.mo.Department of Endocrinology, Zhuhai Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Zhuhai, People's Republic of China. hzhou@must.edu.mo.Faculty of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, People's Republic of China. yhxu@must.edu.mo.School of Pharmacy, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, People's Republic of China. yhxu@must.edu.mo.Department of Endocrinology, Zhuhai Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Zhuhai, People's Republic of China. yhxu@must.edu.mo.Zhuhai MUST Science and Technology Research Institute, Hengqin, Zhuhai, People's Republic of China. yhxu@must.edu.mo.","eng","0006/2019/A/the Science and Technology Development Fund of Macau/0055/2019/AMJ/the Science and Technology Development Fund of Macau/0025/2019/AGJ/the Science and Technology Development Fund of Macau/","Journal Article","20220212","England","Chin Med","Chinese medicine","101265109",NA,NA,NA,"PMC8840557",NA,"NOTNLM","Astragalus membranaceusBrainDiabetesGutMicrobiota","All authors declare that they have no potential conflict of interest.","2022/02/14 06:00","2022/02/14 06:01","2022/02/12","2022/02/13 20:24","2021/11/30 00:00 [received]2022/01/28 00:00 [accepted]2022/02/13 20:24 [entrez]2022/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]2022/02/14 06:01 [medline]2022/02/12 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1186/s13020-022-00578-8 [pii]578 [pii]10.1186/s13020-022-00578-8 [doi]","epublish","Chin Med. 2022 Feb 12;17(1):22. doi: 10.1186/s13020-022-00578-8.","© 2022.

We previously reported that plasma levels of N(ε)-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) were decreased in obese subjects resulting from CML accumulation in adipose tissue and that this CML accumulation plays an important role in adipose tissue inflammation. The objective of this study is to investigate associations between obesity (body mass index, waist circumference, and trunk fat mass), plasma CML (as an inversely correlated marker of CML accumulation in adipose tissue), and low-grade inflammation (LGI) in a large sample of individuals whose weight status ranged from normal to morbid obesity. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We studied 1270 individuals of the Cohort on Diabetes and Atherosclerosis Maastricht Study and Hoorn Study, in whom protein-bound CML levels were measured by UPLC-Tandem MS (ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry), and 6 inflammatory markers were measured with multiarrays. These inflammatory markers were compiled into an LGI score. Multiple linear regression, adjusted for covariates, showed that (1) waist circumference was inversely associated with protein-bound CML plasma levels (standardized regression coefficient [β]=-0.357 [95% confidence interval: -0.414; -0.301]); (2) protein-bound CML was inversely associated with LGI score (β=-0.073 [-0.130;-0.015]); and (3) the association between waist circumference and LGI (β=0.262 [0.203;0.321]) was attenuated after adjustment for protein-bound CML plasma levels and other potential mediators (to β=0.202 [0.138;0.266]), with CML explaining the greatest portion of the attenuation (≈12%). Further analysis with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measures of body composition confirmed a strong inverse association of fat mass preferentially accumulated in the trunk with protein-bound CML plasma levels, significantly explaining ≈21% of the trunk fat-LGI association. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity, in particular central obesity, is characterized by greater levels of LGI but by lower levels of circulating CML; the latter significantly explaining a portion of the positive association between central obesity and inflammation.","Gaens, Katrien H JFerreira, Isabelvan de Waarenburg, Marjo P Hvan Greevenbroek, Marleen Mvan der Kallen, Carla J HDekker, Jacqueline MNijpels, GielRensen, Sander SStehouwer, Coen D ASchalkwijk, Casper G","Gaens KHFerreira Ivan de Waarenburg MPvan Greevenbroek MMvan der Kallen CJDekker JMNijpels GRensen SSStehouwer CDSchalkwijk CG","From the Department of Internal Medicine (K.H.J.G., M.P.H.v.d.W., M.M.v.G., C.J.H.v.d.K., C.D.A.S., C.G.S.), CARIM School for Cardiovascular Diseases (K.H.J.G., I.F., M.P.H.v.d.W., M.M.v.G., C.J.H.v.d.K., C.D.A.S., C.G.S.), Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Medical Technology Assessment (KEMTA) (I.F.), Department of General Surgery (S.S.R.), and NUTRIM School for Nutrition, Toxicology and Metabolism (S.S.R.), Maastricht University Medical Centre, The Netherlands;

Consecutive oxidative cleavage reactions of these products or the reaction of amino groups with other reactive substances (e.g. α-dicarbonyls) yield advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that can alter the structures and functions of proteins. AGEs have been identified in all organisms, and their contents appear to rise with some diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. Here, we report a pilot study using highly sensitive and specific proteomics approach to identify and quantify AGE modification sites in plasma proteins by reversed phase HPLC mass spectrometry in tryptic plasma digests. In total, 19 AGE modification sites corresponding to 11 proteins were identified in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus under poor glycemic control. The modification degrees of 15 modification sites did not differ among cohorts of normoglycemic lean or obese and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients under good and poor glycemic control. The contents of two amide-AGEs in human serum albumin and apolipoprotein A-II were significantly higher in patients with poor glycemic control, although the plasma levels of both proteins were similar among all plasma samples. These two modification sites might be useful to predict long term, AGE-related complications in diabetic patients, such as impaired vision, increased arterial stiffness, or decreased kidney function.","Greifenhagen, UtaFrolov, AndrejBlüher, MatthiasHoffmann, Ralf","Greifenhagen UFrolov ABlüher MHoffmann R","From the Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy, the Center for Biotechnology and Biomedicine, and.From the Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy, the Center for Biotechnology and Biomedicine, and.the Department of Medicine, Endocrinology, Universität Leipzig, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.From the Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy, the Center for Biotechnology and Biomedicine, and hoffmann@chemie.uni-leipzig.de.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20160301","United States","J Biol Chem","The Journal of biological chemistry","2985121R","0 (Blood Proteins)0 (Glycation End Products, Advanced)","IM","Blood Proteins/*metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*bloodGlycation End Products, Advanced/*bloodHumansPilot Projects*Protein Processing, Post-Translational","PMC4850298",NA,"NOTNLM","Advanced glycation end productsbiomarkerglycationmass spectrometry (MS)post-translational modification (PTM)type 2 diabetes",NA,"2016/03/05 06:00","2016/11/11 06:00","2017/04/29","2016/03/03 06:00","2015/11/11 00:00 [received]2016/03/03 06:00 [entrez]2016/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]2016/11/11 06:00 [medline]2017/04/29 00:00 [pmc-release]","S0021-9258(20)43100-X [pii]M115.702860 [pii]10.1074/jbc.M115.702860 [doi]","ppublish","J Biol Chem. 2016 Apr 29;291(18):9610-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.702860.

Proteomics technology offers enormous promise to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying pathologies, however, the analysis of skeletal muscle is challenging. Using state-of-the-art multienzyme digestion and filter-aided sample preparation (MED-FASP) and a mass spectrometry (MS)-based workflow, we performed a global proteomics analysis of skeletal muscle from leptin-deficient, obese, insulin resistant (ob/ob) and lean mice in mere two fractions in a short time (8 h per sample). We identified more than 6000 proteins with 118 proteins differentially regulated in obesity. This included protein kinases, phosphatases, and secreted and fiber type associated proteins. Enzymes involved in lipid metabolism in skeletal muscle from ob/ob mice were increased, providing evidence against reduced fatty acid oxidation in lipid-induced insulin resistance. Mitochondrial and peroxisomal proteins, as well as components of pyruvate and lactate metabolism, were increased. Finally, the skeletal muscle proteome from ob/ob mice displayed a shift toward the ""slow fiber type."" This detailed characterization of an obese rodent model of T2D demonstrates an efficient workflow for skeletal muscle proteomics, which may easily be adapted to other complex tissues.","Schönke, MilenaBjörnholm, MarieChibalin, Alexander VZierath, Juleen RDeshmukh, Atul S","Schönke MBjörnholm MChibalin AVZierath JRDeshmukh AS","Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Section for Integrative Physiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Section for Integrative Physiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Section for Integrative Physiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Section for Integrative Physiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Section of Integrative Physiology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Department of Proteomics and Signal Transduction, Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany.Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Clinical Proteomics, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20180220","Germany","Proteomics","Proteomics","101092707","0 (Leptin)0 (Proteome)","IM","Animals*Insulin ResistanceLeptin/*physiologyMaleMiceMice, ObeseMuscle Fibers, Skeletal/*chemistry/metabolismMuscle, Skeletal/*metabolismProteome/*analysis*Thinness",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","fatty acid oxidationinsulin resistancemetabolismmitochondriaobesity",NA,"2018/01/20 06:00","2019/03/01 06:00",NA,"2018/01/20 06:00","2017/10/08 00:00 [received]2018/01/07 00:00 [revised]2018/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]2019/03/01 06:00 [medline]2018/01/20 06:00 [entrez]","10.1002/pmic.201700375 [doi]","ppublish","Proteomics. 2018 Mar;18(5-6):e1700375. doi: 10.1002/pmic.201700375.

However, unlike transcriptomics and proteomics there is currently no central repository for the depositing of data despite efforts by the Metabolomics Standard Initiative (MSI) to develop a standardised description of a metabolomic experiment. FINDINGS: In this manuscript we describe how the MSI description has been applied to a published dataset involving the identification of cross-species metabolic biomarkers associated with type II diabetes. The study describes sample collection of urine from mice, rats and human volunteers, and the subsequent acquisition of data by high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy. The metadata is described to demonstrate how the MSI descriptions could be applied in a manuscript and the spectra have also been made available for the mouse and rat studies to allow others to process the data. CONCLUSIONS: The intention of this manuscript is to stimulate discussion as to whether the MSI description is sufficient to describe the metadata associated with metabolomic experiments and encourage others to make their data available to other researchers.","Griffin, Julian LAtherton, Helen JSteinbeck, ChrisSalek, Reza M","Griffin JLAtherton HJSteinbeck CSalek RM","MRC Human Nutrition Research, Elsie Widdowson Laboratory, Fulbourn Road, Cambridge, CB1 9NL, UK.

Identifying novel biomarkers that predict ARB response may help tailor therapy. We aimed to discover and validate a serum metabolite classifier that predicts albuminuria response to ARBs in patients with diabetes mellitus and micro or macroalbuminuria. METHODS: Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics was performed on serum samples. Data from patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria (n = 49) treated with irbesartan 300 mg/day were used for discovery. LASSO and ridge regression were performed to develop the classifier. Improvement in albuminuria response prediction was assessed by calculating differences in R(2) between a reference model of clinical parameters and a model with clinical parameters and the classifier. The classifier was externally validated in patients with type 1 diabetes and macroalbuminuria (n = 50) treated with losartan 100 mg/day. Molecular process analysis was performed to link metabolites to molecular mechanisms contributing to ARB response. RESULTS: In discovery, median change in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was -42 % [Q1-Q3: -69 to -8]. The classifier, consisting of 21 metabolites, was significantly associated with UAE response to irbesartan (p < 0.001) and improved prediction of UAE response on top of the clinical reference model (R(2) increase from 0.10 to 0.70; p < 0.001). In external validation, median change in UAE was -43 % [Q1-Q35: -63 to -23]. The classifier improved prediction of UAE response to losartan (R(2) increase from 0.20 to 0.59; p < 0.001). Specifically ADMA impacting eNOS activity appears to be a relevant factor in ARB response. CONCLUSIONS: A serum metabolite classifier was discovered and externally validated to significantly improve prediction of albuminuria response to ARBs in diabetes mellitus.","Pena, Michelle JHeinzel, AndreasRossing, PeterParving, Hans-HenrikDallmann, GuidoRossing, KasperAndersen, SteenMayer, BerndHeerspink, Hiddo J L","Pena MJHeinzel ARossing PParving HHDallmann GRossing KAndersen SMayer BHeerspink HJ","Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, P.

We sought to determine changes in protein expressions in arterial tissue from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moreover hypothesized that metformin intake influences the protein composition. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed nonatherosclerotic repair arteries gathered at coronary bypass operations from 30 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and from 30 ageand sex-matched nondiabetic individuals. Quantitative proteome analysis was performed by isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation-labeling and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, tandem mass spectrometry analysis on individual arterial samples. The amounts of the basement membrane components, α1-type IV collagen and α2-type IV collagen, γ1-laminin and β2-laminin, were significantly increased in patients with diabetes mellitus. Moreover, the expressions of basement membrane components and other vascular proteins were significantly lower among metformin users when compared with nonusers. Patients treated with or without metformin had similar levels of hemoglobin A1c, cholesterol, and blood pressure. In addition, quantitative histomorphometry showed increased area fractions of collagen-stainable material in tunica intima and media among patients with diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSIONS: The distinct accumulation of arterial basement membrane proteins in type 2 diabetes mellitus discloses a similarity between the diabetic macroangiopathy and microangiopathy and suggests a molecular explanation behind the alterations in vascular remodeling, biomechanical properties, and aneurysm formation described in diabetes mellitus. The lower amounts of basement membrane components in metformin-treated individuals are compatible with the hypothesis of direct beneficial drug effects on the matrix composition in the vasculature.","Preil, Simone A RKristensen, Lars PBeck, Hans CJensen, Pia SNielsen, Patricia SSteiniche, TorbenBjørling-Poulsen, MarinaLarsen, Martin RHansen, Maria LRasmussen, Lars M","Preil SAKristensen LPBeck HCJensen PSNielsen PSSteiniche TBjørling-Poulsen MLarsen MRHansen MLRasmussen LM","From the Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Odense University Hospital (S.A.R.P., L.P.K., H.C.B., P.S.J., M.B.-P., M.L.H., L.M.R.) and Protein Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (M.R.L.), University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark;

The aim of the present study was to explore the application of SELDI proteomic patterns in serum for distinguishing between cases of pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy controls. METHODS: Sera from 12 healthy controls, 24 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 126 with pancreatic cancer, including 84 with diabetes, and 61 with chronic pancreatitis, 32 of which were diabetics, were analyzed using SELDI-TOF/MS. Spectra (IMAC-30) were clustered and classified using Biomarker Wizard and Biomarker Pattern software. RESULTS: Two decision tree classification algorithms, one with and one without CA 19-9, were constructed. In the absence of CA 19-9, the splitting protein peaks were: m/z 1526, 1211, and 3519; when CA 19-9 was used in the analysis, it replaced the m/z 3519 splitter. The two algorithms performed equally for classifying patients. A classification tree that considered diabetic patients only was constructed; the main splitters were: 1211, CA 19-9, 7903, 3359, 1802. With this algorithm, 100% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 97% with chronic pancreatitis and 77% of patients with pancreatic cancer were correctly classified. SELDI-TOF/MS features improved the diagnostic accuracy of CA 19-9 (AUC = 0.883 for CA 19-9; AUC = 0.935 for CA 19-9 and SELDI-TOF/MS features combined). CONCLUSIONS: SELDI-TOF/MS allows identification of new peptides which, in addition to CA 19-9, enable the correct classification of the vast majority of patients with pancreatic cancer, which can be distinguished from patients with chronic pancreatitis or type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Navaglia, FilippoFogar, PaolaBasso, DanielaGreco, ElianaPadoan, AndreaTonidandel, LorisFadi, ElisaZambon, Carlo-FedericoBozzato, DaniaMoz, StefaniaSeraglia, RobertaPedrazzoli, SergioPlebani, Mario","Navaglia FFogar PBasso DGreco EPadoan ATonidandel LFadi EZambon CFBozzato DMoz SSeraglia RPedrazzoli SPlebani M","Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.","eng",NA,"Journal Article",NA,"Germany","Clin Chem Lab Med","Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine","9806306","0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)0 (CA-19-9 Antigen)0 (Peptides)","IM","AdultAgedAged, 80 and overBiomarkers, Tumor/*bloodCA-19-9 Antigen/bloodCase-Control StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/diagnosisDiagnosis, DifferentialDisease-Free SurvivalFemaleHumansMaleMiddle AgedPancreatic Neoplasms/blood/*diagnosis/mortalityPancreatitis, Chronic/blood/diagnosisPeptides/*bloodProportional Hazards ModelsProteomics/*methodsSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization/*methods",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2009/05/12 09:00","2009/10/09 06:00",NA,"2009/05/12 09:00","2009/05/12 09:00 [entrez]2009/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]","10.1515/CCLM.2009.158 [doi]","ppublish","Clin Chem Lab Med. 2009;47(6):713-23. doi: 10.1515/CCLM.2009.158.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1515/CCLM.2009.158",NA,2009

However, patients exposed to prolonged high levels of cortisol in Cushing syndrome (CS) present exceeding cardiometabolic alterations not reflected by conventional biomarkers. Using 3 ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) platforms, we aimed to characterise the serum metabolome of 25 patients with active endogenous CS and 25 control subjects matched by propensity score (sex, BMI, diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2D), high blood pressure (HBP) and dyslipidaemia) to search for potential disease-specific biomarkers and pathways associated to the clinical comorbidities. A total of 93 metabolites were significantly altered in patients with CS. Increased levels of sulfur amino acids (AA), triacylglycerols, glycerophospholipids, ceramides and cholesteryl esters were observed. Contrarily, concentrations of essential and non-essential AA, polyunsaturated fatty acids, conjugated bile acids and second messenger glycerolipids were decreased. Twenty-four-hour urinary free cortisol (24h-UFC) independently determined the concentration of 21 lipids and 4 AA. A metabolic signature composed by 10 AA and 10 lipid metabolites presented an AUC-ROC of 95% for the classification of CS patients. Through differential network analysis, 152 aberrant associations between metabolites involved in the Lands cycle and Kennedy pathway were identified. Our data indicates that chronic hypercortisolemia confers a unique lipidomic signature and several alterations in numerous AA even when compared to patients with similar metabolic comorbidities providing novel insights of the increased cardiometabolic burden of CS. KEY MESSAGES: • Cortisol excess induces metabolic alterations beyond conventional biomarkers. • The hypercortisolism extent determines the concentration of 21 lipids and 5 aa. • Cortisol excess confers a unique metabolic signature of 20 metabolites. • Kennedy and Lands cycle are profoundly disturbed by cortisol excess.","Vega-Beyhart, ArturoIruarrizaga, MartaPané, AdrianaGarcía-Eguren, GuillermoGiró, OriolBoswell, LauraAranda, GloriaFlores, VanesaCasals, GregoriAlonso, CristinaMora, MireiaHalperin, IreneCarmona, FrancescEnseñat, JoaquimVidal, OscarHu, TingRojo, GemmaGomis, RamonHanzu, Felicia A","Vega-Beyhart AAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-0373-1573Iruarrizaga MPané AGarcía-Eguren GGiró OBoswell LAranda GFlores VCasals GAlonso CMora MHalperin ICarmona FEnseñat JVidal OHu TRojo GGomis RHanzu FAAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2399-4023","Group of Endocrine Disorders, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Carrer Rosselló, 149, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.Endocrinology and Nutrition Department, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain.OWL Metabolomics, Derio, Spain.Endocrinology and Nutrition Department, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain.Group of Endocrine Disorders, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Carrer Rosselló, 149, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.Group of Endocrine Disorders, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Carrer Rosselló, 149, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.Group of Endocrine Disorders, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Carrer Rosselló, 149, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.Endocrinology and Nutrition Department, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain.Group of Endocrine Disorders, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Carrer Rosselló, 149, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.Group of Endocrine Disorders, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Carrer Rosselló, 149, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.Endocrinology and Nutrition Department, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain.Biomedical diagnostics Centre, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain.OWL Metabolomics, Derio, Spain.Group of Endocrine Disorders, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Carrer Rosselló, 149, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.Endocrinology and Nutrition Department, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain.Group of Endocrine Disorders, Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Carrer Rosselló, 149, 08036, Barcelona, Spain.Endocrinology and Nutrition Department, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain.Surgery Department, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain.Surgery Department, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain.Surgery Department, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain.School of Computing, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada.Endocrinology and Nutrition Clinical Management Unit.

Increased sulfide production or sulfide donor compounds may beneficially regulate hepatic metabolism. Disposal of sulfide through the sulfide oxidation pathway (SOP) is critical for maintaining sulfide within a safe physiological range. We show that mice lacking the liver enriched mitochondrial SOP enzyme thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (Tst(-/-) mice) exhibit high circulating sulfide, increased gluconeogenesis, hypertriglyceridemia, and fatty liver. Unexpectedly, hepatic sulfide levels are normal in Tst(-/-) mice because of exaggerated induction of sulfide disposal, with associated suppression of global protein persulfidation and nuclear respiratory factor 2 target protein levels. Hepatic proteomic and persulfidomic profiles converge on gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism, revealing a selective deficit in medium-chain fatty acid oxidation in Tst(-/-) mice. We reveal a critical role of TST in hepatic metabolism that has implications for sulfide donor strategies in the context of metabolic disease.","Carter, Roderick NGibbins, Matthew T GBarrios-Llerena, Martin EWilkie, Stephen EFreddolino, Peter LLibiad, MarouaneVitvitsky, VictorEmerson, BarryLe Bihan, ThierryBrice, MadaraSu, HuizhongDenham, Scott GHomer, Natalie Z MMc Fadden, ClareTailleux, AnneFaresse, NourdineSulpice, ThierryBriand, FrancoisGillingwater, TomAhn, Kyo HanSingha, SubhankarMcMaster, ClaireHartley, Richard CStaels, BartGray, Gillian AFinch, Andrew JSelman, ColinBanerjee, RumaMorton, Nicholas M","Carter RNGibbins MTGBarrios-Llerena MEWilkie SEFreddolino PLLibiad MVitvitsky VEmerson BLe Bihan TBrice MSu HDenham SGHomer NZMMc Fadden CTailleux AFaresse NSulpice TBriand FGillingwater TAhn KHSingha SMcMaster CHartley RCStaels BGray GAFinch AJSelman CBanerjee RMorton NM","University/British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK.University/British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK.University/British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK.University/British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK; Glasgow Ageing Research Network (GARNER), Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK.Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.University/British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK.SynthSys  Systems and Synthetic Biology, Edinburgh EH9 3JD, UK.University/British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK.Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, MRC Institute of Genetics & Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh EH4 2XR, UK.University/British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK.University/British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK.University/British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK.Université de Lille, INSERM, CHU Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, U101-EGID, 59000, Lille, France.Physiogenex S.A.S, Prologue Biotech, 516 rue Pierre et Marie Curie, 31670 Labège, France.Physiogenex S.A.S, Prologue Biotech, 516 rue Pierre et Marie Curie, 31670 Labège, France.Physiogenex S.A.S, Prologue Biotech, 516 rue Pierre et Marie Curie, 31670 Labège, France.College of Medicine & Veterinary Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Old Medical School (Anatomy), Teviot Place, Edinburgh EH8 9AG, UK.Department of Chemistry, POSTECH, 77 Cheongam-Ro, Nam-Gu, Pohang, Gyungbuk 37673, South Korea.Department of Chemistry, POSTECH, 77 Cheongam-Ro, Nam-Gu, Pohang, Gyungbuk 37673, South Korea.School of Chemistry, Joseph Black Building, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK.School of Chemistry, Joseph Black Building, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK.Université de Lille, INSERM, CHU Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, U101-EGID, 59000, Lille, France.University/British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK.Cancer Research UK Edinburgh Centre, MRC Institute of Genetics & Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh EH4 2XR, UK.Glasgow Ageing Research Network (GARNER), Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK.Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.University/British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK.

RESULTS: This review systematically examines the proteomic and metabolomic indicators associated with the cardiovascular effects of semaglutide. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies. The review utilizes advanced analytical technologies such as mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of semaglutide on insulin secretion, weight control, anti-inflammatory activities and lipid metabolism. These ""omics"" approaches offer critical insights into metabolic changes associated with cardiovascular health. However, challenges remain such as individual variability in expression, the need for comprehensive validation and the integration of these data with clinical parameters. These issues need to be addressed through further research to refine these indicators and increase their clinical utility. CONCLUSION: Future integration of proteomic and metabolomic data with artificial intelligence (AI) promises to improve prediction and monitoring of cardiovascular outcomes and may enable more accurate and effective management of cardiovascular health in patients with type 2 diabetes. This review highlights the transformative potential of integrating proteomics, metabolomics and AI to advance cardiovascular medicine and improve patient outcomes.","Vitorino, Rui","Vitorino RAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3636-5805","Department of Medical Sciences, Institute of Biomedicine iBiMED, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.Cardiovascular R&D Centre-UnIC@RISE, Department of Surgery and Physiology, Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.","eng","UIDB/04501/2020/European Union, QREN, FEDER, and COMPETE for funding Institute of Biomedicine (iBiMED)/POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007628/European Union, QREN, FEDER, and COMPETE for funding Institute of Biomedicine (iBiMED)/UIDP/00051/2020/Cardiovascular R&D Centre-UnIC@RISE/Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia/","Journal ArticleReview","20241014","England","Eur J Clin Invest","European journal of clinical investigation","0245331","53AXN4NNHX (semaglutide)62340-29-8 (Glucagon-Like Peptides)0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)0 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor)","IM","Humans*Glucagon-Like Peptides/pharmacology/therapeutic use*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy/metabolism*Proteomics*Metabolomics*Hypoglycemic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use*Cardiovascular DiseasesLipid Metabolism/drug effectsArtificial IntelligenceInsulin Secretion/drug effectsGlucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor/metabolism",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","GLP‐1 receptor agonistcardiovascular diseasesendothelial functioninflammation pathwayslipid metabolismmolecular mechanismspersonalized medicineproteomic biomarkerssemaglutidetherapeutic strategies",NA,"2024/10/14 12:23","2025/01/20 22:54",NA,"2024/10/14 10:43","2024/05/05 00:00 [received]2024/10/01 00:00 [accepted]2025/01/20 22:54 [medline]2024/10/14 12:23 [pubmed]2024/10/14 10:43 [entrez]","10.1111/eci.14334 [doi]","ppublish","Eur J Clin Invest. 2025 Feb;55(2):e14334. doi: 10.1111/eci.14334.

Because EVs can be transported to recipient cells via circulation, many researchers have been studying EVs from immune cells or cancer cells. Adipocytes are also considered endocrine cells and secrete adipokines such as adiponectin, regulating a variety of intracellular signaling pathways. Expansion of adipose tissue in obesity alters adipokine secretion, thereby increasing the risk of metabolic diseases. Characterization of adipocyte-derived exosomes is necessary to explain the communication between adipocytes and other cell types. In the present study, to identify proteins associated with adipocyte-derived exosomes, we isolated exosomes from adipose tissue of obese diabetic and obese nondiabetic rats. We identified proteins by analyzing exosomes from obese rats with type 2 diabetes and their matched control littermates using nano-liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry coupled with label-free relative quantification. We identified 509 proteins from adipocytes including 81 known adipokines; ~78% of all the identified proteins were categorized as exosome-associated proteins. Among the protein profiles, we uncovered 128 upregulated and 72 downregulated proteins, which are differentially expressed in OLETF adipocyte-derived exosomes. This study seems to demonstrate for the first time hundreds of proteins in exosomes released by adipocytes in obese rats and rats with type 2 diabetes. Thus, protein profiles of exosomes from adipocytes possibly indicate the transmission of signals as part of cell-cell communication and should further our understanding of obesity and diabetes-related diseases.","Lee, Jeong-EunMoon, Pyong-GonLee, In-KyuBaek, Moon-Chang","Lee JEMoon PGLee IKBaek MC","Department Molecular Medicine, Cell and Matrix Research Institute, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, 101 Dongin-dong 2 Ga, Jung-Gu, Daegu, 700-422, Republic of Korea.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"Netherlands","Protein J","The protein journal","101212092","0 (Proteins)0 (Proteome)","IM","Adipocytes/*metabolismAnimalsDiabetes Mellitus/*metabolismExosomes/*chemistry/metabolismMaleObesity/*metabolismProteins/analysis/chemistry/metabolismProteome/*analysis/chemistry/metabolismProteomicsRatsRats, Inbred OLETF",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015/05/23 06:00","2016/02/03 06:00",NA,"2015/05/23 06:00","2015/05/23 06:00 [entrez]2015/05/23 06:00 [pubmed]2016/02/03 06:00 [medline]","10.1007/s10930-015-9616-z [doi]","ppublish","Protein J. 2015 Jun;34(3):220-35. doi: 10.1007/s10930-015-9616-z.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/s10930-015-9616-z",NA,2015

However, glucose can also react with primary amino groups present in other cellular components, such as aminophospholipids (aminoPLs). Although it is proposed that glycated aminoPLs can induce many cellular responses and contribute to the development and progression of diabetes, the routes of their formation and their biological roles are only partially revealed. The same is true for the influence of glucose-derived modifications on the biophysical properties of PLs. Here we studied structural, signaling, and biophysical properties of glycated and glycoxidized phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). By combining high resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy it was possible to deduce the structures of several intermediates indicating an oxidative cleavage of the Amadori product yielding glycoxidized PEs including advanced glycation end products, such as carboxyethyland carboxymethyl-ethanolamines. The pro-oxidative role of glycated PEs was demonstrated and further associated with several cellular responses including activation of NFκB signaling pathways. Label free proteomics indicated significant alterations in proteins regulating cellular metabolisms. Finally, the biophysical properties of PL membranes changed significantly upon PE glycation, such as melting temperature (Tm), membrane surface charge, and ion transport across the phospholipid bilayer.","Annibal, AndreaRiemer, ThomasJovanovic, OlgaWestphal, DennisGriesser, EvaPohl, Elena ESchiller, JürgenHoffmann, RalfFedorova, Maria","Annibal ARiemer TJovanovic OWestphal DGriesser EPohl EESchiller JHoffmann RFedorova M","Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy, Universität Leipzig, Germany; Center for Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Universität Leipzig, Germany; Institute for Medical Physics and Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, Universität Leipzig, Germany; LIFE-Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases, Universität Leipzig, Germany.Institute for Medical Physics and Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, Universität Leipzig, Germany.Institute of Physiology, Pathophysiology and Biophysics; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Austria.Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy, Universität Leipzig, Germany; Center for Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Universität Leipzig, Germany.Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy, Universität Leipzig, Germany; Center for Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Universität Leipzig, Germany.Institute of Physiology, Pathophysiology and Biophysics; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Austria.Institute for Medical Physics and Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, Universität Leipzig, Germany; LIFE-Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases, Universität Leipzig, Germany.Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy, Universität Leipzig, Germany; Center for Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Universität Leipzig, Germany; LIFE-Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases, Universität Leipzig, Germany.Institute of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry and Mineralogy, Universität Leipzig, Germany; Center for Biotechnology and Biomedicine, Universität Leipzig, Germany.

Chromatographic separation was carried out on a Syncronis HILIC column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 5 μm) with the column temperature of 35°C and a mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile/120 mM ammonium acetate (89:11, v/v), and the run time was 11.0 min.

Specific amino acids may acutely and chronically regulate insulin secretion from the pancreatic β-cells. We recently identified a metabolic signature of N-acetyl leucine (Ac-Leu) that strongly predicts diabetes development in mice hair. The Ac-Leu appears to be a potential biomarker candidate related to diabetes. However, the determination of Ac-Leu in human hair has not been reported. We measured the Ac-Leu, and its structure is similar to N-acetyl isoleucine (Ac-Ile) in human hair by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). The developed method was applied to the determination of Ac-Leu and Ac-Ile in the hair of healthy volunteers (HV) and DP. METHODS: Ac-Leu, Ac-Ile and N-acetyl norleucine (Ac-Nle, IS) were extracted from human hair samples by a micropulverized extraction procedure, then separated on a C18 column by isocratic elution of acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid in water:0.1% formic acid (14:86, vol./vol.). MRM using the fragmentation transitions of m/z 174.1→86.1 in the positive ESI mode was performed to quantify the N-acetyl leucine, N-acetyl isoleucine and IS. RESULTS: Ac-Leu, Ac-Ile and Ac-Nle in the human hair samples were completely separated by isocratic elution of a 5.0 min duration wash program using a reversed-phase column, and sensitively detected by LC-MS/MS in the ESI(+) MRM mode. The amounts of Ac-Leu and Ac-Ile in the hairs of HV and DP were determined. When comparing the concentrations between DP and those from HV, a statistically significant correlation was observed for the Ac-Leu (p<0.001) and Ac-Ile (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is useful for the determination of Ac-Leu and Ac-Ile in the hairs of DP and HV. Human hair may serve as a noninvasive biosample for the diagnosis of diabetes.","Min, Jun ZheTomiyasu, YukiMorotomi, TakashiJiang, Ying-ZiLi, GaoShi, QingYu, Hai-FuInoue, KoichiTodoroki, KenichiroToyo'oka, Toshimasa","Min JZTomiyasu YMorotomi TJiang YZLi GShi QYu HFInoue KTodoroki KToyo'oka T","Laboratory of Analytical and Bio-Analytical Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, 52-1 Yada, Suruga-ku, Shizuoka 422-8526, Japan; Key Laboratory for Natural Resource of Changbai Mountain & Functional Molecules, Ministry of Education, College of Pharmacy, Yanbian University, Yanji 133002, Jilin Province, China.

We aimed to examine whether balanced diets could be better in reducing diabetes risk than plant-based diets. METHODS: In cross-sectional analysis of Environment-Inflammation-Metabolic-Diseases Study (EIMDS), we used a questionnaire to investigate the habit of balanced and plant-based diets. In the prospective analysis of UK Biobank, we used the plant-based diet index of health (hPDI) and unhealth (uPDI) to evaluate the plant-based diets, and defined the balanced diet as a daily intake of 5 categories and at least 12 types of food. After analyzing proteomic data in UK Biobank, we explored the causal relationship between signature proteins of balanced diets and incident diabetes based on summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). RESULTS: Compared to participants who had plant-based diets, those who had balanced diets showed a lower risk of diabetes in EIMDS (Odd Ratio 0.65, 95%CI 0.44-0.95). In UK Biobank, after excluding participants with unhealthy plant-based diets, participants with balanced diets still showed a lower diabetes risk than participants with plant-based diets (Hazard Ratio 0.86, 95%CI 0.77-0.95). Proteomic analysis identified 107 downregulated and 2 upregulated proteins that were associated with higher and lower risk of diabetes, respectively. In SMR analyses, the downregulated signature proteins of balanced diets (AGR2, DBI, IL17RA and SERPINH1) were causally associated with diabetes incidence. CONCLUSION: Adhered to a balanced diet is associated with a lower risk of diabetes compared to plant-based diet, which might be attributed to signature proteins such as AGR2, DBI, IL17RA and SERPINH1.","Kang, BingYin, XiaoqinChen, DeqingWang, YandanLv, JiangYanZhou, JiyongChen, XiangjunKou, XiaoxiaHang, XinYang, QingWu, RuiLuo, XuWang, ChangyuYang, ShuminLi, QifuHu, Jinbo","Kang BYin XChen DWang YLv JZhou JChen XKou XHang XYang QWu RLuo XWang CYang SLi QHu J","Department of Endocrinology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China; Department of Clinical Nutrition, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.Department of Endocrinology, The People's Hospital of Wansheng District, Chongqing 400800, China.Department of Geriatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China; Department of Endocrinology, The People's Hospital of Rongchang District, Chongqing 402460, China.Department of Endocrinology, The People's Hospital of Wansheng District, Chongqing 400800, China.Department of Endocrinology, The People's Hospital of Rongchang District, Chongqing 402460, China.Department of Clinical Nutrition, The People's Hospital of Rongchang District, Chongqing 400016, China.Department of Endocrinology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.Department of Endocrinology, The People's Hospital of Wansheng District, Chongqing 400800, China.Department of Endocrinology, The People's Hospital of Wansheng District, Chongqing 400800, China.Department of Endocrinology, The People's Hospital of Wansheng District, Chongqing 400800, China.Department of Endocrinology, The People's Hospital of Rongchang District, Chongqing 402460, China.Department of Endocrinology, The People's Hospital of Rongchang District, Chongqing 402460, China.Department of Endocrinology, The People's Hospital of Rongchang District, Chongqing 402460, China.Department of Endocrinology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.

Although several parameters are used to evaluate renal damage, in many instances, there is no pathological change until damage is already advanced. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a novel tool to identify newer diagnostic markers. To identify urinary proteins associated with renal complications in diabetes, we collected urine samples from 10 type 2 diabetes patients each with normoalbuminuria, micro and macro-albuminuria and compared their urinary proteome with that of 10 healthy individuals. Urinary proteins were concentrated, depleted of albumin and five other abundant plasma proteins and in-gel trypsin digested after prefractionation on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The peptides were analyzed using a nanoflow reverse phase liquid chromatography system coupled to linear trap quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. We identified large number of proteins in each group, of which many were exclusively present in individual patient groups. A total of 53 proteins were common in all patients but were absent in the controls. The majority of the proteins were functionally binding, biologically involved in metabolic processes, and showed enrichment of alternative complement and blood coagulation pathways. In addition to identifying reported proteins such as α2-HS-glycoprotein and Vitamin D binding protein, we detected novel proteins such as CD59, extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), factor H, and myoglobin in the urine of macroalbuminuria patients. ECM1 and factor H are known to influence mesangial cell proliferation, and CD59 causes microvascular damage by influencing membrane attack complex deposition, suggestive their biological relevance to DN. Thus, we have developed a proteome database where various proteins exclusively present in the patients may be further investigated for their role as stage-specific markers and possible therapeutic targets.","Marikanty, R KGupta, M KCherukuvada, S V BKompella, S S SPrayaga, A KKonda, SPolisetty, R VIdris, M MRao, P VChandak, G RDakshinamurty, K V","Marikanty RKGupta MKCherukuvada SVKompella SSPrayaga AKKonda SPolisetty RVIdris MMRao PVChandak GRDakshinamurty KV","CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India; Institute of Bioinformatics, International Technology Park, Bangalore, India.CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.Department of Biochemistry, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.Department of Pathology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.Department of Endocrinology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.Department of Nephrology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.","eng",NA,"Journal Article",NA,"India","Indian J Nephrol","Indian journal of nephrology","8914356",NA,NA,NA,"PMC5131383",NA,"NOTNLM","BiomarkerOrbitrapdiabetic nephropathyliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometrymicroalbuminuriaurinary proteomics","There are no conflicts of interest.","2016/12/13 06:00","2016/12/13 06:01","2016/11/01","2016/12/13 06:00","2016/12/13 06:00 [entrez]2016/12/13 06:00 [pubmed]2016/12/13 06:01 [medline]2016/11/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","IJN-26-434 [pii]10.4103/0971-4065.176144 [doi]","ppublish","Indian J Nephrol. 2016 Nov-Dec;26(6):434-445. doi: 10.4103/0971-4065.176144.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2016

Recombinant native GLP-1 protein levels in media of transfected cells reached 23 ng/L while our DPP-IV resistant analogues resulted in a fivefold increase of GLP-1 protein levels (115 ng/L) relative to native GLP-1, and equivalent to the Lipofectamine positive control. We also found that all chitosan-DPP-IV siRNA nanocomplexes were capable of DPP-IV silencing, with 92-10-5 being significantly more effective in abrogating enzymatic activity of DPP-IV in media of silenced cells, and with no apparent cytotoxicity. These results indicate that specific chitosan formulations may be effectively used for the delivery of plasmid DNA and siRNA in a combination therapy of type 2 diabetes.","Jean, MyriamAlameh, MohamadDe Jesus, DiogoThibault, MarcLavertu, MarcDarras, VincentNelea, MonicaBuschmann, Michael DMerzouki, Abderrazzak","Jean MAlameh MDe Jesus DThibault MLavertu MDarras VNelea MBuschmann MDMerzouki A","Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, École Polytechnique, P.O.

Previously developed techniques have shown several limitations to further evaluate D-lactate as a biomarker for this condition. METHODS: D and L-lactate were quantified using ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with labelled internal standard. Samples were derivatized with diacetyl-L-tartaric anhydride and separated on a C(18)-reversed phase column. D and L-lactate were analysed in plasma and urine of controls, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). RESULTS: Quantitative analysis of D and L-lactate was achieved successfully. Calibration curves were linear (r(2) > 0.99) over the physiological and pathophysiological ranges. Recoveries for urine and plasma were between 96% and 113%. Inter and intra-assay variations were between 2% and 9%. The limits of detection of D-lactate and L-lactate in plasma were 0.7 μmol/L and 0.2 μmol/L, respectively. The limits of detection of D-lactate and L-lactate in urine were 8.1 nmol/mmol creatinine and 4.4 nmol/mmol creatinine, respectively. Plasma and urinary levels of D and L-lactate were increased in patients with IBD and T2DM as compared with controls. CONCLUSION: The presented method proved to be suitable for the quantification of D and L-lactate and opens the possibility to explore the use of D-lactate as a biomarker.","Scheijen, Jean L J MHanssen, Nordin M Jvan de Waarenburg, Marjo P HJonkers, Daisy M A EStehouwer, Coen D ASchalkwijk, Casper G","Scheijen JLHanssen NMvan de Waarenburg MPJonkers DMStehouwer CDSchalkwijk CG","Laboratory for Metabolism and Vascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Maastricht University, P.

The 2-DE analysis demonstrated that 92 spots from about 900 visualized spots were differentially regulated, of which 40 spots were identified as principal diabetes-associated proteins.

Western blot analysis revealed that the altered levels of the two regulatory molecules highlighted in diabetes and obesity (e.g., resistin and adiponectin) were also normalized in response to EPS. The Mouse Diabetes PCR Array profiles showed that the expression of 84 genes related to the onset, development, and progression of diabetes were significantly downregulated in liver, adipocyte, and muscle of ob/ob mice.

OBJECTIVE: Here our main objective was to elucidate further the pathogenic processes that underlie neurodegeneration in HD. METHODS: By using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis we performed a proteomic case-control study of two brain regions in post-mortem human tissue from seven well-characterized HD patients and eight matched controls. RESULTS: In the middle frontal gyrus we identified twenty-two differentially-expressed proteins whereas by contrast in visual cortex only seven were altered. Twenty of these proteins have not to our knowledge been associated with the pathogenesis of HD before although all functional families implicated have previously been linked to other neurodegenerative diseases. Most of the proteins identified play roles in cell stress responses, apoptosis, metabolic regulation linked to type-2 diabetes, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, or protein trafficking/endocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that HTT mutations lead to or cause functional impairment of these pathways and that simultaneous restoration of their functions by targeted pharmacotherapy could ameliorate the signs and symptoms of HD. These studies provide a unique illustration of the interlinked disease processes that underpin/contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in a genetically-mediated disorder of protein structure, and provide a signpost towards the design of new therapeutic interventions.","Schönberger, Sarah JJezdic, DinaFaull, Richard L MCooper, Garth J S","Schönberger SJJezdic DFaull RLCooper GJ","School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand Centre for Brain Research, Faculty of Medical & Health Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.Centre for Brain Research, Faculty of Medical & Health Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.School of Biological Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand Faculty of Science, Maurice Wilkins Centre for Molecular Biodiscovery, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand Centre for Brain Research, Faculty of Medical & Health Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, Institute of Human Development, The University of Manchester, and Centre for Advanced Discovery and Experimental Therapeutics (CADET), Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, UK.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"United States","J Huntingtons Dis","Journal of Huntington's disease","101589965",NA,"IM","AgedAged, 80 and overBrain/*metabolismCase-Control StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*metabolismElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-DimensionalFemaleHumansHuntington Disease/*metabolismMaleMiddle AgedNeurodegenerative Diseases/*metabolismPeptide MappingProteomics",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","Dementiacopperexperimental therapeuticshuman brainmetabolic stressoxidative stresstype-2 diabetes",NA,"2013/01/01 00:00","2014/09/10 06:00",NA,"2014/07/27 06:00","2014/07/27 06:00 [entrez]2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]2014/09/10 06:00 [medline]","N57V641418V77503 [pii]10.3233/JHD-120044 [doi]","ppublish","J Huntingtons Dis. 2013;2(1):89-99. doi: 10.3233/JHD-120044.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3233/JHD-120044",NA,2013

Monocytic cells (THP-1) were primed with high glucose (HG), their protein profiles were analyzed using 2DE and the downregulated differentially expressed spots were identified using MALDI TOF/MS. We selected five proteins that were secretory in function with the help of bioinformatic programs. A predominantly downregulated protein identified as cyclophilin A (sequence coverage 98%) was further validated by immunoblotting experiments. The cellular mRNA levels of cyclophilin A in various HG-primed cells were studied using qRT-PCR assays and it was observed to decrease in a dose-dependent manner. LC-ESI-MS was used to identify this protein in the conditioned media of HG-primed cells and confirmed by Western blotting as well as ELISA. Cyclophilin A was also detected in the plasma of patients with diabetes. We conclude that cyclophilin A is secreted by monocytes in response to HG. Given the paracrine and autocrine actions of cyclophilin A, the secreted immunophilin could be significant for progression of atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes.

Cardiomyocytes were isolated by Langendorff perfusion and subjected to iTRAQ-based quantitative membrane proteomic profiling, immunoblotting, and real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Compared to controls, elderly T2DM mice showed worse systolic function, more myocardial fibrosis and up-regulation of several heart failure markers (all p < 0.05). Cardiomyocyte membrane proteomic profiling revealed that 417 proteins had differential expressions related to perturbations in several biological processes in T2DM mice compared with the control. The most up-regulated proteins were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, whereas many down-regulated proteins were involved in cytoskeletal regulation. Differential protein expression correlated with myocardial systolic velocity by tissue Doppler. In addition, cardiomyocyte immunofluorescence staining showed greater disorganization of thick/parallel F-actin stress fibers and marked reduction in F-to-G-actin ratio in T2DM vs control (p < 0.05), which paralleled worsened myocardial systolic velocity.

Huge research efforts focused on gene expression, cellular signalling and metabolism in obesity have improved our understanding of these disorders; nevertheless, to bridge the gap between the regulation of gene expression and changes in signalling/metabolism, protein levels must be assessed. We have extensively analysed visceral adipose tissue from age-, T2DM and gender-matched obese patients using high-throughput proteomics and systems biology methods to identify new biomarkers for the onset of T2DM in obesity, as well as to gain insight into the influence of aging and gender in these disorders. About 250 proteins showed significant abundance differences in the age, T2DM and gender comparisons. In diabetic patients, remarkable gender-specific hallmarks were discovered regarding redox status, immune response and adipose tissue accumulation.

Systems biology analysis highlighted mitochondrial proteins that could play a key role in the age-dependent pathophysiology of T2DM.

The up-regulation of the low-molecular-mass heat shock protein Hsp27 was confirmed by an alternative fluorescent staining method of two-dimensional gels and immunoblotting. The observed protein alterations in the cellular stress response, distinct metabolic pathways, regulatory mechanisms and the contractile apparatus might be directly or indirectly associated with peripheral resistance to insulin signalling, making these newly identified muscle proteins potential biomarkers of type-2 diabetes.

While the literature is clear that there is genetic regulation of physical activity with existing gene knockout data suggesting that skeletal muscle mechanisms contribute to the regulation of activity, actual differences in end-protein expression between high and low-active mice have not been investigated. This study used two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry to evaluate the proteomic differences between high-active (C57L/J) and low-active (C3H/HeJ) mice in the soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL). Furthermore, vivo-morpholinos were used to transiently knockdown candidate proteins to confirm their involvement in physical activity regulation. Proteins with higher expression patterns generally fell into the calcium-regulating and Krebs (TCA) cycle pathways in the high-active mice (e.g., annexin A6, P = 0.0031; calsequestrin 1; P = 0.000025), while the overexpressed proteins in the low-active mice generally fell into cytoskeletal structure and electron transport chain-related pathways (e.g., ATPase, P = 0.031; NADH dehydrogenase, P = 0.027). Transient knockdown of annexin A6 and calsequestrin 1 protein of high-active mice with vivo-morpholinos resulted in decreased physical activity levels (P = 0.001). These data suggest that high and low-active mice have unique protein expression patterns and that each pattern contributes to the peripheral capability to be either high or low-active, suggesting that different specific mechanisms regulate activity leading to the high or low-activity status of the animal.","Ferguson, David PDangott, Lawrence JSchmitt, Emily EVellers, Heather LLightfoot, J Timothy","Ferguson DPDangott LJSchmitt EEVellers HLLightfoot JT","Children's Nutritional Research Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas;","eng","AR-050085/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","20140206","United States","J Appl Physiol (1985)","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","8502536","0 (Annexin A6)0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)0 (Calsequestrin)0 (Casq1 protein, mouse)0 (Muscle Proteins)0 (Proteome)","IM","AnimalsAnnexin A6/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolismCalcium-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolismCalsequestrinElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-DimensionalFemaleGene Knockdown TechniquesMaleMiceMice, Inbred C3HMice, Inbred C57BLModels, BiologicalMotor Activity/genetics/*physiologyMuscle Proteins/genetics/metabolismMuscle, Skeletal/*metabolismProteome/genetics/*metabolismSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray IonizationTandem Mass Spectrometry","PMC4035790",NA,"NOTNLM","2D-DIGEannexin A6calsequestrin 1mouse wheel runningvivo-morpholinos",NA,"2014/02/08 06:00","2015/05/12 06:00","2015/04/15","2014/02/08 06:00","2014/02/08 06:00 [entrez]2014/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]2015/04/15 00:00 [pmc-release]","japplphysiol.00911.2013 [pii]JAPPL-00911-2013 [pii]10.1152/japplphysiol.00911.2013 [doi]","ppublish","J Appl Physiol (1985). 2014 Apr 15;116(8):1057-67. doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.00911.2013.

Additionally, we analyzed the effects of drug treatment using the specific PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone. We integrated transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome data sets for a combined holistic view of molecular mechanisms in type 2 diabetes. Using network and pathway analyses, we identified hub proteins such as SDHB and SUCLG1 in WAT and deregulation of major metabolic pathways in the insulin-resistant state, including the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and branched chain amino acid metabolism. Rosiglitazone treatment resulted mainly in modulation via PPAR signaling and oxidative phosphorylation in WAT only. Interestingly, in HFD liver, we could observe a decrease of proteins involved in vitamin B metabolism such as PDXDC1 and DHFR and the according metabolites. Furthermore, we could identify sphingosine (Sph) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (SP1) as a drug-specific marker pair in the liver.

Human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), co-secreted with insulin by pancreatic β-cells, plays dual roles in both glycemic control and the pathology of type 2 diabetes. While IAPP can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and modulate cellular autophagy, apoptosis and extracellular matrix metabolism, no data is available concerning intracellular protein expression upon exposure to the polypeptide. More surprisingly, how intracellular protein expression is modulated by nanoparticle inhibitors of protein aggregation remains entirely unknown. In this study, we first examined the changing proteomes of βTC6, a pancreatic β-cell line, upon exposure to monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar IAPP, and detailed cellular protein expression rescued by graphene quantum dots (GQDs), an IAPP inhibitor. We found that 29 proteins were significantly dysregulated by the IAPP species, while majority of these proteins were nucleotide-binding proteins. Collectively, our liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry, fluorescence quenching, helium ion microscopy, cytotoxicity and discreet molecular dynamics simulations data revealed a remarkable capacity of GQDs in regulating aberrant protein expression through H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions, pointing to nanomedicine as a new frontier against human amyloid diseases.","Faridi, AvaSun, YunxiangMortimer, MonikaAranha, Ritchlynn RNandakumar, AparnaLi, YuhuanJaved, IbrahimKakinen, AleksandrFan, QingqingPurcell, Anthony WDavis, Thomas PDing, FengFaridi, PouyaKe, Pu Chun","Faridi ASun YMortimer MAranha RRNandakumar ALi YJaved IKakinen AFan QPurcell AWDavis TPDing FFaridi PKe PC","ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia.Department of Physics, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315211, China.Department of Physics and Astronomy, Clemson University, Clemson, SC 29634, United States.Institute of Environmental and Health Sciences, College of Quality and Safety Engineering, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.Infection and Immunity Program & Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia.ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia.ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia.ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia.ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia.ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia.Infection and Immunity Program & Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia.ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia.Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of Queensland, Brisbane Qld 4072, Australia.Department of Physics and Astronomy, Clemson University, Clemson, SC 29634, United States.Infection and Immunity Program & Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia.ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-Nano Science and Technology, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, 381 Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia.","eng","R35 GM119691/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States","Journal Article","20190926","China","Nano Res","Nano research","101518856",NA,NA,NA,"PMC6834229","NIHMS1052625","NOTNLM","IAPPamyloidgraphene quantum dotoligomerprotein expression",NA,"2019/11/07 06:00","2019/11/07 06:01","2020/11/01","2019/11/08 06:00","2019/11/08 06:00 [entrez]2019/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]2019/11/07 06:01 [medline]2020/11/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1007/s12274-019-2520-7 [doi]","ppublish","Nano Res. 2019 Nov;12(11):2827-2834. doi: 10.1007/s12274-019-2520-7.

We identified 36 putative biomarker genes in db/db kidneys: 31 upregulated and 5 downregulated. Urinary protein levels of six selected candidates (endothelin-1, lipocalin-2, transforming growth factor-β, growth and differentiation factor-15, interleukin-6, and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1) were elevated in type 2 diabetic patients with subnormal glomerular filtration rate (i.e., <90 ml·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2)), independent of microalbuminuria, age, sex, race, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists. In contrast, urinary levels of fibroblast growth factor were not increased. A composite variable of urine albumin and any of the six candidate markers was associated with subnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate more closely than albumin alone. In addition, urinary endothelin-1, growth and differentiation factor-15, and interleukin-6 were associated with a marker of proximal tubule damage, N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase activity.

Because mTOR inhibition with rapamycin protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury, we hypothesized that rapamycin would prevent cardiac dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We also investigated the possible mechanisms and novel protein targets involved in rapamycin-induced preservation of cardiac function in T2D mice. Adult male leptin receptor null, homozygous db/db, or wild type mice were treated daily for 28 days with vehicle (5% DMSO) or rapamycin (0.25 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Cardiac function was monitored by echocardiography, and protein targets were identified by proteomics analysis. Rapamycin treatment significantly reduced body weight, heart weight, plasma glucose, triglyceride, and insulin levels in db/db mice. Fractional shortening was improved by rapamycin treatment in db/db mice. Oxidative stress as measured by glutathione levels and lipid peroxidation was significantly reduced in rapamycin-treated db/db hearts. Rapamycin blocked the enhanced phosphorylation of mTOR and S6, but not AKT in db/db hearts. Proteomic (by two-dimensional gel and mass spectrometry) and Western blot analyses identified significant changes in several cytoskeletal/contractile proteins (myosin light chain MLY2, myosin heavy chain 6, myosin-binding protein C), glucose metabolism proteins (pyruvate dehydrogenase E1, PYGB, Pgm2), and antioxidant proteins (peroxiredoxin 5, ferritin heavy chain 1) following rapamycin treatment in db/db heart.

Patients were enrolled to this study, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) below 7% was a threshold for properly controlled diabetic patients (CD) and poorly controlled diabetic patients (UD). Patients were further divided into two groups: diabetic patients without renal failure (NRF) and with renal failure (RF) according to the Glomerular Filtration Rate. Density and diameter of EVs were determined by Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensing. Additionally, EVs were visualized by means of Transmission and Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy. Nano-liquid chromatography coupled offline with mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS) was applied for proteomic analysis. RF had reduced density of EVs compared to NRF. The size distribution study showed that CD had larger EVs (mode) than UD (115 versus 109 nm; p < 0.05); nevertheless the mean EVs diameter was smaller in controls than in the CD group (123 versus 134 nm; p < 0.05). It was demonstrated that EVs are abundant in urine. Albumin, uromodulin, and number of unique proteins related to cell stress and secretion were detected in the EVs fraction. Density and size of urinary EVs reflect deteriorated renal function and can be considered as potential renal damage biomarkers.","Kamińska, AgnieszkaPlatt, MarkKasprzyk, JoannaKuśnierz-Cabala, BeataGala-Błądzińska, AgnieszkaWoźnicka, OlgaJany, Benedykt RKrok, FranciszekPiekoszewski, WojciechKuźniewski, MarekStępień, Ewa Ł","Kamińska AAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-0278-725XPlatt MKasprzyk JKuśnierz-Cabala BGala-Błądzińska AWoźnicka OJany BRKrok FPiekoszewski WKuźniewski MStępień EŁAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3589-1715","Department of Medical Physics, Marian Smoluchowski Institute of Physics, Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science, Jagiellonian University, 30-348 Kraków, Poland.Department of Chemistry, Loughborough University, Loughborough LE11 3TU, UK.Laboratory of High Resolution Mass Spectrometry, Regional Laboratory of Physicochemical Analysis and Structural Research, Faculty of Chemistry, Jagiellonian University, 30-060 Kraków, Poland.Department of Diagnostics, Chair of Clinical Biochemistry, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 31-501 Kraków, Poland.St' Queen Jadwiga Clinical District Hospital No. 2, 35-301 Rzeszów, Poland.Department of Cell Biology and Imaging, Institute of Zoology, Faculty of Biology and Earth Sciences, Jagiellonian University, 30-387 Kraków, Poland.Department of Solid State Physics, Marian Smoluchowski Institute of Physics, Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science, Jagiellonian University, 30-348 Kraków, Poland.Department of Solid State Physics, Marian Smoluchowski Institute of Physics, Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science, Jagiellonian University, 30-348 Kraków, Poland.Laboratory of High Resolution Mass Spectrometry, Regional Laboratory of Physicochemical Analysis and Structural Research, Faculty of Chemistry, Jagiellonian University, 30-060 Kraków, Poland; Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Jagiellonian University, 30-060 Kraków, Poland.Department of Nephrology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 31-501 Kraków, Poland.Department of Medical Physics, Marian Smoluchowski Institute of Physics, Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science, Jagiellonian University, 30-348 Kraków, Poland.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20161225","United States","J Diabetes Res","Journal of diabetes research","101605237","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","AgedBiomarkers/urineDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*physiopathology/urineDiabetic Nephropathies/*diagnosis/physiopathology/urine*Extracellular VesiclesFemaleGlomerular Filtration Rate/physiologyHumansKidney/*physiopathologyMaleMiddle Aged","PMC5220476",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","2017/01/21 06:00","2017/05/19 06:00","2016/12/25","2017/01/21 06:00","2016/09/28 00:00 [received]2016/11/08 00:00 [revised]2016/11/13 00:00 [accepted]2017/01/21 06:00 [entrez]2017/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]2017/05/19 06:00 [medline]2016/12/25 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1155/2016/5741518 [doi]","ppublish","J Diabetes Res. 2016;2016:5741518. doi: 10.1155/2016/5741518.

Diabetic kidney disease is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease across the world. Early identification of DKD is vitally important for the effective prevention and control of it. However, the available indicators are doubtful in the early diagnosis of DKD. This study is aimed at determining novel sensitive and specific biomarkers to distinguish DKD from their counterparts effectively based on the widely targeted metabolomics approach. Materials and Method. This case-control study involved 44 T2DM patients. Among them, 24 participants with DKD were defined as the cases and another 20 without DKD were defined as the controls. The ultraperformance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry system was applied for the assessment of the serum metabolic profiles. Comprehensive analysis of metabolomics characteristics was conducted to detect the candidate metabolic biomarkers and assess their capability and feasibility. RESULT: A total of 11 differential metabolites, including Hexadecanoic Acid (C16:0), Linolelaidic Acid (C18:2N6T), Linoleic Acid (C18:2N6C), Trans-4-Hydroxy-L-Proline, 6-Aminocaproic Acid, L-Dihydroorotic Acid, 6-Methylmercaptopurine, Piperidine, Azoxystrobin Acid, Lysopc 20:4, and Cuminaldehyde, were determined as the potential biomarkers for the DKD early identification, based on the multivariable generalized linear regression model and receiver operating characteristic analysis. CONCLUSION: Serum metabolites might act as sensitive and specific biomarkers for DKD early detection. Further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our findings.","Zhang, HangZuo, Jing-JingDong, Si-SiLan, YuanWu, Chen-WeiMao, Guang-YunZheng, Chao","Zhang HZuo JJAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6093-2684Dong SSLan YWu CWAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-7255-7615Mao GYAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4548-7524Zheng CAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1942-8854","Diabetes Center and Department of Endocrinology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No. 109 West Xueyuan Road, Wenzhou, China.Center on Clinical Research, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.Diabetes Center and Department of Endocrinology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No. 109 West Xueyuan Road, Wenzhou, China.Center on Clinical Research, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.Diabetes Center and Department of Endocrinology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No. 109 West Xueyuan Road, Wenzhou, China.Center on Clinical Research, School of Ophthalmology & Optometry, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.Center on Evidence-Based Medicine & Clinical Epidemiological Research, School of Public Health, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.Diabetes Center and Department of Endocrinology, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, No. 109 West Xueyuan Road, Wenzhou, China.The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20200302","United States","J Diabetes Res","Journal of diabetes research","101605237","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","AgedBiomarkers/bloodCase-Control StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*bloodDiabetic Nephropathies/blood/*diagnosisEarly DiagnosisFemaleHumansMaleMetabolomicsMiddle AgedTandem Mass Spectrometry","PMC7072115",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported.","2020/03/20 06:00","2021/01/07 06:00","2020/03/02","2020/03/20 06:00","2019/08/29 00:00 [received]2020/01/13 00:00 [revised]2020/02/11 00:00 [accepted]2020/03/20 06:00 [entrez]2020/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]2020/03/02 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1155/2020/3049098 [doi]","epublish","J Diabetes Res. 2020 Mar 2;2020:3049098. doi: 10.1155/2020/3049098. eCollection 2020.","Copyright © 2020 Hang Zhang et al.",NA,NA,"10.1155/2020/3049098",NA,2020

Ophiopogon japonicus is a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat diabetes for thousands of years. From our previous work, we know that MDG-1, a water-soluble β-D-fructan polysaccharide from O. japonicas could treat T2DM experimentally. However, MDG-1 is poorly absorbed and its mechanism of action is still unknown. Therefore, a GC TOF/MS-based metabonomic approach in combination with multivariate statistical analysis was performed to investigate the mechanism of MDG-1 in a spontaneous diabetic model. Female diabetic KKay mice (21 weeks old) were randomly divided into a diabetic group (n = 6, gavaged with distilled water) and a MDG-1-Diabetic group (n = 7, gavaged with MDG-1, 300 mg kg(-1)) and female C57BL/6 mice (21 weeks old) were set as controls (n = 6, gavaged with distilled water). After 8-weeks of treatment, feces samples were collected for GC-TOF/MS analysis. Consequently, 12 potential biomarkers were identified, including monosugars (D-tagatose, D-lyxose, D-erythrose, xylo-hexos-5-ulose, 2-deoxy-galactose), butanedioic acid, amino acids (phenylalanine, L-lysine, L-methionine, L-aspartic acid) and purine derivatives (7H-purine, 2'-deoxyinosine). We assume the monosugars and butanedioic acid were the fermentation products of MDG-1 by intestinal microbes and MDG-1 actions against diabetes might be accomplished through the absorbable monosugars and butanedioic acid via suppressing intestinal glucose absorption, enhancing liver glycogenesis, inhibiting glycogenolysis and promoting GLP-1 secretion. Besides, MDG-1 might alleviate diabetes and diabetic nephropathy by reducing 7H-purine and 2'-deoxyinosine. Further omics-driven studies including genomics, proteomics and metabonomics were considered to be carried out to provide direct evidence of gut microbiome contribution to MDG-1 actions.","Zhu, YunyunCong, WenjuanShen, LanWei, HaiWang, YuanWang, LingyiRuan, KefengWu, FeiFeng, Yi","Zhu YCong WShen LWei HWang YWang LRuan KWu FFeng Y","Engineering Research Center of Modern Preparation Technology of TCM, Ministry of Education, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 1200 Cailun Road, Shanghai, 201203, PR China. wendycong@126.com fyi@vip.sina.com.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"England","Mol Biosyst","Molecular bioSystems","101251620","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Plant Extracts)0 (Polysaccharides)0 (Prebiotics)0 (Purines)0 (polysaccharide MDG-1)AB6MNQ6J6L (Succinic Acid)W60KTZ3IZY (purine)","IM","AnimalsBiomarkers/*metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolismFeces/*chemistryFemaleFermentationGas Chromatography-Mass SpectrometryIntestines/microbiologyMetabolomicsMiceMice, Inbred C57BLMicrobiotaOphiopogon/*chemistryPlant Extracts/pharmacologyPolysaccharides/metabolism/*pharmacologyPrebioticsPurines/metabolismSuccinic Acid/metabolism",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013/12/03 06:00","2014/08/13 06:00",NA,"2013/12/03 06:00","2013/12/03 06:00 [entrez]2013/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]2014/08/13 06:00 [medline]","10.1039/c3mb70392d [doi]","ppublish","Mol Biosyst. 2014 Feb;10(2):304-12. doi: 10.1039/c3mb70392d.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1039/c3mb70392d",NA,2014

Oxidative stress induced by various oxidants in a random and destructive manner is considered to play an important role in the pathophysiology of a number of human disorders and diseases such as impaired glucose tolerance. We have developed an improved method for the measurement of in vivo lipid peroxidation, where the presence of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α), hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and 7-hydroxycholesterol (7-OHCh), as well as their parent molecules, linoleic acid (LA) and cholesterol (Ch), was determined by performing LC-MS/MS (for 8-iso-PGF2α, HODE, and HETE) and GC-MS (for 7-OHCh, LA, and Ch) after reduction with triphenyl phosphine and saponification by potassium hydroxide. We then applied this method to volunteers (n = 57), including normal type (n = 43), ""high-normal"" (fasting plasma glucose, 100-109 mg/dL, n = 7), pre-diabetic type (IGT, n = 5), and diabetic type (n = 2) subjects who are diagnosed by performing oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). Several biomarkers in plasma, such as insulin, leptin, adiponectin, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, high sensitivity-C-reactive protein, HbA1c, and glucose levels were measured during OGTT. We found that the fasting levels of (10 and 12-(Z,E) HODE)/LA increased significantly with increasing levels of HbA1c and glucose during OGTT and with insulin secretion and resistance index. In conclusion, 10 and 12-(Z,E)-HODE may be prominent biomarkers for the early detection of IGT and ""high-normal"" type without OGTT.","Umeno, AyaShichiri, MototadaIshida, NorikoHashimoto, YoshikoAbe, KaoriKataoka, MasatoshiYoshino, KohzohHagihara, YoshihisaAki, NanakoFunaki, MakotoAsada, YasuhikoYoshida, Yasukazu","Umeno AShichiri MIshida NHashimoto YAbe KKataoka MYoshino KHagihara YAki NFunaki MAsada YYoshida Y","National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20130515","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Adipokines)0 (Biomarkers)0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)0 (Linoleic Acids)0 (hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid)17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)","IM","Adipokines/bloodAdultBiomarkers/*bloodDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*diagnosisEarly DiagnosisFatty Acids, Unsaturated/*bloodFemaleGas Chromatography-Mass SpectrometryGlucose Tolerance TestHumansLinoleic Acids/*bloodMaleMiddle AgedOxidative StressSinglet Oxygen/*metabolism","PMC3655182",NA,NA,NA,"Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2013/05/22 06:00","2014/01/08 06:00","2013/05/15","2013/05/22 06:00","2013/02/28 00:00 [received]2013/03/27 00:00 [accepted]2013/05/22 06:00 [entrez]2013/05/22 06:00 [pubmed]2014/01/08 06:00 [medline]2013/05/15 00:00 [pmc-release]","PONE-D-13-09266 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0063542 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2013 May 15;8(5):e63542. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0063542.

Type-2 diabetes (T2D) imposes a significant health and socio-economic burden. Prior research on T2D salivary microbiome utilized methods such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, 16S rRNA sequencing, and low-throughput proteomics. RESULTS: We conducted ultrafast, in-depth MS-based proteomic and metaproteomic profiling of saliva from 15 newly diagnosed T2D individuals and 15 age-/BMI-matched healthy controls (HC). Using state-of-the-art proteomics, over 4500 human and bacterial proteins were identified in a single 21-min run. Bioinformatic analysis revealed host signatures of altered immune-, lipid-, and glucose-metabolism regulatory systems, increased oxidative stress, and possible precancerous changes in T2D saliva. Abundance of peptides for bacterial genera such as Neisseria and Corynebacterium were altered showing biomarker potential, offering insights into disease pathophysiology and microbial applications for T2D management. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a comprehensive mapping of salivary proteins and microbial communities, serving as a foundational resource for enhancing understanding of T2D pathophysiology. The identified biomarkers hold promise for advancing diagnostics and therapeutic approaches in T2D and its associated long-term complication Video Abstract.","Samodova, DianaStankevic, EvelinaSøndergaard, Mathilde SonneHu, NaiyuAhluwalia, Tarunveer SWitte, Daniel RBelstrøm, DanielLubberding, Anniek FrederikeJagtap, Pratik DHansen, TorbenDeshmukh, Atul S","Samodova DStankevic ESøndergaard MSHu NAhluwalia TSWitte DRBelstrøm DLubberding AFJagtap PDHansen TDeshmukh AS","Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, Copenhagen, 2200, Denmark.Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, Copenhagen, 2200, Denmark.Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, Copenhagen, 2200, Denmark.Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, Copenhagen, 2200, Denmark.Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Borgmester Ib Juuls Vej 83, Herlev, 2730, Denmark.Department of Biology, The Bioinformatics Center, University of Copenhagen, Ole Maaløes Vej 5, Copenhagen, 2200, Denmark.Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Bartholins Allé 2, Building 1260, Aarhus, 8000, Denmark.Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, Aarhus University Hospital, Palle Juul-Jensens, Boulevard 11, Entrance A, Aarhus, 8200, Denmark.Section for Clinical Oral Microbiology, Department of Odontology, University of Copenhagen, Nørre Allé 20, Copenhagen, 2200, Denmark.Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, Copenhagen, 2200, Denmark.Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, 420 Washington Ave SE, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA.Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, Copenhagen, 2200, Denmark. torben.hansen@sund.ku.dk.Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3B, Copenhagen, 2200, Denmark. atul.deshmukh@sund.ku.dk.","eng","74550801/European Foundation for the Study of Diabetes/NNF18CC0034900; NNF23SA0084103/Novo Nordisk Fonden/NNF18CC0034900; NNF23SA0084103/Novo Nordisk Fonden/","Journal Article","20250110","England","Microbiome","Microbiome","101615147","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Bacterial Proteins)0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)0 (Salivary Proteins and Peptides)","IM","Humans*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/microbiology/metabolism*Saliva/microbiology*Proteomics/methodsMaleMiddle AgedFemale*MicrobiotaBiomarkers/metabolismBacterial Proteins/geneticsAdultBacteria/classification/metabolism/genetics/isolation & purificationRNA, Ribosomal, 16S/geneticsComputational Biology/methodsSalivary Proteins and Peptides/metabolismCase-Control StudiesAged","PMC11720885",NA,"NOTNLM","BiomarkerDIA-PASEFGenusMetaproteomicsMicrobiomePeptideProteinSalivaType-2 diabetes","Ethics approval and consent to participate: Ethical approval was obtained from the scientific ethics committee in the Central Denmark Region (no.: 20000183).

Plasma levels of free metabolites (3-deoxyfructose, 3-deoxypentosone, 3-deoxypentulose), two hydroimidazolones, oxidised adducts (carboxymethyllysine, carboxyethyllysine, methionine sulfoxide) and Nε-fructosyllysine were measured using LC-MS/MS. Plasma concentrations of all tested AGEs did not differ between the NFG and IFG groups (all p>0.05). Associations between plasma levels of AGEs and fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR as a measure of insulin resistance were weak (r between -0.2 and 0.2, all p>0.05). The association between 3-deoxyglucosone-derived hydroimidazolone with several proinflammatory biomarkers disappeared upon adjustment for multiple testing. In conclusion, plasma AGEs assessed by LC-MS/MS were neither increased in IFG nor associated with parameters of glucose metabolism and subclinical inflammation in our study. Thus, these data argue against strong effects of AGEs in the early stages of deterioration of glucose metabolism.","Teichert, TomHellwig, AnnePeßler, AnnetteHellwig, MichaelVossoughi, MohammadSugiri, DorotheaVierkötter, AndreaSchulte, ThomasFreund, JulianeRoden, MichaelHoffmann, BarbaraSchikowski, TamaraLuckhaus, ChristianKrämer, UrsulaHenle, ThomasHerder, Christian","Teichert THellwig APeßler AHellwig MVossoughi MSugiri DVierkötter ASchulte TFreund JRoden MHoffmann BSchikowski TLuckhaus CKrämer UHenle THerder C","Institute for Clinical Diabetology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany; German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD e.V.), Partner Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.Institute of Food Chemistry, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany.Institute of Food Chemistry, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany.Institute of Food Chemistry, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany.IUF-Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.IUF-Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.IUF-Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.Institute of Food Chemistry, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany.Institute for Clinical Diabetology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany; German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD e.V.), Partner Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany; Department of Endocrinology and Diabetology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.IUF-Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany; Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.IUF-Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany; Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland; University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.IUF-Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.Institute of Food Chemistry, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany.Institute for Clinical Diabetology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany; German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD e.V.), Partner Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20150527","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Glycation End Products, Advanced)0 (Insulin)9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)EXV5374VEY (3-deoxyglucosone)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IM","AgedBiomarkers/bloodBlood Glucose/*metabolismChromatography, Liquid/methodsCross-Sectional StudiesDeoxyglucose/analogs & derivatives/bloodFasting/*bloodFemaleGlucose/*metabolismGlycation End Products, Advanced/*bloodHumansInflammation/blood/metabolismInsulin/bloodInsulin Resistance/physiologyPilot ProjectsPrediabetic State/blood/metabolismTandem Mass Spectrometry/methods","PMC4446029",NA,NA,NA,"Competing Interests: The authors of this manuscript have the following competing interests: Christian Herder is Editorial Board member of PLOS ONE.","2015/05/29 06:00","2016/04/06 06:00","2015/05/27","2015/05/29 06:00","2015/01/22 00:00 [received]2015/04/27 00:00 [accepted]2015/05/29 06:00 [entrez]2015/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]2016/04/06 06:00 [medline]2015/05/27 00:00 [pmc-release]","PONE-D-15-03182 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0128293 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2015 May 27;10(5):e0128293. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0128293. eCollection 2015.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0128293",NA,2015

Identification of a marker protein out of thousands became a feasible task during the proteomics era by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In this study, blood samples were obtained from 80 Bahraini subjects with and without T2DM, a subset was used for proteomic analysis by LC-MS/MS, while all samples were used for ELISA analysis of 3 proteins, TATA-box binding protein-associated factor RNA polymerase-1-C (TAF1C), ceruloplasmin (CERP) and fibronectin (FN). The former 2 proteins were selected from the T2DM-protein-panel identified by LC-MS/MS, and the latter was analyzed for validation of the setting. The main findings of the proteomic analysis are i. Identifications of 62 differentially expressed proteins in T2DM, ii. Upregulation of 71% of the identified proteins. While the ELISA analysis showed that; both TAF1C and FN were significantly increased in T2DM (P0.015 and P0.001, respectively), while CERP was not (P0.088). Logistic regression analysis: i. confirmed the above associations after correction for covariates, ii. Revealed an interaction between age and gender that affect the association of the proteins with T2DM. In conclusion, knowing that TAF1C is a prerequisite in ribosomal biogenesis, our ELISA results are suggestive of increased protein synthesis in T2DM, explaining the observed upregulation of the proteins identified by LC-MSMS. The association between T2DM and TAF1C is a novel finding that might open a new avenue in DM research.","Abdulwahab, Rabab AsgharAllaith, Abdul Ameer AShinwari, ZakiaAlaiya, AyodeleGiha, Hayder A","Abdulwahab RAAllaith AAAShinwari ZAlaiya AGiha HA","Integrated Science Division, College of Health Sciences, University of Bahrain, Manama, Bahrain; Al Jawhara Centre for Molecular Medicine and Inherited Disorders, Arabian Gulf University, Bahrain.Department of Biology College of science, University of Bahrain, Bahrain.Proteomics Unit, Stem Cell & Tissue Re-Engineering Program, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH&RC), P.O.

A range of computational tools is now available for both isotopically labeled and label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based quantitative proteomics. However, they are generally not comparable to each other in terms of functionality, user interfaces, information input/output, and do not readily facilitate appropriate statistical data analysis. These limitations, along with the array of choices, present a daunting prospect for biologists, and other researchers not trained in bioinformatics, who wish to use LC-MS-based quantitative proteomics. RESULTS: We have developed Corra, a computational framework and tools for discovery-based LC-MS proteomics. Corra extends and adapts existing algorithms used for LC-MS-based proteomics, and statistical algorithms, originally developed for microarray data analyses, appropriate for LC-MS data analysis. Corra also adapts software engineering technologies (e.g. Google Web Toolkit, distributed processing) so that computationally intense data processing and statistical analyses can run on a remote server, while the user controls and manages the process from their own computer via a simple web interface. Corra also allows the user to output significantly differentially abundant LC-MS-detected peptide features in a form compatible with subsequent sequence identification via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). We present two case studies to illustrate the application of Corra to commonly performed LC-MS-based biological workflows: a pilot biomarker discovery study of glycoproteins isolated from human plasma samples relevant to type 2 diabetes, and a study in yeast to identify in vivo targets of the protein kinase Ark1 via phosphopeptide profiling. CONCLUSION: The Corra computational framework leverages computational innovation to enable biologists or other researchers to process, analyze and visualize LC-MS data with what would otherwise be a complex and not user-friendly suite of tools. Corra enables appropriate statistical analyses, with controlled false-discovery rates, ultimately to inform subsequent targeted identification of differentially abundant peptides by MS/MS. For the user not trained in bioinformatics, Corra represents a complete, customizable, free and open source computational platform enabling LC-MS-based proteomic workflows, and as such, addresses an unmet need in the LC-MS proteomics field.","Brusniak, Mi-YounBodenmiller, BerndCampbell, DavidCooke, KellyEddes, JamesGarbutt, AndrewLau, HollisLetarte, SimonMueller, Lukas NSharma, VagishaVitek, OlgaZhang, NingAebersold, RuediWatts, Julian D","Brusniak MYBodenmiller BCampbell DCooke KEddes JGarbutt ALau HLetarte SMueller LNSharma VVitek OZhang NAebersold RWatts JD","Institute for Systems Biology, 1441 North 34th Street, Seattle, WA 98103, USA. mbrusnia@systemsbiology.org","eng","R21 DK071275/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States1R21-DK71275/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesN01-HV-8179/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesN01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesN01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20081216","England","BMC Bioinformatics","BMC bioinformatics","100965194","0 (Proteins)0 (Proteome)","IM","Chromatography, Liquid/*methodsComputational BiologyInternetMass Spectrometry/*methodsProteins/*analysisProteome/analysisProteomics/*methods*Software","PMC2651178",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2008/12/18 09:00","2009/04/02 09:00","2008/12/16","2008/12/18 09:00","2008/05/20 00:00 [received]2008/12/16 00:00 [accepted]2008/12/18 09:00 [entrez]2008/12/18 09:00 [pubmed]2009/04/02 09:00 [medline]2008/12/16 00:00 [pmc-release]","1471-2105-9-542 [pii]10.1186/1471-2105-9-542 [doi]","epublish","BMC Bioinformatics. 2008 Dec 16;9:542. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-9-542.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1186/1471-2105-9-542",NA,2008

With changes associated with modern life, increasing attention has been paid to chronic psychological stressors such as work stress. Chronic psychological stress can induce or aggravate diabetes mellitus, and conversely, with the deterioration of T2DM, patients often experience different degrees of depression, anxiety, and other negative emotions. In order to clarify the role of ZiBuPiYin recipe (ZBPYR) in regulating the liver mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteome to improve T2DM with chronic psychological stress, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified among Zucker lean littermates (control group), chronic psychological stress T2DM rats (model group), and ZBPYR administration rats (ZBPYR group) through iTRAQ with LC-MS/MS. Using Mfuzz soft clustering analysis, DEPs were divided into six different clusters. Clusters 1-6 contained 5, 68, 44, 57, 28, and 32 DEPs, respectively. Given that ZBPYR can alleviate T2DM symptoms and affect exploratory behavior during T2DM with chronic psychological stress, we focused on the clusters with opposite expression trends between model:control and ZBPYR:model groups. We screened out the DEPs in clusters 1, 3, and 4, which may be good candidates for the prevention and treatment of T2DM with chronic psychological stress, and further conducted bioinformatics analyses. DEPs were mainly involved in the insulin signaling pathway, oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid metabolism, lysosome-related processes, and lipid metabolism. This may indicate the pathogenic basis of T2DM with chronic psychological stress and the potential therapeutic mechanism of ZBPYR. In addition, two key proteins, lysosome-associated protein (Lamp2) and tricarboxylic acid cycle-related protein (Suclg1), may represent novel biomarkers for T2DM with chronic psychological stress and drug targets of ZBPYR. Western blot analyses also showed similar expression patterns of these two proteins in liver MAMs of the model and ZBPYR groups.","Xu, HuiyingZhou, WenZhan, LibinBi, TingtingLu, Xiaoguang","Xu HZhou WZhan LBi TLu X","Modern Research Laboratory of Spleen Visceral Manifestations Theory, School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.Modern Research Laboratory of Spleen Visceral Manifestations Theory, School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.Center for Innovative Engineering Technology in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, China.Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for TCM Viscera-State Theory and Applications, Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, China.Modern Research Laboratory of Spleen Visceral Manifestations Theory, School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.Department of Emergency Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Dalian University, Dalian, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20221103","Switzerland","Front Cell Dev Biol","Frontiers in cell and developmental biology","101630250",NA,NA,NA,"PMC9669571",NA,"NOTNLM","ZiBuPiYin recipechronic psychological stressmitochondria-associated ER membraneproteomicstype 2 diabetes mellitus","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","2022/11/22 06:00","2022/11/22 06:01","2022/01/01","2022/11/21 04:28","2022/07/16 00:00 [received]2022/10/18 00:00 [accepted]2022/11/21 04:28 [entrez]2022/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]2022/11/22 06:01 [medline]2022/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","995732 [pii]10.3389/fcell.2022.995732 [doi]","epublish","Front Cell Dev Biol. 2022 Nov 3;10:995732. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2022.995732. eCollection 2022.","Copyright © 2022 Xu, Zhou, Zhan, Bi and Lu.",NA,NA,"10.3389/fcell.2022.995732",NA,2022

This cross-sectional analysis of a multi-ethnic cohort aimed to search for proteins potentially involved in the susceptibility to salt sensitivity, hypertension, and hypertension-related complications. The study included individuals enrolled in African Prospective Study on the Early Detection and Identification of Cardiovascular Disease and Hypertension (African-PREDICT), Flemish Study of the Environment, Genes and Health Outcomes (FLEMENGHO), Prospective Cohort Study in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus for Validation of Biomarkers (PROVALID)-Austria, and Urinary Proteomics Combined with Home Blood Pressure Telemonitoring for Health Care Reform Trial (UPRIGHT-HTM). Sequenced urinary peptides detectable in 70% of participants allowed the identification of parental proteins and were compared between Blacks and Whites. Of 513 urinary peptides, 300 had significantly different levels among healthy Black (n = 476) and White (n = 483) South Africans sharing the same environment. Analyses contrasting 582 Blacks versus 1731 Whites, and Sub-Saharan Blacks versus European Whites replicated the findings. COL4A1, COL4A2, FGA, PROC, MGP, MYOCD, FYXD2, and UMOD were identified as the most likely candidates underlying the racially different susceptibility to salt sensitivity, hypertension, and related complications. Enriched pathways included hemostasis, platelet activity, collagens, biology of the extracellular matrix, and protein digestion and absorption. Our study suggests that MGP and MYOCD being involved in cardiovascular function, FGA and PROC in coagulation, FYXD2 and UMOD in salt homeostasis, and COL4A1 and COL4A2 as major components of the glomerular basement membrane are among the many proteins potentially incriminated in the higher susceptibility of Blacks compared to Whites to salt sensitivity, hypertension, and its complication. Nevertheless, these eight proteins and their associated pathways deserve further exploration in molecular and human studies as potential targets for intervention to reduce the excess risk of hypertension and cardiovascular complications in Blacks versus Whites.","An, De-WeiMartens, Dries SMokwatsi, Gontse GYu, Yu-LingChori, Babangida SLatosinska, AgnieszkaIsiguzo, GodsentEder,

Immunofluorescent staining was used to determine microvascular density. The proteomic signature in isolated primary CMECs was analyzed by using tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomic analysis. Some target proteins were verified by using western blot. RESULTS: Compared with db/m mice, cardiac microvascular density and left ventricular diastolic function were significantly reduced in db/db mice, and this reduction was attenuated by GCGR mAb treatment. A total of 199 differentially expressed proteins were upregulated in db/db mice versus db/m mice and downregulated in GCGR mAb-treated db/db mice versus db/db mice. The enrichment analysis demonstrated that fatty acid β-oxidation and mitochondrial fusion were the key pathways. The changes of the related proteins carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B, optic atrophy type 1, and mitofusin-1 were further verified by using western blot. The levels of these three proteins were upregulated in db/db mice, whereas this upregulation was attenuated by GCGR mAb treatment. CONCLUSION: GCGR antagonism has a protective effect on CMECs and cardiac diastolic function in diabetic mice, and this beneficial effect may be mediated via inhibiting fatty acid β-oxidation and mitochondrial fusion in CMECs.","Wang, PengWei, RuiCui, XiaonaJiang, ZongzheYang, JinZu, LingyunHong, Tianpei","Wang PAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5636-671XWei RAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8838-703XCui XJiang ZYang JAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6004-955XZu LHong TAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5744-5129","Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Cardiology and Institute of Vascular Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.NHC Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Molecular Biology and Regulatory Peptides; Key Laboratory of Molecular Cardiovascular Science, Ministry of Education, Beijing Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Receptors Research, Beijing, China.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Cardiology and Institute of Vascular Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Cardiology and Institute of Vascular Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Cardiology and Institute of Vascular Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Cardiology and Institute of Vascular Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.NHC Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Molecular Biology and Regulatory Peptides; Key Laboratory of Molecular Cardiovascular Science, Ministry of Education, Beijing Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Receptors Research, Beijing, China.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Cardiology and Institute of Vascular Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.","eng","2019-CCA-ACCESS-069/Chinese Cardiovascular Association-Access fund/81830022/National Natural Science Foundation of China/81970671/National Natural Science Foundation of China/81900789/National Natural Science Foundation of China/82070319/National Natural Science Foundation of China/7212127/Natural Science Foundation of Beijing/","Journal Article","20230819","Australia","J Diabetes","Journal of diabetes","101504326","0 (Receptors, Glucagon)0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)0 (Fatty Acids)","IM","MiceAnimalsReceptors, Glucagon/metabolismEndothelial Cells*Diabetic Cardiomyopathies/prevention & control/metabolism*Diabetes Mellitus, ExperimentalMitochondrial DynamicsProteomicsAntibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacologyFatty Acids","PMC10755618",NA,"NOTNLM","2型糖尿病cardiac microvascular endothelial cellsfatty acid β-oxidationglucagon receptortype 2 diabetes心脏微血管内皮细胞胰高血糖素受体脂肪酸β-氧化",NA,"2023/08/19 20:41","2024/01/02 11:43","2023/08/19","2023/08/19 08:03","2023/06/15 00:00 [revised]2023/04/19 00:00 [received]2023/07/26 00:00 [accepted]2024/01/02 11:43 [medline]2023/08/19 20:41 [pubmed]2023/08/19 08:03 [entrez]2023/08/19 00:00 [pmc-release]","JDB13458 [pii]10.1111/1753-0407.13458 [doi]","ppublish","J Diabetes. 2023 Dec;15(12):1081-1094. doi: 10.1111/1753-0407.13458.

Currently, however, there is no simple test for early detection of type 2 diabetes. Established diagnostic tests for the disease including oral glucose tolerance, fasting blood glucose, and hemoglobin A1c are relatively late markers where the disease has already progressed. Since blood is in direct contact with many tissues, we hypothesized that pathological tissue changes are likely to be reflected in proteomic profiles of plasma. METHODS: Mice were reared either on regular chow or a high-fat diet at weaning and several physiological responses (i.e., weight, fasting plasma glucose and insulin, and glucose tolerance) were monitored at regular time intervals. Plasma was collected at regular intervals for proteomic analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subsequent mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Onset of hyperinsulinemia with corresponding glucose intolerance was observed in 2 weeks and fasting blood glucose levels rose significantly after 4 weeks on the high-fat diet. Many proteins were found to exist in multiple forms (isoforms). Levels of some isoforms including plasma retinol binding protein, transthyretin, Apolipoprotein A1, and kininogen showed significant changes as early as 4 weeks which coincided with the very early development of glucose intolerance. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a proteomic approach to study the development of type 2 diabetes may uncover unknown early post-translationally modified diagnostic and/or therapeutic protein targets.","Okada, ShigeruList, Edward OSankaran, SudhaKopchick, John J","Okada SList EOSankaran SKopchick JJ","Edison Biotechnology Institute, Konneker Research Laboratories, Ohio University, The Ridges, Bldg. 25, Athens, OH 45701-2979, USA, Department of Pediatrics, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA.","eng","R01 AG019899/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United StatesR15 DK075436/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR15 DK075436-01A1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States","Journal Article",NA,"England","Clin Proteomics","Clinical proteomics","101184586",NA,NA,NA,"PMC2899708","NIHMS190218",NA,NA,NA,"2010/07/14 06:00","2010/07/14 06:01","2011/06/01","2010/07/14 06:00","2010/07/14 06:00 [entrez]2010/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]2010/07/14 06:01 [medline]2011/06/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1007/s12014-009-9040-5 [doi]","ppublish","Clin Proteomics. 2010 Jun 1;6(1-2):6-17. doi: 10.1007/s12014-009-9040-5.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2010

Between June 2017 and July 2019, 81 subjects with simple obesity and 102 healthy volunteers with normal weight were recruited. ELVs were isolated by ultra-centrifugation. The proliferations of β-cells and islets were measured by 5-ethynl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU). Protein components in ELVs were identified by Quantitative Proteomic Analysis and verified by Western blot and ELISA. The role of specific exosomal protein was analyzed by gain-of-function approach in ELVs released by 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Circulating ELVs from subjects with simple obesity inhibited β-cell proliferation in vitro without affecting its apoptosis, secretion, and inflammation. The protein levels of Rictor and Omentin-1 were downregulated in circulating ELVs from subjects with simple obesity and associated with the obesity-linked pathologic conditions. The ELV-carried Omentin-1 and Omentin-1 protein per se were validated to increase β-cell proliferation and activate Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, Omentin-1 in ELVs was downregulated by insulin. The circulating ELVs may act as a negative regulator for β-cell mass in nondiabetic obesity through inhibiting β-cell proliferation. This effect was associated with downregulated Omentin-1 protein in ELVs. This newly identified ELV-carried protein could be a mediator linking insulin resistance to impaired β-cell proliferation and a new potential target for increasing β-cell mass in obesity and T2DM.","Ge, QianXie, XinxinChen, XiangjunHuang, RongfengRui, Cheng-XueZhen, QiannaHu, RenzhiWu, MinXiao, XiaoqiuLi, Xi","Ge QXie XChen XHuang RRui CXZhen QHu RWu MXiao XLi X","Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, PR China.The Biology Science Institutes, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, PR China.Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, PR China.The Chongqing Key Laboratory of Translational Medicine in Major Metabolic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, PR China.The Biology Science Institutes, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, PR China.de Duve Institute, Catholic University of Louvain, Brussels 1200, Belgium.Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, PR China.Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, PR China.The Chongqing Key Laboratory of Translational Medicine in Major Metabolic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, PR China.The Chongqing Key Laboratory of Translational Medicine in Major Metabolic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, PR China.The Biology Science Institutes, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, PR China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20210102","Netherlands","Genes Dis","Genes & diseases","101635967",NA,NA,NA,"PMC9170582",NA,"NOTNLM","ExosomeObesityProliferationType 2 diabetes mellitusβ-Cell","The authors declared no conflict of interest.","2021/01/02 00:00","2021/01/02 00:01","2021/01/02","2022/06/10 02:31","2020/10/08 00:00 [received]2020/12/21 00:00 [revised]2020/12/27 00:00 [accepted]2022/06/10 02:31 [entrez]2021/01/02 00:00 [pubmed]2021/01/02 00:01 [medline]2021/01/02 00:00 [pmc-release]","S2352-3042(20)30168-9 [pii]10.1016/j.gendis.2020.12.011 [doi]","epublish","Genes Dis. 2021 Jan 2;9(4):1099-1113. doi: 10.1016/j.gendis.2020.12.011. eCollection 2022 Jul.","© 2021 Chongqing Medical University.

Current diagnosis consists of urine assays of microalbuminuria, which have inadequate specificity and sensitivity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used proteomic analyses to identify novel biomarkers of nephropathy in urine from type 2 diabetic patients with demonstrated normo-, micro-, or macroalbuminuria. Samples were analyzed by fluorescence two-dimensional (2-D) differential in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE), and protein identification was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: 2-D DIGE analysis of the urinary proteome in diabetes with nephropathy identified 195 protein spots representing 62 unique proteins. These proteins belonged to several functional groups, i.e., cell development, cell organization, defense response, metabolism, and signal transduction. Comparisons between control and diabetic subjects with different stages of renal dysfunction revealed the differential expression of several proteins. Spot volume quantification identified 7 proteins that were progressively upregulated with increasing albuminuria and 4 proteins that exhibited progressive downregulation. The majority of these potential candidate biomarkers were glycoproteins. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the ability of proteomic analyses to reveal potential biomarkers for diabetic nephropathy in urine, an important step forward in advancing accurate diagnosis and our understanding of disease mechanisms.","Rao, Paturi VLu, XinfangStandley, MelissaPattee, PatrickNeelima, GundupalleGirisesh, GudigeDakshinamurthy, K VRoberts, Charles T JrNagalla, Srinivasa R","Rao PVLu XStandley MPattee PNeelima GGirisesh GDakshinamurthy KVRoberts CT JrNagalla SR","Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences University, Hyderabad, India.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"United States","Diabetes Care","Diabetes care","7805975","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Proteome)AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)","IMEIN  Diabetes Care. 2007 May;30(5):1330","AlbuminuriaBiomarkers/*urineChromatography, LiquidCreatinine/metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*urineDiabetic Nephropathies/*urineElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-DimensionalHumansMass SpectrometryProteinuria/*urine*ProteomeReference Values",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2007/03/01 09:00","2007/04/28 09:00",NA,"2007/03/01 09:00","2007/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]2007/04/28 09:00 [medline]2007/03/01 09:00 [entrez]","30/3/629 [pii]10.2337/dc06-2056 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes Care. 2007 Mar;30(3):629-37. doi: 10.2337/dc06-2056.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2007

However, the exact mechanisms of NAFLD pathophysiology remain poorly understood including its progression to the more severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). New advances for early detection and monitoring of NASH progression are limited due to the lack of specific blood biomarkers, thus requiring invasive liver biopsies for histopathology. Herein, multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS/MS) is validated as a high throughput, robust, and quantitative platform for targeted analysis of a panel of 16 serum γ-glutamyl dipeptides from a cohort of NASH adult patients from Japan (median age = 53 years, median BMI = 27 kg/m(2), n = 116). Multiplexed separations based on MSI-CE-MS/MS enable the design of unique data workflows that rely on customizable serial sample injection formats for accurate determination of γ-glutamyl dipeptides with quality control. Also, the introduction of a liquid coolant device to the capillary outlet improves long-term migration time stability in CE. Unsupervised pattern recognition methods revealed two distinctive NASH subgroups based on their contrasting γ-glutamyl dipeptide status despite patients having similar clinical phenotypes and NASH activity scores (median NAS ≈ 6.0). There was an inverse correlation between serum γ-glutamyl dipeptide concentrations and γ-glutamyltransferease (GGT) enzyme activity (r = -0.46; p = 2.5 × 10(-7)), which was indicative of a low-risk (n = 64) as compared to a high-risk (n = 52) patient subgroup with impaired glutathione salvage pathway and likely poor clinical prognosis. Our findings highlight the key role of defects in the γ-glutamyl cycle for differentiation of NASH patients, which may enable better risk assessment of long-term survivorship as a complement to standard liver enzyme screens and histopathology.","Saoi, MichelleSasaki, KazunoriSagawa, HitoshiAbe, KaoriKogiso, TomomiTokushige, KatsutoshiHashimoto, EtsukoOhashi, YoshiakiBritz-McKibbin, Philip","Saoi MSasaki KSagawa HAbe KKogiso TTokushige KHashimoto EOhashi YAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2093-5519Britz-McKibbin PAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9296-3223","Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4M1, Canada.Human Metabolome Technologies, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-0052, Japan.Human Metabolome Technologies, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-0052, Japan.Human Metabolome Technologies, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-0052, Japan.Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo 162-8666, Japan.Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo 162-8666, Japan.Department of Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo 162-8666, Japan.Human Metabolome Technologies, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-0052, Japan.Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4M1, Canada.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20190926","United States","J Proteome Res","Journal of proteome research","101128775","0 (Dipeptides)GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)","IM","Adult*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2DipeptidesGlutathioneHigh-Throughput Screening AssaysHumansLiverMiddle Aged*Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/diagnosisRisk AssessmentTandem Mass Spectrometry",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","capillary electrophoresisgamma-glutamyl dipeptidesnonalcoholic fatty liver diseasetandem mass spectrometrytargeted metabolomics",NA,"2019/09/05 06:00","2021/06/22 06:00",NA,"2019/09/05 06:00","2019/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]2019/09/05 06:00 [entrez]","10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00405 [doi]","ppublish","J Proteome Res. 2020 Jul 2;19(7):2689-2699. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00405.

One side effect of this drug, hepatotoxicity, is well recognized; however, the precise mechanisms underlying tolbutamide-induced hepatotoxicity remain unclear. In this respect, proteomics techniques were used to gain further insight into the mechanistic processes of the hepatotoxicity induced by this drug. In this study, we aimed to identify molecular pathways based on proteins responding to cellular toxicity in tolbutamide-treated primary hepatocytes, using nano UPLC-MS/MS analysis. Rat primary hepatocytes were treated with an IC(20) concentration for 24 h to study the hepatotoxic effects of tolbutamide. For high-throughput label-free quantitation, tryptic-digested peptides of proteins from cell lysates were analyzed using LC-MS/MS and quantitated using the IDEAL-Q software, in which several parameters, such as assisted sequence, elution time, and mass-to-charge ratio were included. We quantified a total of 330 distinct proteins from the tolbutamide-treated hepatocytes and identified 55 upregulated and 82 downregulated proteins with expression changes. Among these differentially expressed proteins, we focused mainly on the 18 upregulated proteins belonging to xenobiotic cytochrome P450 (CYP), drug metabolism/detoxification, oxidative stress/antioxidant response, and cell damage pathway. CYP2D1, CYP2C11, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B (UGT2B), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), 60 kDa heat shock protein (HSPD1), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), and catalase (CAT) were confirmed by Western blot analysis. In addition, various xenobiotic CYP proteins upregulated in the tolbutamide-treated group, CYP2D1, CYP2C13, and CYP2C11 were confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis.

Identifying diagnostic biomarkers for DN at an early stage is crucial due to the considerable societal and economic burden associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) and its risk factors. In the past, early indicators of microvascular problems, such as microalbuminuria (MA), have been used to predict the possibility of developing advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, because of the incapacity of MA to appropriately estimate DN, particularly, non-albuminuric DN, additional markers have been suggested for recognizing the early renal abnormalities and structural lesions, even before MA. This study aims to assess the existing and future biomarkers used to diagnose or predict early DN. This review provides comprehensive insight into diagnostic approaches for early detection of CKD, addressing the following areas: (i) markers of glomerular damage, (ii) markers of tubular damage, (iii) oxidative stress biomarkers, (iv) inflammatory biomarkers and (v) futuristic biomarkers such as micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs), proteomics, metabolomics and genomics and gut microbiota. Early detection of DN may lead to improvement in clinical management and quality of life, emphasizing the importance of identifying a specific and reliable predictive biomarker.

Metformin, a widely known anti-diabetic drug, used for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, is also claimed to be useful in treatment of NAFLD. However, both the clinical efficacy and the putative mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of metformin in treating NAFLD are unclear. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the primary molecular target for metformin, is a known regulator of mitochondrial function. Thus, we used a proteomic approach to investigate the effect of metformin on liver mitochondria of apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE(-/-)) mice, an animal model of NAFLD. Two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry was applied to study the changes in liver mitochondrial protein expression in 6-month old metformin-treated apoE(-/-) mice as compared to non-treated animals. Collectively, 25 differentially expressed proteins were indentified upon metformin treatment including proteins related to metabolism, oxidative stress and cellular respiration. The most up-regulated protein was glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT)  an enzyme, whose deficiency was shown to be directly related to the development of NAFLD. Our results clearly point to the strong mitochondrial action of metformin in NAFLD. Up-regulation of GNMT may represent an important mechanism of beneficial action of metformin in NAFLD treatment.","Stachowicz, AnetaSuski, MaciejOlszanecki, RafałMadej, JózefOkoń, KrzysztofKorbut, Ryszard","Stachowicz ASuski MOlszanecki RMadej JOkoń KKorbut R","Chair of Pharmacology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Poland.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20120830","Netherlands","J Proteomics","Journal of proteomics","101475056","0 (Apolipoproteins E)0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)0 (Proteome)9100L32L2N (Metformin)","IMCIN  J Proteomics. 2013 Jul 11;87:132-3. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2013.01.007.

Recently, researchers have focused on studying the organs and tissues known to be involved in the development of the type 2 phenotype using a proteomic approach. Little work has been reported on plasma of type 2 diabetics in whom the clinical status has been well characterized. In this study, changes in plasma proteins of type 2 diabetics were investigated by proteomic analysis in well-characterized individuals with type 2 diabetes (early and late stage) and control groups (with or without a family history of diabetes). METHODS: Samples were analysed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and significantly differentiated proteins were identified by nano-LC-ESI-MS. RESULTS: A total of 12 protein signatures that were differentially displayed with high significance compared with controls were selected. Four of the differentially displayed proteins were identified as haptoglobin alpha2, haptoglobin Hp2(fragment) and transthyretin and Chain A (formerly prealbumin), and all were up-regulated. Thiol-specific antioxidant protein, Chain A, tertiary structures of three amyloidogenic transthretin variants and haptoglobin-related protein precursor were all down-regulated in controls with a family history of diabetes, early and late diabetic patients in comparison with the control.

Finding early biomarkers for detecting asymptomatic patients with CVD can improve survival. Recently, plasma proteomics-targeted selected reaction monitoring/multiple reaction monitoring analyses (MRM)-has emerged as highly specific and sensitive tools compared with classic ELISA methods. The objective was to identify differentially regulated proteins according to the severity of the coronary artery atherosclerosis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A discovery cohort, a verification cohort and a validation cohort consisted of 18, 53, and 228 subjects, respectively. The grade of coronary artery stenosis was defined as a percentage of luminal stenosis of the major coronary arteries. Participants were divided into six groups, depending on the presence of diabetes and the grade of coronary artery stenosis. Two mass spectrometric approaches were employed: (1) conventional shotgun liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for a discovery and (2) quantitative MRM for verification and validation. An analysis of the covariance was used to examine the biomarkers' predictivity beyond conventional cardiovascular risks. RESULTS: A total of 1349 different proteins were identified from a discovery cohort. We selected 52 proteins based on the tandem mass tag quantitative analysis then summarized as follows: chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 7 (CXCL7), apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2), human lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) in diabetes; CXCL7, APOC2, LBP, complement 4A (C4A), vitamin D-binding protein (VTDB) and laminin β1 subunit in non-diabetes. Analysis of covariance showed that APOC2, DOCK2, CXCL7 and VTDB were upregulated and C4A was downregulated in patients with diabetes showing severe coronary artery stenosis. LBP and VTDB were downregulated in patients without diabetes, showing severe coronary artery stenosis. CONCLUSION: We identified significant associations between circulating APOC2, C4A, CXCL7, DOCK2, LBP and VTDB levels and the degree of coronary artery stenosis using the MRM technique.","Ku, Eu JeongCho, Kyung-ChoLim, CheongKang, Jeong WonOh, Jae WonChoi, Yu RiPark, Jong-MoonHan, Na-YoungOh, Jong JinOh, Tae JungJang, Hak ChulLee, HookeunKim, Kwang PyoChoi, Sung Hee","Ku EJAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5533-4989Cho KCLim CKang JWOh JWChoi YRPark JMHan NYOh JJOh TJJang HCAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4188-6536Lee HKim KPChoi SHAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-0740-8116","Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University Hospital, Cheongju, South Korea.Internal Medicine, Chungbuk National University College of Medicine, Cheongju, South Korea.Applied Chemisty, Kyung Hee University College of Applied Sciences, Yongin, South Korea.Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.Applied Chemisty, Kyung Hee University College of Applied Sciences, Yongin, South Korea.Applied Chemisty, Kyung Hee University College of Applied Sciences, Yongin, South Korea.Applied Chemisty, Kyung Hee University College of Applied Sciences, Yongin, South Korea.Pharmaceutics, Gachon University College of Pharmacy, Incheon, South Korea.Pharmaceutics, Gachon University College of Pharmacy, Incheon, South Korea.Urology, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.Urology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.Pharmaceutics, Gachon University College of Pharmacy, Incheon, South Korea.Applied Chemisty, Kyung Hee University College of Applied Sciences, Yongin, South Korea shchoimd@gmail.com kimkp@khu.ac.kr.Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea shchoimd@gmail.com kimkp@khu.ac.kr.Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"England","BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care","BMJ open diabetes research & care","101641391","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","*AtherosclerosisBiomarkers*Coronary Artery Disease/diagnosisHumansProteomics","PMC7202779",NA,"NOTNLM","biomarkerscoronary artery diseaseproteomic analysistype 2 diabetes","Competing interests: None declared.","2020/04/25 06:00","2021/06/22 06:00","2020/04/22","2020/04/25 06:00","2019/12/24 00:00 [received]2020/03/04 00:00 [revised]2020/03/24 00:00 [accepted]2020/04/25 06:00 [entrez]2020/04/25 06:00 [pubmed]2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]2020/04/22 00:00 [pmc-release]","8/1/e001152 [pii]bmjdrc-2019-001152 [pii]10.1136/bmjdrc-2019-001152 [doi]","ppublish","BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care. 2020 Apr;8(1):e001152. doi: 10.1136/bmjdrc-2019-001152.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

The molecular mechanisms of metformin have not been fully identified, but turnover of biomarkers such as glucose and signalling pathways or translocation of glucose transporters are closely related to the glucose-lowering effects of metformin. The PK/PD of metformin have been investigated in healthy humans and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and modelling has been performed using an indirect response model. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The purpose of this investigation was to develop a population PK/PD model for metformin using a signal transduction model in healthy humans and predict the PK/PD profile in patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim was to compare a previous model (a biophase model) with the signal transduction model, and use a more appropriate model to follow the actions of metformin. Additionally, our developed model was appropriate to predict the time course of plasma metformin and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes. To our knowledge, this is the first published population PK/PD analysis using the signal transduction model for metformin. AIMS To develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) model for metformin (500 mg) using the signal transduction model in healthy humans and to predict the PK/PD profile in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Following the oral administration of 500 mg metformin to healthy humans, plasma concentrations of metformin were measured using LC-MS/MS. A sequential modelling approach using NONMEM VI was used to facilitate data analysis. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to predict the antihyperglycaemic effect in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Forty-two healthy humans were included in the study. Population mean estimates (relative standard error, RSE) of apparent clearance, apparent volume of distribution and the absorption rate constant were 52.6 l h(-1) (4.18%), 113 l (56.6%) and 0.41 h(-1) , respectively. Covariate analyses revealed that creatinine clearance (CL(CR) ) significantly influenced metformin: CL/F= 52.6 × (CL(cr) /106.5)(0.782) . The signal transduction model was applied to describe the antihyperglycaemic effect of metformin. The population means for efficacy, potency, transit time and the Hill coefficient were estimated to be 19.8 (3.17%), 3.68 µg ml(-1) (3.89%), 0.5 h (2.89%) and 0.547 (9.05%), respectively. The developed model was used to predict the antihyperglycaemic effect in patients with type 2 diabetes. The predicted plasma glucose concentration value was similar to previous values. CONCLUSIONS: The population signal transduction model was developed and evaluated for metformin use in healthy volunteers. Model evaluation by non-parametric bootstrap analysis suggested that the proposed model was robust and parameter values were estimated with good precision.","Chae, Jung-wooBaek, In-hwanLee, Byung-yoCho, Seong-kwonKwon, Kwang-il","Chae JWBaek IHLee BYCho SKKwon KI","College of Pharmacy, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea.","eng",NA,"Clinical TrialJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"England","Br J Clin Pharmacol","British journal of clinical pharmacology","7503323","0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)9100L32L2N (Metformin)AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)","IM","AdultBlood Glucose/drug effectsChromatography, LiquidCreatinine/blood/urineDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapyHumansHypoglycemic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacologyMaleMetformin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology*Models, BiologicalMonte Carlo MethodNonlinear DynamicsSignal Transduction/drug effectsTandem Mass SpectrometryTissue DistributionYoung Adult","PMC3495146",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2012/03/03 06:00","2013/03/07 06:00","2013/11/01","2012/03/03 06:00","2012/03/03 06:00 [entrez]2012/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]2013/03/07 06:00 [medline]2013/11/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04260.x [doi]","ppublish","Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2012 Nov;74(5):815-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2012.04260.x.","© 2012 The Authors.

This is vital since many T2D cases may be preventable by avoiding those factors that trigger the disease process (primary prevention) or by use of therapy that modulates the disease process before the onset of clinical symptoms (secondary prevention) occurs. The selection of predictive markers must be carefully assessed and depends mainly on three important parameters: sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value. Unfortunately, biomarkers with ideal specificity and sensitivity are difficult to find. One potential solution is to use the combinatorial power of different biomarkers, each of which alone may not offer satisfactory specificity and sensitivity. Recent technological advances in proteomics and bioinformatics offer a great opportunity for the discovery of different potential predictive markers. In this review, we described a cellular T2D model as an example with the intent of providing specific enrichment and new identification strategies, which might have the potential to improve predictive biomarker identification and to bring accuracy in disease diagnosis and classification, as well as therapeutic monitoring in the early phase of T2D.","Koehn, JadrankaKrapfenbauer, Kurt","Koehn JKrapfenbauer K","Department of Cranio-Maxillofacial and Oral Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20100324","Switzerland","EPMA J","The EPMA journal","101517307",NA,NA,NA,"PMC3405302",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2010/03/01 00:00","2010/03/01 00:01","2010/03/24","2012/12/04 06:00","2009/12/02 00:00 [received]2010/01/28 00:00 [accepted]2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]2010/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]2010/03/01 00:01 [medline]2010/03/24 00:00 [pmc-release]","5 [pii]10.1007/s13167-010-0005-6 [doi]","ppublish","EPMA J. 2010 Mar;1(1):19-31. doi: 10.1007/s13167-010-0005-6.

RESULTS: In brain capillaries, expression levels of BBB transporters (Glut1, P-glycoprotein) and tight-junction proteins (claudin-5, occludin) were significantly reduced in HFD mice at 2 weeks, but recovered to the levels in the normal diet (ND) group at 10 weeks. P-glycoprotein function at the BBB was reduced at 2 weeks. In the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, neurofilament, which is important for neuronal function, was decreased in HFD mice at 2 weeks, but recovered at 10 weeks. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that changes in the status of insulin resistance influence expression of BBB transporters, which in turn may alter the expression of cognitive function-related proteins.","Ogata, SeiryoIto, ShingoMasuda, TakeshiOhtsuki, Sumio","Ogata SIto SMasuda TOhtsuki SAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4634-7133","Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, 5-1 Oe-honmachi, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, 862-0973, Japan.Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, 5-1 Oe-honmachi, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, 862-0973, Japan.Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, 5-1 Oe-honmachi, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, 862-0973, Japan.AMED-CREST, Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, 1-7-1 Otemachi, Chiyoda, Tokyo, 100-0004, Japan.Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, 5-1 Oe-honmachi, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, 862-0973, Japan.Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, 5-1 Oe-honmachi, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, 862-0973, Japan.AMED-CREST, Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, 1-7-1 Otemachi, Chiyoda, Tokyo, 100-0004, Japan.Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kumamoto University, 5-1 Oe-honmachi, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, 862-0973, Japan. sohtsuki@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, 5-1 Oe-honmachi, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, 862-0973, Japan. sohtsuki@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.AMED-CREST, Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, 1-7-1 Otemachi, Chiyoda, Tokyo, 100-0004, Japan. sohtsuki@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.","eng","15H01562/Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas/","Journal Article","20190731","United States","Pharm Res","Pharmaceutical research","8406521","0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)0 (Insulin)0 (Slc2a1 protein, mouse)0 (Tight Junction Proteins)","IM","ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolismAnimalsBlood-Brain Barrier/metabolismBrain/blood supply/*metabolismCapillaries/metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/etiology/metabolismDiet, High-Fat/*adverse effectsGlucose Transporter Type 1/metabolismInsulin/*metabolism*Insulin ResistanceIntermediate Filaments/metabolismMaleMice, Inbred C57BLProteomicsTight Junction Proteins/metabolism",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","Blood-brain barriercentral nervous systeminsulin resistancequantitative proteomicstype II diabetes mellitus",NA,"2019/08/02 06:00","2019/08/21 06:00",NA,"2019/08/02 06:00","2019/05/13 00:00 [received]2019/07/20 00:00 [accepted]2019/08/02 06:00 [entrez]2019/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]2019/08/21 06:00 [medline]","10.1007/s11095-019-2674-8 [pii]10.1007/s11095-019-2674-8 [doi]","epublish","Pharm Res. 2019 Jul 31;36(10):141. doi: 10.1007/s11095-019-2674-8.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/s11095-019-2674-8",NA,2019

We established a proteomics approach for identification of diabetic nephropathy-related biomarkers in urine. METHODS: We used SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry and SAX2 protein arrays to compare protein profiles from urine of 4 defined patient groups. Samples from patients with type 2 diabetes (DM; n = 45) without nephropathy and without microalbuminuria (DM-WNP), patients with DM with macro or microalbuminuria (DM-NP; n = 38), patients with proteinuria due to nondiabetic renal disease (n = 34), and healthy controls (n = 45) were analyzed. Anionic exchange, reversed-phase fractionation, gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry were used to isolate and identify proteins with high discriminatory power. RESULTS: A protein with m/z 6188 (P <0.0000004) was strongly released in the urine of healthy controls, patients with proteinuria due to nondiabetic disease, and DM-WNP in contrast to DM-NP patients. An m/z 14 766 protein (P <0.00008) was selectively excreted in the urine of DM-NP patients, whereas the protein with m/z 11 774 (P <0.000004) was significantly excreted by patients with proteinuria and DM-NP. The m/z 11 774 and m/z 14 766 mass peaks were identified as beta(2)-microglobulin and UbA52, a ubiquitin ribosomal fusion protein, respectively. The protein with m/z 6188 was identified as a processed form of ubiquitin. CONCLUSION: The release of high amounts of UbA52 in urine of DM-NP patients could serve as a diagnostic marker, whereas the lack of the short form of ubiquitin raises interesting questions about the pathophysiology.","Dihazi, HassanMüller, Gerhard ALindner, SandraMeyer, MarkusAsif, Abdul ROellerich, MichaelStrutz, Frank","Dihazi HMüller GALindner SMeyer MAsif AROellerich MStrutz F","Department of Nephrology and Rheumatology, Georg-August-University Medical Center, Goettingen, Germany. dihazi@med.uni-goettingen.de","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20070718","England","Clin Chem","Clinical chemistry","9421549","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Proteome)0 (Ubiquitins)","IM","AgedAlbuminuria/diagnosis/urineBiomarkers/urineDiabetic Nephropathies/diagnosis/*urineFemaleHumansMaleMiddle AgedProtein Array AnalysisProteome/*analysisReproducibility of ResultsSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-IonizationUbiquitins/*urine",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2007/07/20 09:00","2007/09/29 09:00",NA,"2007/07/20 09:00","2007/07/20 09:00 [pubmed]2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]2007/07/20 09:00 [entrez]","clinchem.2007.088260 [pii]10.1373/clinchem.2007.088260 [doi]","ppublish","Clin Chem. 2007 Sep;53(9):1636-45. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2007.088260.

To better understand the recovery process of those diabetic rodents, we examined the effect of hypoglycemic dipeptide Cyclo (His-Pro) (CHP) treatment on the differential expression of pancreatic proteins in both animal models. Oral administration of CHP had an excellent hypoglycemic effect in both animal models, lowering the average plasma glucose level by over 50%. Pancreatic proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. This study allowed, for the first time, the identification of 34 proteins that are related to diabetes and potential targets of CHP, a potent anti-diabetic agent for both T1DM and T2DM. The alterations in the expression of these proteins could indicate a tendency for diabetic animals to overcome their diabetic state. These proteins are involved in cellular functions such as metabolism, cellular structure, oxidative stress, as well as signal and energy transduction. Some have already been linked to diabetes, suggesting that the newly identified proteins might also be significant in the etiology of this pathology and should be further investigated. Furthermore, CHP has emerged as a potent tool for both the treatment and study of the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetes.

METHODS AND RESULTS: To investigate sex differences in HF development and progression, we compared baseline circulating proteins (Olink Cardiovascular II panel) in males and females with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome for the outcome of HF hospitalization. Data were from the placebo-controlled Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin vs Standard of Care (EXAMINE) trial. Pathophysiological sex-differences were interpreted with network and pathway over-representation analyses. The EXAMINE trial enrolled 5380 participants (32.1% females) with biomarker data available for 95.4% of individuals. Analyses revealed 43 biomarkers were differentially expressed in HF hospitalization, of which 18 were sex specific. Among these 43 biomarkers, interleukin-6 was identified as a central node for the pathogenesis of HF hospitalization in both females and in males. Additional pathway over-representation analyses demonstrated that biomarkers associated with inflammatory pathways related to endothelial dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis were more up-regulated in females than males with HF hospitalization. Differential expression of 3 biomarkers (pentraxin-related protein 3, hydroxyacid oxidase 1, and carbonic anhydrase 5A) was independently associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalization in females but not in males (interaction P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: In males and females with type 2 diabetes and acute coronary syndrome, interleukin-6 seems to be central in the pathogenesis of HF. Females exhibit higher levels of circulating proteins related to immunological pathways, reflecting sex-specific differences underlying HF development and progression.","Razaghizad, AmirAziz, HayaZhang, Guang KFerreira, João PedroWhite, William BMehta, Cyrus RBakris, George LZannad, FaiezSharma, Abhinav","Razaghizad AAziz HZhang GKFerreira JPWhite WBMehta CRBakris GLZannad FSharma A","Centre for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Division of Cardiology, McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; DREAM-CV Lab, McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.DREAM-CV Lab, McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.Centre for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.Inserm, Centre d'Investigation Clinique Plurithématique 1433, CHRU de Nancy, F-CRIN INI-CRCT, Université de Lorraine, Nancy, France; Department of Surgery and Physiology, Cardiovascular R&D Centre  UnIC@RISE, Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.Cardiology Center, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut.Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts.University of Chicago School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.Inserm, Centre d'Investigation Clinique Plurithématique 1433, CHRU de Nancy, F-CRIN INI-CRCT, Université de Lorraine, Nancy, France.Centre for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Division of Cardiology, McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; DREAM-CV Lab, McGill University Health Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are a population with a worse prognosis and higher mortality risk compared to coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. However, the value of ceramides for risk prediction in PAD patients is still vague, as addressed in the present study. (2)Methods: This observational study included 379 PAD patients. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 10 years of follow-up. A set of ceramides was measured by LC-MS/MS and combined according to the Coronary Event Risk Test (CERT) score, which categorizes patients into one of four risk groups (low risk, moderate risk, high risk, very high risk). (3) Results: Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that the overall survival of patients decreased with the increasing risk predicted by the four CERT categories, advancing from low risk to very high risk. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that each one-category increase resulted in a 35% rise in overall mortality risk (HR = 1.35 [1.16-1.58]). Multivariable adjustment, including, among others, age, LDL-cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, and statin treatment before the baseline, did not abrogate this significant association (HR = 1.22 [1.04-1.43]). Moreover, we found that the beneficial effect of statin treatment is significantly stronger in patients with a higher risk, according to CERT. (4) Conclusions: We conclude that the ceramide-based risk score CERT is a strong predictor of the 10-year mortality risk in patients with PAD.","Leiherer, AndreasMuendlein, AxelSaely, Christoph HGeiger, KathrinBrandtner, Eva-MariaHeinzle, ChristineGaenger, StellaMink, SylviaLaaksonen, ReijoFraunberger, PeterDrexel, Heinz","Leiherer AAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3776-5704Muendlein AAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5582-4125Saely CHGeiger KBrandtner EMHeinzle CGaenger SMink SLaaksonen RFraunberger PDrexel HAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4677-9756","Vorarlberg Institute for Vascular Investigation and Treatment (VIVIT), Academic Teaching Hospital Feldkirch, Carinagasse 47, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Private University of the Principality of Liechtenstein, FL-9495 Triesen, Liechtenstein.Medical Central Laboratories, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Vorarlberg Institute for Vascular Investigation and Treatment (VIVIT), Academic Teaching Hospital Feldkirch, Carinagasse 47, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Private University of the Principality of Liechtenstein, FL-9495 Triesen, Liechtenstein.Vorarlberg Institute for Vascular Investigation and Treatment (VIVIT), Academic Teaching Hospital Feldkirch, Carinagasse 47, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Private University of the Principality of Liechtenstein, FL-9495 Triesen, Liechtenstein.Department of Internal Medicine III, Academic Teaching Hospital Feldkirch, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Vorarlberg Institute for Vascular Investigation and Treatment (VIVIT), Academic Teaching Hospital Feldkirch, Carinagasse 47, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Medical Central Laboratories, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Vorarlberg Institute for Vascular Investigation and Treatment (VIVIT), Academic Teaching Hospital Feldkirch, Carinagasse 47, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Vorarlberg Institute for Vascular Investigation and Treatment (VIVIT), Academic Teaching Hospital Feldkirch, Carinagasse 47, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Medical Central Laboratories, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Vorarlberg Institute for Vascular Investigation and Treatment (VIVIT), Academic Teaching Hospital Feldkirch, Carinagasse 47, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Private University of the Principality of Liechtenstein, FL-9495 Triesen, Liechtenstein.Medical Central Laboratories, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Finnish Cardiovascular Research Center, University of Tampere, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland.Zora Biosciences, FI-02150 Espoo, Finland.Private University of the Principality of Liechtenstein, FL-9495 Triesen, Liechtenstein.Medical Central Laboratories, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Vorarlberg Institute for Vascular Investigation and Treatment (VIVIT), Academic Teaching Hospital Feldkirch, Carinagasse 47, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Private University of the Principality of Liechtenstein, FL-9495 Triesen, Liechtenstein.Vorarlberger Landeskrankenhausbetriebsgesellschaft, Academic Teaching Hospital Feldkirch, A-6800 Feldkirch, Austria.Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19129, USA.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20230923","Switzerland","J Clin Med","Journal of clinical medicine","101606588",NA,NA,NA,"PMC10573503",NA,"NOTNLM","CERTMACEbiomarkerceramidesmortalityperipheral artery diseaserisk factorsstatin","A.L. has nothing to disclose.

RESULTS: In this work, human serum of non-diabetic and diabetic cohorts was analyzed by proteomic approach. To analyze total 1377 high-confident serum-proteins, we developed a computing strategy called localized statistics of protein abundance distribution (LSPAD) to calculate a significant bias of a particular protein-abundance between these two cohorts. As a result, 68 proteins were found significantly over-represented in the diabetic serum (p<0.01). In addition, a pathway-associated analysis was developed to obtain the overall pathway bias associated with type 2 diabetes, from which the significant over-representation of complement system associated with type 2 diabetes was uncovered. Moreover, an up-stream activator of complement pathway, ficolin-3, was observed over-represented in the serum of type 2 diabetic patients, which was further validated with statistic significance (p = 0.012) with more clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: The developed LSPAD approach is well fit for analyzing proteomic data derived from biological complex systems such as plasma proteome. With LSPAD, we disclosed the comprehensive distribution of the proteins associated with diabetes in different abundance levels and the involvement of ficolin-related complement activation in diabetes.","Li, Rong-XiaChen, Hai-BingTu, KangZhao, Shi-LinZhou, HuLi, Su-JunDai, JieLi, Qing-RunNie, SongLi, Yi-XueJia, Wei-PingZeng, RongWu, Jia-Rui","Li RXChen HBTu KZhao SLZhou HLi SJDai JLi QRNie SLi YXJia WPZeng RWu JR","Key Laboratory of Systems Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20080916","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Proteins)0 (Lectins)","IM","AgedBiomarkersBlood Proteins/*chemistryCohort StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/*metabolismDisease ProgressionElectrophoresis, Agar Gel/methodsHumansLectins/biosynthesisMaleMiddle AgedModels, StatisticalProteomics/*methodsReproducibility of ResultsFicolins","PMC2529402",NA,NA,NA,"Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2008/09/17 09:00","2008/12/17 09:00","2008/09/16","2008/09/17 09:00","2008/05/09 00:00 [received]2008/08/11 00:00 [accepted]2008/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]2008/09/17 09:00 [entrez]2008/09/16 00:00 [pmc-release]","08-PONE-RA-04659R1 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0003224 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2008 Sep 16;3(9):e3224. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0003224.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0003224",NA,2008

Here, we aimed to characterize the previously undefined role of disrupted AdipoR1 signaling on the mitochondrial protein composition of cardiac, renal, and hepatic tissues as three organs principally associated with diabetic complications. Comparative proteomics were performed in mitochondria isolated from the heart, kidneys and liver of Adipor1 (-/-) mice. A total of 790, 1,573, and 1,833 proteins were identified in cardiac, renal and hepatic mitochondria, respectively. While 121, 98, and 78 proteins were differentially regulated in cardiac, renal, and hepatic tissue of Adipor1(-/-) mice, respectively; only 15 proteins were regulated in the same direction across all investigated tissues. Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins revealed disproportionate representation of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation conserved across tissue types. Curated pathway analysis identified HNF4, NRF1, LONP, RICTOR, SURF1, insulin receptor, and PGC-1α as candidate upstream regulators. In high fat-fed non-transgenic mice with obesity and insulin resistance, AdipoR1 gene expression was markedly reduced in heart (-70%), kidney (-80%), and liver (-90%) (all P < 0.05) as compared to low fat-fed mice. NRF1 was the only upstream regulator downregulated both in Adipor1(-/-) mice and in high fat-fed mice, suggesting common mechanisms of regulation. Thus, AdipoR1 signaling regulates mitochondrial protein composition across all investigated tissues in a functionally conserved, yet molecularly distinct, manner. The biological significance and potential implications of impaired AdipoR1 signaling are discussed.","Pepin, Mark EKoentges, ChristophPfeil, KatharinaGollmer, JohannesKersting, SophiaWiese, SebastianHoffmann, Michael MOdening, Katja Evon Zur Mühlen, ConstantinDiehl, PhilippStachon, PeterWolf, DennisWende, Adam RBode, ChristophZirlik, AndreasBugger, Heiko","Pepin MEKoentges CPfeil KGollmer JKersting SWiese SHoffmann MMOdening KEvon Zur Mühlen CDiehl PStachon PWolf DWende ARBode CZirlik ABugger H","Division of Molecular and Cellular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.Division of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Freiburg, Germany.Division of Cardiology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.Division of Cardiology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.Division of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Freiburg, Germany.Core Unit Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.Institute for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.Division of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Freiburg, Germany.Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.Division of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Freiburg, Germany.Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.Division of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Freiburg, Germany.Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.Division of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Freiburg, Germany.Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.Division of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Freiburg, Germany.Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.Division of Molecular and Cellular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.Division of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Freiburg, Germany.Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.Division of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Freiburg, Germany.Division of Cardiology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.Division of Cardiology and Angiology I, Heart Center Freiburg University, Freiburg, Germany.Division of Cardiology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.","eng","P30 DK079626/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States","Journal Article","20191213","Switzerland","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Frontiers in endocrinology","101555782",NA,NA,NA,"PMC6923683",NA,"NOTNLM","adiponectinadiponectin receptordiabetesheartmitochondriaproteome",NA,"2020/01/11 06:00","2020/01/11 06:01","2019/01/01","2020/01/11 06:00","2019/07/09 00:00 [received]2019/11/28 00:00 [accepted]2020/01/11 06:00 [entrez]2020/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]2020/01/11 06:01 [medline]2019/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.3389/fendo.2019.00872 [doi]","epublish","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2019 Dec 13;10:872. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2019.00872. eCollection 2019.","Copyright © 2019 Pepin, Koentges, Pfeil, Gollmer, Kersting, Wiese, Hoffmann, Odening, Mühlen, Diehl, Stachon, Wolf, Wende, Bode, Zirlik and Bugger.",NA,NA,"10.3389/fendo.2019.00872",NA,2019

However, the biological mechanism responsible for key metabolic disorders in the PAT of rabbits subject to HFD remains unclear. Here, untargeted metabolomics (LC-MS/MS) combined with liquid chromatography (LC) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) were used to evaluate PAT metabolic changes. Histological observations showed that the adipocytes cells and density of PAT were significantly increased in HFD rabbits. Our study revealed 206 differential metabolites (21 up-regulated and 185 down-regulated); 47 differential metabolites (13 up-regulated and 34 down-regulated), comprising mainly phospholipids, fatty acids, steroid hormones and amino acids, were chosen as potential biomarkers to help explain metabolic disorders caused by HFD. These metabolites were mainly associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway, the ovarian steroidogenesis pathway, and the platelet activation pathway. Our study revealed that a HFD caused significant lipometabolic disorders. These metabolites may inhibit oxygen respiration by increasing the adipocytes cells and density, cause mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, produce inflammation, and finally lead to insulin resistance, thus increasing the risk of Type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and other metabolic syndromes.","Xia, SiqiShao, JiahaoElzo, Mauricio ATang, TaoLi, YanhongLai, TianfuGan, MingchuanMa, YuanJia, XianboLai, SongjiaWang, Jie","Xia SShao JElzo MATang TLi YLai TGan MMa YJia XAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6885-4104Lai SWang J","College of Animal Science and Technology, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.College of Animal Science and Technology, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.Department of Animal Science, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.College of Animal Science and Technology, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.College of Animal Science and Technology, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.College of Animal Science and Technology, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.College of Animal Science and Technology, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.College of Animal Science and Technology, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.Farm Animal Genetic Resources Exploration and Innovation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.","eng","2021YFYZ0033/Key Research and Development Program of Sichuan Province/","Journal Article","20210803","Switzerland","Animals (Basel)","Animals : an open access journal from MDPI","101635614",NA,NA,NA,"PMC8388361",NA,"NOTNLM","high-fat dietlipometabolicmetabolomicsperirenal adipose tissue (PAT)rabbit","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","2021/08/28 06:00","2021/08/28 06:01","2021/08/03","2021/08/27 01:01","2021/06/29 00:00 [received]2021/07/29 00:00 [revised]2021/07/30 00:00 [accepted]2021/08/27 01:01 [entrez]2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]2021/08/28 06:01 [medline]2021/08/03 00:00 [pmc-release]","ani11082289 [pii]animals-11-02289 [pii]10.3390/ani11082289 [doi]","epublish","Animals (Basel). 2021 Aug 3;11(8):2289. doi: 10.3390/ani11082289.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/ani11082289",NA,2021

Acylcarnitines, fatty acid metabolites, have been associated with type 2 diabetes risk in cross-sectional studies of mostly Caucasian subjects, but prospective studies on their link to prediabetes in diverse populations are lacking. Here, we determined the association of plasma acylcarnitines with incident prediabetes in African Americans and European Americans enrolled in a prospective study. We analyzed 45 acylcarnitines in baseline plasma samples from 70 adults (35 African-American, 35 European-American) with incident prediabetes (progressors) and 70 matched controls (non-progressors) during 5.5-year (mean 2.6 years) follow-up in the Pathobiology of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort (POP-ABC) study. Incident prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose/impaired glucose tolerance) was confirmed with OGTT. We measured acylcarnitines using tandem mass spectrometry, insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, and insulin secretion using intravenous glucose tolerance test. The results showed that progressors and non-progressors during POP-ABC study follow-up were concordant for 36 acylcarnitines and discordant for nine others. In logistic regression models, beta-hydroxy butyryl carnitine (C4-OH), 3-hydroxy-isovaleryl carnitine/malonyl carnitine (C5-OH/C3-DC), and octenoyl carnitine (C8:1) were the only significant predictors of incident prediabetes. The combined cut-off plasma levels of <0.03 micromol/L for C4-OH, <0.03 micromol/L for C5-OH/C3-DC, and >0.25 micromol/L for C8:1 acylcarnitines predicted incident prediabetes with 81.9% sensitivity and 65.2% specificity. Thus, circulating levels of one medium-chain and two short-chain acylcarnitines may be sensitive biomarkers for the risk of incident prediabetes among initially normoglycemic individuals with parental history of type 2 diabetes.","Owei, IbiyeUmekwe, NkiruStentz, FrankieWan, JimDagogo-Jack, Sam","Owei IUmekwe NStentz FWan JDagogo-Jack SAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5318-9677","Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.","eng","R01 DK067269/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20210429","Switzerland","Exp Biol Med (Maywood)","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)","100973463","0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Insulins)0 (acylcarnitine)S7UI8SM58A (Carnitine)","IM","AdultBlood Glucose/*analysisCarnitine/*analogs & derivatives/bloodCross-Sectional StudiesGlucose Intolerance/*etiologyHumansInsulin Resistance/*physiologyInsulin Secretion/*physiologyInsulins/metabolismMaleMiddle AgedPrediabetic State/blood","PMC8719045",NA,"NOTNLM","Fatty acidsimpaired fasting glucoseimpaired glucose toleranceinsulin sensitivitymetabolitesoctenoyl carnitinerace/ethnicity","DECLARATION OF CONFLICTING INTERESTS: The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.","2021/05/01 06:00","2021/11/27 06:00","2022/02/01","2021/04/30 05:33","2021/05/01 06:00 [pubmed]2021/11/27 06:00 [medline]2021/04/30 05:33 [entrez]2022/02/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1177_15353702211009493 [pii]10.1177/15353702211009493 [doi]","ppublish","Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2021 Aug;246(15):1698-1705. doi: 10.1177/15353702211009493.

Utilizing integrative proteomic analysis, this study aimed to identify a panel of potential protein markers for T2DM, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and paving the way for personalized treatment strategies. METHODS: Proteome profiles from two independent cohorts were integrated: cohort 1 composed of 10 T2DM patients and 10 healthy controls (HC), and cohort 2 comprising 87 T2DM patients and 60 healthy controls. Differential expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and classification error matrix analysis were employed. RESULTS: Comparative proteomic analysis identified the differential expressed proteins (DEPs) and changes in biological pathways associated with T2DM. Further combined analysis refined a group of protein panel (including CA1, S100A6, and DDT), which were significantly increased in T2DM in both two cohorts. ROC analysis revealed the area under curve (AUC) values of 0.94 for CA1, 0.87 for S100A6, and 0.97 for DDT; the combined model achieved an AUC reaching 1. Classification error matrix analysis demonstrated the combined model could reach an accuracy of 1 and 0.875 in the 60% training set and 40% testing set. CONCLUSIONS: This study incorporates different cohorts of T2DM, and refines the potential markers for T2DM with high accuracy, offering more reliable markers for clinical translation.

This study investigated the site-specific reaction of glyoxal and methylglyoxal with the amino acid residues on human hemoglobin using a shot-gun proteomic approach with nanoflow liquid chromatography/nanospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS). In human hemoglobin incubated with glyoxal, modification on 8 different sites, including lysine residues at α-Lys-11, α-Lys-16, α-Lys-56, β-Lys-17, β-Lys-66, β-Lys-144, and arginine residues at α-Arg-92 and β-Arg-30, was observed using a data-dependent scan. In methylglyoxal-treated hemoglobin, there were specific residues, namely, α-Arg-92, β-Lys-66, β-Arg-30, and β-Lys-144, forming carboxyethylation as well as the dehydrated product hydroimidazolone at α-Arg-92 and β-Arg-30. These lysine and arginine modifications were confirmed by accurate mass measurement and the MS(2) and MS(3) spectra. The most intensive signal of each modified peptide was used as the precursor ion to perform the product ion scan. The relative extent of modifications was semiquantified simultaneously relative to the native reference peptide by nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS under the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The extent of these modifications increased dose-dependently with increasing concentrations of glyoxal or methylglyoxal. Six out of the eight modifications induced by glyoxal and three out of the six modifications induced by methylglyoxal were detected in hemoglobin freshly isolated from human blood samples. The relative extent of modification of these post-translational modifications was quantified in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (n = 20) and in nondiabetic control subjects (n = 21). The results show that the carboxymethylated peptides at α-Lys-16, α-Arg-92, β-Lys-17, β-Lys-66, and the peptide at α-Arg-92 with methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone are significantly higher in diabetic patients than in normal individuals (p value <0.05). This report identified and quantified glyoxal and methylglyoxal-modified hemoglobin peptides in humans and revealed the association of the extent of modifications at specific sites with T2DM. Only one drop (10 μL) of fresh blood is needed for this assay, and only an equivalent of 1 μg of hemoglobin was analyzed by the nanoLC-NSI/MS/MS-SRM system. These results suggest the potential use of these specific post-translational modifications in hemoglobin as feasible biomarker candidates to assess protein damage induced by glyoxal and methylglyoxal.","Chen, Hauh-Jyun CandyChen, Yu-ChinHsiao, Chiung-FongChen, Pin-Fan","Chen HJChen YCHsiao CFChen PF","Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Chung Cheng University , 168 University Road, Ming-Hsiung, Chia-Yi 62142, Taiwan.Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Chung Cheng University , 168 University Road, Ming-Hsiung, Chia-Yi 62142, Taiwan.Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, National Chung Cheng University , 168 University Road, Ming-Hsiung, Chia-Yi 62142, Taiwan.Buddhist Dalin Tzu Chi General Hospital , No.2, Minsheng Road, Dalin, Chia-Yi 622, Taiwan.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20151110","United States","Chem Res Toxicol","Chemical research in toxicology","8807448","0 (Hemoglobins)0 (Peptides)50NP6JJ975 (Glyoxal)722KLD7415 (Pyruvaldehyde)","IM","*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2FemaleGlyoxal/chemistry/*toxicityHemoglobins/*chemistry/*drug effectsHumansMaleMiddle AgedPeptides/analysis/bloodPyruvaldehyde/chemistry/*toxicityReference StandardsSmokingSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015/10/31 06:00","2016/08/09 06:00",NA,"2015/10/31 06:00","2015/10/31 06:00 [entrez]2015/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]2016/08/09 06:00 [medline]","10.1021/acs.chemrestox.5b00380 [doi]","ppublish","Chem Res Toxicol. 2015 Dec 21;28(12):2377-89. doi: 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.5b00380.

Serum from persons with NGT and persons with T2DM was profiled using ProteinChip arrays and time-of-flight mass spectra were generated by surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS). RESULTS: Mass spectra from NGT and T2DM-groups were compared. Fifteen proteins ranging from 5 to 79 kDa were differentially expressed (p < 0.05). Five of these proteins showed decreased and ten showed increased serum levels in individuals with T2DM. To be able to identify the proteins, the complexity of the sample was reduced by fractionation approaches. Subsequently, the purified fractions containing biomarkers were separated by one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in two identical lanes. Protein bands of the first lane were excised and subjected to passive elution to recapture the biomarkers on ProteinChip arrays. The corresponding bands of the second lane were subjected to peptide-mass fingerprinting (PMF). Using this approach four of the differentially expressed proteins were identified as apolipoprotein C3 (9.4 kDa), transthyretin (13.9 kDa), albumin (66 kDa) and transferrin (79 kDa). Whereas apolipoprotein C3 and transthyretin were up-regulated, albumin and transferrin were down-regulated in T2DM. CONCLUSION: Protocols for protein profiling by SELDI-TOF MS and protein identification by fractionation, SDS-PAGE and PMF were optimized for serum from humans with T2DM. With these protocols differentially expressed proteins were discovered and identified when serum from NGT and T2DM-individuals was analyzed.","Sundsten, TeaEberhardson, MichaelGöransson, MichaelBergsten, Peter","Sundsten TEberhardson MGöransson MBergsten P","Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. tea.sundsten@mcb.uu.se","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20061212","England","Proteome Sci","Proteome science","101170539",NA,NA,NA,"PMC1716156",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2006/12/14 09:00","2006/12/14 09:01","2006/12/12","2006/12/14 09:00","2006/08/10 00:00 [received]2006/12/12 00:00 [accepted]2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]2006/12/14 09:01 [medline]2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]2006/12/12 00:00 [pmc-release]","1477-5956-4-22 [pii]10.1186/1477-5956-4-22 [doi]","epublish","Proteome Sci. 2006 Dec 12;4:22. doi: 10.1186/1477-5956-4-22.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2006

Declining and even insufficient insulin levels were observed in obese adolescents with high levels of the fatty acid. In isolated human islets exposed to palmitate we have observed insulin hypersecretion after 2 days exposure. In contrast, insulin secretion from the islets was reduced after 7 days culture in the presence of the fatty acid. This study aims at identifying islet-related biological events potentially linked with the observed insulin hypersecretion and later secretory decline in these obese children and adolescents using the islet model. We analyzed protein expression data obtained from human islets exposed to elevated palmitate levels for 2 and 7 days by an improved methodology for statistical analysis of differentially expressed proteins. Protein profiling of islet samples by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified 115 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Several DEPs including sorcin were associated with increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets after 2 days of exposure to palmitate. Similarly, several metabolic pathways including altered protein degradation, increased autophagy, altered redox condition, and hampered insulin processing were coupled to the functional impairment of islets after 7 days of culture in the presence of palmitate. Such biological events, once validated in the islets, may give rise to novel treatment strategies aiming at normalizing insulin levels in obese children with high palmitate levels, which may reduce or even prevent obesity-related type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Groebe, KarlfriedCen, JingSchvartz, DomitilleSargsyan, ErnestChowdhury, AzazulRoomp, KirstenSchneider, ReinhardAlderborn, AndersSanchez, Jean-CharlesBergsten, Peter","Groebe KAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8155-8126Cen JAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6014-3984Schvartz DSargsyan EChowdhury ARoomp KSchneider RAlderborn ASanchez JCBergsten P","Pivot Biomed Science GmbH , 54296 Trier , Germany.Department of Medical Cell Biology , Uppsala University , 75236 Uppsala , Sweden.Human Protein Sciences Department, Centre Medical Universitaire , University of Geneva , CH-1211 Geneva , Switzerland.Department of Medical Cell Biology , Uppsala University , 75236 Uppsala , Sweden.Department of Medical Cell Biology , Uppsala University , 75236 Uppsala , Sweden.Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine , University of Luxembourg , 4365 Esch-sur-Alzette , Luxembourg.Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine , University of Luxembourg , 4365 Esch-sur-Alzette , Luxembourg.Department of Medical Cell Biology , Uppsala University , 75236 Uppsala , Sweden.Human Protein Sciences Department, Centre Medical Universitaire , University of Geneva , CH-1211 Geneva , Switzerland.Department of Medical Cell Biology , Uppsala University , 75236 Uppsala , Sweden.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20181003","United States","J Proteome Res","Journal of proteome research","101128775","0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)0 (SRI protein, human)2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)",NA,"AdolescentAutophagy/drug effects/geneticsCalcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolismChildChromatography, LiquidComputational Biology/methodsDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/etiology/*genetics/metabolism/pathologyFastingGene Expression ProfilingGene Expression RegulationGlucose/metabolism/pharmacologyHumansInsulin Secretion/*drug effects/geneticsInsulin-Secreting Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathologyIslets of Langerhans/*drug effects/metabolism/pathologyMaleObesity/complications/*genetics/metabolism/pathologyPalmitic Acid/metabolism/*pharmacologyProteolysisProteomics/methodsTandem Mass SpectrometryTissue Culture Techniques",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","GSIST2DMbioinformatic analysischildhood obesitydifferential proteomic analysisglucose-stimulated insulin secretionhuman pancreatic isletsin vitroinsulin hypersecretioninsulin hyposecretioninsulin secretionpalmitateproteomicstype 2 diabetes mellitus",NA,"2018/09/06 06:00","2019/08/01 06:00",NA,"2018/09/06 06:00","2018/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]2019/08/01 06:00 [medline]2018/09/06 06:00 [entrez]","10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00239 [doi]","ppublish","J Proteome Res. 2018 Nov 2;17(11):3824-3836. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00239.

We sought to test the hypothesis that circulating BCAA, aromatic AA and related AA metabolites decline in response to the use of insulin sensitizing agents in overweight/obese adults with impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo, controlled study conducted in twenty five overweight/obese (BMI ~30kg/m(2)) adults with impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes. Participants were randomized to three months of pioglitazone (45mg per day) plus metformin (1000mg twice per day, N=12 participants) or placebo (N=13). We measured insulin sensitivity by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and fasting concentrations of AA and AA metabolites using ultra-pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry before and after the three-month intervention. RESULTS: Insulin sensitizer therapy that significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity reduced 9 out of 33 AA and AA metabolites measured compared to placebo treatment. Moreover, insulin sensitizer therapy significantly reduced three functionally clustered AA and metabolite pairs: i) phenylalanine/tyrosine, ii) citrulline/arginine, and iii) lysine/α-aminoadipic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in plasma concentrations of several AA and AA metabolites in response to three months of insulin sensitizer therapy support the concept that reduced insulin sensitivity alters AA and AA metabolites.","Irving, Brian ACarter, Rickey ESoop, MattiasWeymiller, AudreySyed, HusnainKarakelides, HelenBhagra, SumitShort, Kevin RTatpati, LauraBarazzoni, RoccoNair, K Sreekumaran","Irving BACarter RESoop MWeymiller ASyed HKarakelides HBhagra SShort KRTatpati LBarazzoni RNair KS","Division of Endocrinology, Endocrinology Research Unit, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN.

However, human lipidomic studies have been inconsistent, owing to the use of indirect proxy measures of metabolic outcomes and relatively limited coverage of the lipidome. Here, we employed comprehensive lipid profiling and gold-standard metabolic measures to test the hypothesis that distinct lipid signatures in obesity may signify early stages of pathogenesis toward type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, we profiled >450 lipid species across 26 classes in 65 overweight or obese non-diabetic individuals. Intensive metabolic testing was conducted using direct gold-standard measures of adiposity (% body fat by dual X-ray absorptiometry), insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps), and insulin secretion (intravenous glucose tolerance tests), as well as measurement of serum inflammatory cytokines and adipokines (multiplex assays; flow cytometry). Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were computed using Matlab R2011a, and all analyses were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. RESULTS: We present new evidence showing a strong and independent positive correlation between the lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) lipid class and insulin secretion in vivo in humans (β [95% CI] = 781.9 [353.3, 1210.4], p = 0.01), supporting the insulinotropic effects of LPI demonstrated in mouse islets. Dihydroceramide, a sphingolipid precursor, was independently and negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity (β [95% CI] = -1.9 [-2.9, -0.9], p = 0.01), indicating a possible upregulation in sphingolipid synthesis in obese individuals. These associations remained significant in multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, and % body fat. The dihexosylceramide class correlated positively with interleukin-10 before and after adjustment for age, sex, and % body fat (p = 0.02), while the phosphatidylethanolamine class and its vinyl ether-linked (plasmalogen) derivatives correlated negatively with % body fat in both univariable and age and sex-adjusted models (all p < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that these lipid classes may signify early pathogenesis toward type 2 diabetes and could serve as novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers for diabetes prevention.","Mousa, AyaNaderpoor, NegarMellett, NatalieWilson, KirstyPlebanski, MagdalenaMeikle, Peter Jde Courten, Barbora","Mousa ANaderpoor NMellett NWilson KPlebanski MMeikle PJde Courten B","Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation (MCHRI), School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, 43-51 Kanooka Grove, Clayton, VIC 3168, Australia.

In order to elucidate the pathophysiological processes leading to type 2 diabetes, we aimed to identify protein biomarkers associated with prediabetes. METHODS: In a proteomics study, we used targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM)-MS to quantify 23 candidate proteins in the plasma of 439 randomly selected men and women aged 47-76 years from the population-based German KORA F4 study. Cross-sectional associations of protein levels with prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance), type 2 diabetes, glucose levels in both the fasting state and 2 h after an OGTT, fasting insulin and insulin resistance were investigated using regression models adjusted for technical covariables, age, sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol intake, physical inactivity, actual hypertension, triacylglycerol levels, total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. RESULTS: Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase 1 (MASP1; OR per SD 1.77 [95% CI 1.26, 2.47]), thrombospondin 1 (THBS1; OR per SD 1.55 [95% CI 1.16, 2.07]) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D1 (GPLD1; OR per SD 1.40 [95% CI 1.01, 1.94]) were positively associated with prediabetes, and apolipoprotein A-IV (ApoA-IV; OR per SD 0.75 [95% CI 0.56, 1.00]) was inversely associated with prediabetes. MASP1 was positively associated with fasting and 2 h glucose levels. ApoA-IV was inversely and THBS1 was positively associated with 2 h glucose levels. MASP1 associations with prediabetes and fasting glucose resisted Bonferroni correction. Type 2 diabetes associations were partly influenced by glucose-lowering medication. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We discovered novel and independent associations of prediabetes and related traits with MASP1, and some evidence for associations with THBS1, GPLD1 and ApoA-IV, suggesting a role for these proteins in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.","von Toerne, ChristineHuth, Corneliade Las Heras Gala, ToniaKronenberg, FlorianHerder, ChristianKoenig, WolfgangMeisinger, ChristaRathmann, WolfgangWaldenberger, MelanieRoden, MichaelPeters, AnnetteThorand, BarbaraHauck, Stefanie M","von Toerne CHuth Cde Las Heras Gala TKronenberg FHerder CKoenig WMeisinger CRathmann WWaldenberger MRoden MPeters AThorand BHauck SM","Research Unit Protein Science, Helmholtz Zentrum München-German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Ingolstaedter Landstraße 1, D-85764, München, Germany. vontoerne@helmholtz-muenchen.de.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany. vontoerne@helmholtz-muenchen.de.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology II, Helmholtz Zentrum München-German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology II, Helmholtz Zentrum München-German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Division of Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Medical Genetics, Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Clinical Diabetology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.Department of Internal Medicine II  Cardiology, University of Ulm Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.Deutsches Herzzentrum München, Technische Universität München, München, Germany.German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Munich Heart Alliance, München, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology II, Helmholtz Zentrum München-German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.MONICA/KORA Myocardial Infarction Registry, Central Hospital of Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Biometrics and Epidemiology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology II, Helmholtz Zentrum München-German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Research Unit of Molecular Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München-German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Clinical Diabetology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.Department of Endocrinology and Diabetology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology II, Helmholtz Zentrum München-German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology II, Helmholtz Zentrum München-German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Research Unit Protein Science, Helmholtz Zentrum München-German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Ingolstaedter Landstraße 1, D-85764, München, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), München-Neuherberg, Germany.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20160625","Germany","Diabetologia","Diabetologia","0006777","0 (Apolipoproteins A)0 (Biomarkers)0 (Thrombospondins)0 (apolipoprotein A-IV)0 (thrombospondin 2)EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)EC 3.1.4.50 (glycoprotein phospholipase D)EC 3.4.21.

Here we performed 2D-DIGE followed by MALDI TOF/TOF analysis to identify proteins that are differentially expressed in liver of pups born to mothers fed vitamin B12 deficient diet vis-à-vis control diet. To further establish causality, we analyzed the effect of B12 rehabilitation at parturition on the protein levels and the phenotype in pups. We identified 38 differentially expressed proteins that were enriched in pathways involved in the regulation of amino acid, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Further, three enzymes in the β-oxidation pathway (hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, medium-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase) were down-regulated in pups born to mothers fed vitamin B12 deficient diet. We observed age-dependent differential expression of peroxisome proliferator activated-receptor (PPAR) α and γ in the deficient pups. Interestingly, expression of 27 proteins that were differentially expressed was restored to the control levels after rehabilitation of female rats with vitamin B12 from parturition. Our study thus provides the first evidence that maternal vitamin B12 deficiency influences lipid and other micronutrient metabolism in pups through regulation of PPAR signaling pathway. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Maternal vitamin B12 deficiency has been shown to predict the onset of complex disorders like atherosclerosis, type II diabetes etc. in the next generation during their adulthood. We have shown earlier that pups born to female rats fed with vitamin B12 deficient diet were obese and developed high levels of other intermediate traits such as triglycerides, cholesterol etc. that are related to the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. In this piece of work using differential proteomic approach we have identified the altered metabolic processes in the liver of vitamin B12 deficient pups. We have also documented that the proteins involved in β-oxidation pathway are down-regulated. Further, differential expression of PPARα and PPARγ was evidently documented as the master regulator for the alteration of lipid, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism during maternal vitamin B12 deficiency.","Ahmad, ShadabKumar, K AnandBasak, TrayambakBhardwaj, GouravYadav, Dilip KLalitha, AChandak, Giriraj RatanRaghunath, ManchalaSengupta, Shantanu","Ahmad SKumar KABasak TBhardwaj GYadav DKLalitha AChandak GRRaghunath MSengupta S","CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi, India.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20130806","Netherlands","J Proteomics","Journal of proteomics","101475056","0 (Amino Acids)0 (Carbohydrates)0 (Lipids)0 (Micronutrients)0 (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors)0 (Proteome)P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)","IM","Amino Acids/chemistryAnimalsAnimals, NewbornCarbohydrates/chemistryFemaleGene Expression ProfilingGene Expression RegulationLipids/chemistryLiver/*metabolismMaternal ExposureMicronutrientsPeroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors/*metabolismPregnancyProteome/*metabolismProteomicsRats*Signal TransductionVitamin B 12/*metabolismVitamin B 12 Deficiency/metabolism",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","2-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis2D-DIGE3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolaseACADMACNALPBVADIADTTECLEDTAFABPLFASFDRFFMHCDHHRPIAAIDVIEFIPGLBMLiver proteomeMALDI TOF/TOFMicronutrient deficiencyNBT-BCIPObesityPPARPPARsPVDFS-adenosyl methionineSAMTFATGTHIMVitamin B(12)acetonitrilealkaline phosphatasebiological variant analysisdifferential in-gel analysisdithiotheritolenhanced chemiluminescenceethylenediaminetetraacetic acidfalse discovery ratefat free massfatty acid binding protein, liverfatty acid synthasehorseradish peroxidasehydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenaseimmobilized pH gradientintegrated density valueiodoacetamideisoelectric focussinglean body massmatrix assisted lased desorption ionization, time of flightmedium-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenasenitro blue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphateperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorpolyvinylidene fluoridetrifluroacetic acidtriglyceride",NA,"2013/08/10 06:00","2014/10/13 06:00",NA,"2013/08/10 06:00","2013/04/26 00:00 [received]2013/07/22 00:00 [revised]2013/07/26 00:00 [accepted]2013/08/10 06:00 [entrez]2013/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]2014/10/13 06:00 [medline]","S1874-3919(13)00432-6 [pii]10.1016/j.jprot.2013.07.027 [doi]","ppublish","J Proteomics. 2013 Oct 8;91:297-308. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2013.07.027.

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to identify novel targets of miR-126-3p in vitro and then establish the outcomes of their dysregulation on adipocyte metabolism in vivo using a well-established maternal obesity mouse model. METHODS: miR-126-3p overexpression in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes followed by pulsed stable isotope labelling by amino acids in culture (pSILAC) was performed to identify novel targets of the miRNA. Well-established bioinformatics algorithms and luciferase assays were then employed to confirm those that were direct targets of miR-126-3p. Selected knockdown experiments were performed in vitro to define the consequences of target dysregulation. Quantitative real-time PCR, immunoblotting, histology, euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamps and glucose tolerance tests were performed to determine the phenotypic and functional outcomes of maternal programmed miR-126-3p levels in offspring adipose tissue. RESULTS: The proteomic approach confirmed the identity of known targets of miR-126-3p (including IRS-1) and identified Lunapark, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein, as a novel one. We confirmed by luciferase assay that Lunapark was a direct target of miR-126-3p. Overexpression of miR-126-3p in vitro led to a reduction in Lunapark protein levels and increased Perk (also known as Eif2ak3) mRNA levels and small interference-RNA mediated knockdown of Lunapark led to increased Xbp1, spliced Xbp1, Chop (also known as Ddit3) and Perk mRNA levels and an ER stress transcriptional response in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Consistent with the results found in vitro, increased miR-126-3p expression in adipose tissue from adult mouse offspring born to obese dams was accompanied by decreased Lunapark and IRS-1 protein levels and increased markers of ER stress. At the whole-body level the animals displayed glucose intolerance. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Concurrently targeting IRS-1 and Lunapark, a nutritionally programmed increase in miR-126-3p causes adipose tissue insulin resistance and an ER stress response, both of which may contribute to impaired glucose tolerance. These findings provide a novel mechanism by which obesity during pregnancy leads to increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the offspring and therefore identify miR-126-3p as a potential therapeutic target.","de Almeida-Faria, JulianaDuque-Guimarães, Daniella EOng, Thomas PPantaleão, Lucas CCarpenter, Asha ALoche, ElenaKusinski, Laura CAshmore, Thomas JAntrobus, RobinBushell, MartinFernandez-Twinn, Denise SOzanne, Susan E","de Almeida-Faria JAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7276-6924Duque-Guimarães DEOng TPPantaleão LCCarpenter AALoche EKusinski LCAshmore TJAntrobus RBushell MFernandez-Twinn DSAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2610-277XOzanne SEAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8753-5144","University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories and MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK. ju.almeidafaria@gmail.com.Obesity and Comorbidities Research Center, Faculty of Medical Sciences, State University of Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil. ju.almeidafaria@gmail.com.University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories and MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories and MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.Department of Food and Experimental Nutrition, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of São Paulo, Food Research Center, São Paulo, Brazil.University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories and MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories and MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories and MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories and MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories and MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Hills Road, Cambridge, UK.Cancer Research UK (CRUK), Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories and MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories and MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK. seo10@cam.ac.uk.","eng","MC_UU_12012/4/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United KingdomMC_UP_A600_1024/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United KingdomRG/17/12/33167/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United KingdomBB/M001636/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United KingdomMC_UU_00014/5/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United KingdomWT_/Wellcome Trust/United KingdomPG/14/20/30769/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom29252/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United KingdomMC_UU_00014/4/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom24388/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom","Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20210127","Germany","Diabetologia","Diabetologia","0006777","0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Homeodomain Proteins)0 (Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins)0 (Irs1 protein, mouse)0 (Lnpk protein, mouse)0 (MIRN126 microRNA, mouse)0 (MicroRNAs)","IM","3T3-L1 CellsAdipocytes/*metabolism/pathologyAdipose Tissue/*metabolism/pathologyAnimalsBlood Glucose/metabolismDisease Models, AnimalDown-Regulation*Endoplasmic Reticulum StressFemaleHomeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolismInsulin Receptor Substrate Proteins/genetics/metabolismInsulin ResistanceMiceMice, Inbred C57BLMicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolismPregnancy in Obesity/genetics/*metabolism/pathologyPhenotypePregnancy*Prenatal Exposure Delayed EffectsSignal Transduction","PMC7940301",NA,"NOTNLM","ER stressGlucose metabolismLunaparkMaternal obesityNutritional programmingmiR-126-3p",NA,"2021/01/28 06:00","2022/02/16 06:00","2021/01/27","2021/01/27 05:55","2020/08/04 00:00 [received]2020/10/26 00:00 [accepted]2021/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]2022/02/16 06:00 [medline]2021/01/27 05:55 [entrez]2021/01/27 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1007/s00125-020-05357-4 [pii]5357 [pii]10.1007/s00125-020-05357-4 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetologia. 2021 Apr;64(4):890-902. doi: 10.1007/s00125-020-05357-4.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex and polygenic disease with increasing global prevalence and economic burden. In this study, the hypoglycemic effect of avicularin (quercetin-3-O-α-arabinofuranoside), a flavonoid glycoside commonly found in natural plants and fruits, was determined in a high fat diet/streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetes mouse model. Our results demonstrated that dietary avicularin treatment reduced levels of fasting blood glucose, serum TG and LDL-C, liver AST and ALT, and increased hepatic glycogen in T2DM mice. Furthermore, we used RNA-Seq and iTRAQ to compare the gene and protein expression in the livers of the normal control mice (NC), diabetic control mice (DC) and avicularin treated mice (DA100). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were analyzed based on gene annotations and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Integrated analysis of the RNA-Seq and iTRAQ data indicated that the fifteen DEGs/DEPs showed the same trend in mRNA and protein expression levels in comparisons of both NC vs DC and DC vs DA100. KEGG analysis revealed that four DEGs/DEPs (PKM, PEPCK, PYG, and PLA2) in the glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and arachidonic acid pathway, and six DEPs (Ndufb4, Ndufa6, Cox5a, Cox5b, Cox6c, and ATPSβ) in the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, play important roles in avicularin's hypoglycemic effect. We also found six other DEGs/DEPs related to T2DM (CA1, Serpinb6a, AK, Pcolce, Cand2, and Atp2a3), and five related to cancer (Phgdh, Tes, Papss1, Psat1, and Fam49b). We did further verify by qRT-PCR and explored the possible binding modes of avicularin with targeted proteins with molecular docking simulations. Taken together, our results demonstrated the protective effects of avicularin against diabetes and provided a global view about the system-level hypoglycemic mechanisms of avicularin by the comprehensive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data in T2DM mice.","Zhu, XiaoaiQiu, ZhirouOuyang, WenMiao, JianyinXiong, PingMao, DuobinFeng, KonglongLi, MinxiongLuo, MinnaXiao, HangCao, Yong","Zhu XQiu ZOuyang WMiao JXiong PMao DFeng KLi MLuo MXiao HCao Y","Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods, College of Food Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, PR China; Department of Food Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003, United States.Zhaoqing University, Zhaoqing 526000, PR China.School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha 410007, PR China.Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods, College of Food Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, PR China.Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods, College of Food Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, PR China.Collaborative Innovation Center of Food Production and Safety, Henan Key Laboratory of Cold Chain Food Quality and Safety Control, School of Food and Biological Engineering, Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, Zhengzhou 450002, PR China.Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods, College of Food Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, PR China.Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods, College of Food Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, PR China.Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nutraceuticals and Functional Foods, College of Food Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, PR China.Department of Food Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003, United States.

We sought to identify proteomic markers of undetected dysglycaemia (impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes mellitus) to improve the identification of patients at highest risk for diabetes. Materials and methods: In this prospective cohort, 626 patients without known diabetes underwent oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) during admission for MI. Proximity extension assay was used to measure 81 biomarkers. Multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for risk factors, was used to evaluate the association of biomarkers with dysglycaemia. Subsequently, lasso regression was performed in a 2/3 training set to identify proteomic biomarkers with prognostic value for dysglycaemia, when added to risk factors, fasting plasma glucose, and glycated haemoglobin A1c. Determination of discriminatory ability was performed in a 1/3 test set. Results: In total, 401/626 patients (64.1%) met the criteria for dysglycaemia. Using multivariable logistic regression, cathepsin D had the strongest association with dysglycaemia. Lasso regression selected seven markers, including cathepsin D, that improved prediction of dysglycaemia (area under the receiver operator curve [AUC] 0.848 increased to 0.863). In patients with normal fasting plasma glucose, only cathepsin D was selected (AUC 0.699 increased to 0.704). Conclusions: Newly detected dysglycaemia, including manifest diabetes, is common in patients with acute MI. Cathepsin D improved the prediction of dysglycaemia, which may be helpful in the a priori risk determination of diabetes as a motivation for confirmatory OGTT.","Velders, Matthijs ACalais, FredrikDahle, NinaFall, ToveHagström, EmilLeppert, JerzyNowak, ChristophTenerz, ÅkeÄrnlöv, JohanHedberg, Pär","Velders MACalais FDahle NFall THagström ELeppert JNowak CTenerz ÅÄrnlöv JHedberg P","Department of Medicine, Västmanland County Hospital , Västerås , Sweden.Örebro University, Faculty of Health, Department of Cardiology , Örebro , Sweden.Centre for Clinical Research, Uppsala University , Falun , Dalarna , Sweden.Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Epidemiology and SciLife Laboratory, Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden.Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Epidemiology and SciLife Laboratory, Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden.Uppsala Clinical Research Center, Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden.Centre for Clinical Research, Uppsala University, Västmanland County Hospital , Västerås , Sweden.Division of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society (NVS), Karolinska Institutet , Huddinge , Sweden.Department of Medicine, Västmanland County Hospital , Västerås , Sweden.Division of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society (NVS), Karolinska Institutet , Huddinge , Sweden.School of Health and Social Studies, Dalarna University , Falun , Sweden.Centre for Clinical Research, Uppsala University, Västmanland County Hospital , Västerås , Sweden.Department of Clinical Physiology, Västmanland County Hospital , Västerås , Sweden.","eng",NA,"Comparative StudyJournal Article","20190820","Sweden","Ups J Med Sci","Upsala journal of medical sciences","0332203","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Glycated Hemoglobin A)EC 3.4.23.5 (Cathepsin D)","IM","Biomarkers/bloodBlood Glucose/*analysisCathepsin D/*bloodCohort StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*diagnosis/epidemiologyFemaleFollow-Up StudiesGlucose Tolerance TestGlycated Hemoglobin/*analysisHospitalizationHospitals, CountyHumansIncidenceIncidental FindingsLogistic ModelsMaleMultivariate AnalysisMyocardial Infarction/blood/*diagnosis/therapyProspective StudiesRisk AssessmentSweden","PMC7182365",NA,"NOTNLM","Acute myocardial infarctionbiomarkersdiabetes mellitusproteomics",NA,"2019/08/21 06:00","2020/02/26 06:00","2019/08/20","2019/08/21 06:00","2019/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]2020/02/26 06:00 [medline]2019/08/21 06:00 [entrez]2019/08/20 00:00 [pmc-release]","1650141 [pii]10.1080/03009734.2019.1650141 [doi]","ppublish","Ups J Med Sci. 2019 Aug;124(3):187-192. doi: 10.1080/03009734.2019.1650141.

Elevated circulating proline levels have been found in subjects with insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we assessed β-cell function, gene expressions, and cell death after long-term exposure of pancreatic β-cells to excess proline in vitro. METHODS: Isolated mouse islets and INS-1E cells were incubated with and without excess proline. After 72 h, we examined: (1) β-cell function, including basal insulin secretion (BIS) and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), (2) transcription factors related to insulin gene expression and enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and cholesterol biogenesis, (3) cellular triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol content, (4) the death of INS-1E cells and 3H thymidine incorporation, and (5) protein expression of INS-1E cells in response to proline by proteomics. RESULTS: We found that high doses of proline increased BIS and decreased GSIS in both isolated mouse islets and INS-1E cells. MafA, insulin 1, and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIa polypeptide 2 mRNA expressions were all downregulated, indicating that proline impaired insulin gene transcription and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, mevalonate decarboxylase gene expression was upregulated, and simultaneously, cholesterol content in INS-1E cells was enhanced. Protein profiling of INS-1E cells revealed that cytosolic non-specific dipeptidase and α enolase were differentially expressed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that proline-induced insulin transcription and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation impairment may contribute to the β-cell dysfunction observed in type 2 diabetes. Caution should be applied in interpreting the pathophysiological role of proline since very high proline concentrations were used in the experiments.","Liu, ZhenpingJeppesen, Per BGregersen, SørenBach Larsen, LotteHermansen, Kjeld","Liu ZJeppesen PBGregersen SBach Larsen LHermansen K","Department of Medicine and Endocrinology, Aarhus University Hospital, Tage-Hansens Gade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.Department of Medicine and Endocrinology, Aarhus University Hospital, Tage-Hansens Gade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.Department of Medicine and Endocrinology, Aarhus University Hospital, Tage-Hansens Gade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.Department of Food Science, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Aarhus University, DK-8230 Tjele, Denmark.Department of Medicine and Endocrinology, Aarhus University Hospital, Tage-Hansens Gade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20160510","Singapore","Rev Diabet Stud","The review of diabetic studies : RDS","101227575","0 (Insulin)9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IM","AnimalsCell Death/*drug effectsCell LineElectron Transport Complex IV/metabolismFemaleGlucose/pharmacologyInsulin/metabolismInsulin-Secreting Cells/*drug effects/metabolismIslets of Langerhans/drug effects/metabolismMicePhosphorylation/drug effectsProline/*pharmacology","PMC5291183",NA,NA,NA,"The authors report no conflict of interests.","2016/08/27 06:00","2017/11/04 06:00","2017/05/10","2016/08/27 06:00","2016/08/27 06:00 [entrez]2016/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]2017/11/04 06:00 [medline]2017/05/10 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1900/RDS.2016.13.66 [doi]","ppublish","Rev Diabet Stud. 2016 Spring;13(1):66-78. doi: 10.1900/RDS.2016.13.66.

Previously we showed that levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-18 (IL-18), are elevated in post-mortem AD brains. IL-18 can modulate the tau kinases, Cdk5 and GSK3β, as well as Aβ-production. IL-18 levels are also increased in AD risk diseases, including type-2 diabetes and obesity. Here, we explored other IL-18 regulated proteins in neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells. Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, incubated with IL-18 for 24, 48, or 72 h, were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Specific altered protein spots were chosen and identified with mass spectrometry (MS) and verified by western immunoblotting (WIB). IL-18 had time-dependent effects on the SH-SY5Y proteome, modulating numerous protein levels/modifications. We concentrated on those related to OS (DDAH2, peroxiredoxins 2, 3, and 6, DJ-1, BLVRA), Aβ-degradation (MMP14, TIMP2), Aβ-aggregation (Septin-2), and modifications of axon growth and guidance associated, collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). IL-18 significantly increased antioxidative enzymes, indicative of OS, and altered levels of glycolytic α and γ-enolase and multifunctional 14-3-3γ and -ε, commonly affected in neurodegenerative diseases. MMP14, TIMP2, α-enolase and 14-3-3ε, indirectly involved in Aβ metabolism, as well as Septin-2 showed changes that increase Aβ levels. Increased 14-3-3γ may contribute to GSK3β driven tau hyperphosphorylation and CRMP2 Thr514 and Ser522 phosphorylation with the Thr555-site, a target for Rho kinase, showing time-dependent changes. IL-18 also increased caspase-1 levels and vacuolization of the cells. Although our SH-SY5Y cells were not aged, as neurons in AD, our work suggests that heightened or prolonged IL-18 levels can drive protein changes of known relevance to AD pathogenesis.","Sutinen, Elina MKorolainen, Minna AHäyrinen, JukkaAlafuzoff, IrinaPetratos, StevenSalminen, AnteroSoininen, HilkkaPirttilä, TuulaOjala, Johanna O","Sutinen EMKorolainen MAHäyrinen JAlafuzoff IPetratos SSalminen ASoininen HPirttilä TOjala JO","Department of Neurology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland Kuopio, Finland ; Brain Research Unit, Clinical Research Centre, University of Eastern Finland Kuopio, Finland.Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki Helsinki, Finland.School of Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Eastern Finland Kuopio, Finland.Rudbecklaboratoriet, Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Molecular and Morphological Pathology, Uppsala University Uppsala, Sweden.Regenerative Neuroscience and Development Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Central Clinical School, Monash University Prahran, VIC, Australia.Department of Neurology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland Kuopio, Finland ; Department of Neurology, Kuopio University Hospital Kuopio, Finland.Department of Neurology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland Kuopio, Finland ; Brain Research Unit, Clinical Research Centre, University of Eastern Finland Kuopio, Finland ; Department of Neurology, Kuopio University Hospital Kuopio, Finland.Department of Neurology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland Kuopio, Finland ; Brain Research Unit, Clinical Research Centre, University of Eastern Finland Kuopio, Finland ; Department of Neurology, Kuopio University Hospital Kuopio, Finland.Department of Neurology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland Kuopio, Finland ; Brain Research Unit, Clinical Research Centre, University of Eastern Finland Kuopio, Finland.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20140807","Switzerland","Front Cell Neurosci","Frontiers in cellular neuroscience","101477935",NA,NA,NA,"PMC4124869",NA,"NOTNLM","CRMP2DDAHInterleukin-18MMP14inflammationneurodegenerative diseasesoxidative stress related proteinsproteomics",NA,"2014/08/26 06:00","2014/08/26 06:01","2014/01/01","2014/08/23 06:00","2014/05/20 00:00 [received]2014/07/16 00:00 [accepted]2014/08/23 06:00 [entrez]2014/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]2014/08/26 06:01 [medline]2014/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.3389/fncel.2014.00214 [doi]","epublish","Front Cell Neurosci. 2014 Aug 7;8:214. doi: 10.3389/fncel.2014.00214. eCollection 2014.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3389/fncel.2014.00214",NA,2014

Nevertheless, comprehensive researches on its role have not been performed. We here conducted an integrated analysis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) metabolism of fads2-deletion zebrafish (fads2(-/-)) by transcriptomics, proteomics and phosphoproteomics. Compared with wild type zebrafish (WT), fads2(-/-) showed significantly higher contents of hepatic linoleic acid (all-cis-9,12-C18:2), α-linolenic acid (all-cis-9,12,15-C18:3) and docosapetaenoic acid (all-cis-7,10,13,16,19-C22:5), and lower contents of γ-linolenic acid (all-cis-6,9,12-C18:3), stearidonic acid (all-cis-6,9,12,15-C18:4) and docosahexaenoic acid (all-cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-C22:6), accompanied by an increased n-6/n-3 PUFA level. In total, we identified 1608 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 209 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and 153 differentially expressed phosphorylated proteins (DEPPs) with 190 sites between fads2(-/-) and WT. Transcriptome and proteome analysis simultaneously aggregated these DEGs and DEPs into LC-PUFA synthesis and PPAR signaling pathways. Further interaction network analysis of the DEPPs showed that spliceosome and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway were critical groups. Additionally, we determined seven highly phosphorylated kinases and a highly expressed phosphatase in fads2(-/-) zebrafish. These results give insights into the mechanism by which fads2 affects metabolic disease occurrence, and provide datasets for target selections for human disease treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: Balanced LC-PUFA composition was deeply associated with body health, while changes of LC-PUFAs usually induced serious diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and inflammatory disease. Fatty acid desaturase 2 (Fads2), subordinating to the fatty acid desaturase protein family, catalyzes the first desaturation reaction in LC-PUFA synthesis. Although Fads2 is associated with many chronic diseases including metabolic abnormalities, type 2 diabetes and obesity, comprehensive researches on its role have not been performed. On the basis of the integrated transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome analysis, we identified that fads2 was critical for maintaining body LC-PUFA homeostasis. Moreover, the crucial pathways including PPAR signaling pathway, spliceosome and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway, and candidate kinase targets associated with LC-PUFA metabolism were determined. These findings will contribute to the revealing of the mechanism and supply possible datasets for target selection for human disease treatment.","Zhao, YanYang, GangWu, NingyuanCao, XiaojuanGao, Jian","Zhao YYang GWu NCao XGao J","College of Fisheries, Key Lab of Agricultural Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Ministry of Education/Key Lab of Freshwater Animal Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.College of Fisheries, Key Lab of Agricultural Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Ministry of Education/Key Lab of Freshwater Animal Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.College of Fisheries, Key Lab of Agricultural Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Ministry of Education/Key Lab of Freshwater Animal Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China; National Demonstration Center for Experimental Aquaculture Education, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.College of Fisheries, Key Lab of Agricultural Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Ministry of Education/Key Lab of Freshwater Animal Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.College of Fisheries, Key Lab of Agricultural Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Ministry of Education/Key Lab of Freshwater Animal Breeding, Ministry of Agriculture, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The hedonic and homeostatic appetite control in obesity and type 2 diabetes in the context of meal and exercise timing (TIMEX) study is a randomised, controlled, cross-over trial. Fifty-eight women and men (aged 18-75 years) with overweight or obesity (body mass index ≥25 kg/m(2)) with or without T2D will be recruited. All participants will complete a screening and baseline visit followed by four test visits: two morning visits and two late afternoon visits. The participants will arrive in the fasted state during the visits. During one morning visit and one late afternoon visit, the participants will engage in a 45-min bout of acute high-intensity interval exercise on an ergometer bicycle. The remaining two visits (one morning and one late afternoon visit) will include 45 min of rest. Fifteen minutes after the rest or exercise period, the participants will be presented with an ad libitum meal. Blood samples will be collected and subjective appetite will be assessed using Visual Analogue Scales in the fasted state before exercise/rest, immediately post-exercise/rest and at 15, 30, 45 and 60 min post-exercise/rest. Food reward and food preferences will be assessed using the validated diurnal version of the Steno Biometric Food Preference Task in the fasted state before exercise/rest and 15 min after the ad libitum meal (45 min post-exercise/rest). The primary outcome is the difference in ad libitum energy intake after exercise compared with rest. Secondary outcomes include eating rate; 24-hour energy intake; appetite-related metabolites and hormones, and circulating biomarkers assessed from proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics analyses; food choice, food attention and reaction time, explicit and implicit liking and wanting for different food categories, subjective appetite; ratings of perceived exertion during exercise. All outcomes will be compared between morning and late afternoon and between participants with and without T2D. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark (H-22019913) and the Capital Region of Denmark's Research Register (Privacy). The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All results will be published in national and international peer-reviewed journals and will be disseminated at national and international conferences.

However, there is currently no technical platform that could measure these markers concurrently in a cost-effective manner. We have developed a new assay that is able to measure glucose, HbA1c, glycated HSA, and glycated apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) for monitoring of individual blood glycemia, as well as cysteinylated HSA, S-nitrosylated HbA, and methionine-oxidized apoA-I for gauging oxidative stress and cardiovascular risks, all in 5 μL of blood. The assay utilizes our proprietary multinozzle emitter array chip technology to enable the analysis of small volumes of blood, without complex sample preparation prior to the online and on-chip liquid chromatography-nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Importantly, the assay employs top-down proteomics for more accurate quantitation of protein levels and for identification of post-translational modifications. Further, the assay provides multimarker, multitime-scale, and multicompartment monitoring of blood glycemia. Our assay readily segregates healthy controls from Type 2 diabetes patients and may have the potential to enable better long-term monitoring and disease management of diabetes.","Mao, PanWang, Daojing","Mao PWang D","Newomics Inc. , 5980 Horton Street, Suite 525, Emeryville, California 94608, United States.","eng","R43ES022360/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United StatesR43ES023529/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United StatesR43 ES023529/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United StatesR43 ES022360/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United StatesHHSN261201300033C/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., Extramural","20140217","United States","J Proteome Res","Journal of proteome research","101128775","0 (Apolipoprotein A-I)0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Glycated Hemoglobin A)0 (Hemoglobins)0 (Serum Albumin)0 (hemoglobin A1c protein, human)0 (nitrosyl hemoglobin)AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)","IM","Apolipoprotein A-I/blood/chemistryBiomarkers/bloodBlood Glucose/analysisCase-Control StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/diagnosisGlycated Hemoglobin/analysisGlycosylationHemoglobins/analysisHumansMethionine/chemistryMicrofluidic Analytical Techniques/methodsOxidation-Reduction*Protein Processing, Post-TranslationalProteomics/*methodsSerum Albumin/analysis/chemistrySpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization","PMC3993886","NIHMS565883",NA,NA,NA,"2014/02/19 06:00","2014/11/05 06:00","2015/02/17","2014/02/19 06:00","2014/02/19 06:00 [entrez]2014/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]2015/02/17 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1021/pr401074t [doi]","ppublish","J Proteome Res. 2014 Mar 7;13(3):1560-9. doi: 10.1021/pr401074t.

It accounts for ~80% of insulin stimulated glucose disposal. Skeletal muscle insulin resistance, a primary feature of Type 2 diabetes, is caused by a decreased ability of muscle to respond to circulating insulin. Physical exercise improves insulin sensitivity and whole body metabolism and remains one of the most promising interventions for the prevention of Type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance and exercise adaptations in skeletal muscle might be a cause, or consequence, of altered protein expressions profiles and/or their posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics offer enormous promise for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle insulin resistance and exercise-induced adaptation; however, skeletal muscle proteomics are challenging. This review describes the technical limitations of skeletal muscle proteomics as well as emerging developments in proteomics workflow with respect to samples preparation, liquid chromatography (LC), MS and computational analysis. These technologies have not yet been fully exploited in the field of skeletal muscle proteomics. Future studies that involve state-of-the-art proteomics technology will broaden our understanding of exercise-induced adaptations as well as molecular pathogenesis of insulin resistance. This could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets.","Deshmukh, Atul S","Deshmukh AS","The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 3b, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark. atul.deshmukh@cpr.ku.dk.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20160204","Switzerland","Proteomes","Proteomes","101621966",NA,NA,NA,"PMC5217365",NA,"NOTNLM","diabetesexercise adaptationsfatglucosemass spectrometrypost-translational modificationssecretome",NA,"2017/03/02 06:00","2017/03/02 06:01","2016/02/04","2017/03/02 06:00","2015/11/16 00:00 [received]2016/01/25 00:00 [revised]2016/01/28 00:00 [accepted]2017/03/02 06:00 [entrez]2017/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]2017/03/02 06:01 [medline]2016/02/04 00:00 [pmc-release]","proteomes4010006 [pii]proteomes-04-00006 [pii]10.3390/proteomes4010006 [doi]","epublish","Proteomes. 2016 Feb 4;4(1):6. doi: 10.3390/proteomes4010006.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/proteomes4010006",NA,2016

The disease process that underlies progressive renal decline comprises factors that increase risk as well as factors that protect against this outcome. Using untargeted proteomic profiling of circulating proteins from individuals in two independent cohorts with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and varying stages of DKD followed for 7 to 15 years, we identified three elevated plasma proteins-fibroblast growth factor 20 (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88), angiopoietin-1 (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.91), and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 12 (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.95)-that were associated with protection against progressive renal decline and progression to ESRD. The combined effect of these three protective proteins was demonstrated by very low cumulative risk of ESRD in those who had baseline concentrations above median for all three proteins, whereas the cumulative risk of ESRD was high in those with concentrations below median for these proteins at the beginning of follow-up. This protective effect was shown to be independent from circulating inflammatory proteins and clinical covariates and was confirmed in a third cohort of diabetic individuals with normal renal function. These three protective proteins may serve as biomarkers to stratify diabetic individuals according to risk of progression to ESRD and might also be investigated as potential therapeutics to delay or prevent the onset of ESRD.","Md Dom, Zaipul ISatake, EiichiroSkupien, JanKrolewski, BozenaO'Neil, KristinaWillency, Jill ADillon, Simon TWilson, Jonathan MKobayashi, HirokiIhara, KatsuhitoLibermann, Towia APragnell, MarlonDuffin, Kevin LKrolewski, Andrzej S","Md Dom ZIAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3503-7391Satake EAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9784-4423Skupien JKrolewski BO'Neil KAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2020-8728Willency JAAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2569-6046Dillon STAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4417-178XWilson JMAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8648-600XKobayashi HAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9674-0374Ihara KLibermann TAPragnell MAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8976-3511Duffin KLAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1656-8982Krolewski ASAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1705-2953","Research Division, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA.Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.Research Division, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA.Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.Department of Metabolic Diseases, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 31-008 Krakow, Poland.Research Division, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA.Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.Research Division, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA.Diabetes and Complication Department, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN 46225, USA.Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.Genomics, Proteomics, Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA.Diabetes and Complication Department, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN 46225, USA.Research Division, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA.Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.Research Division, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA.Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.Genomics, Proteomics, Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA.JDRF International, New York, NY 10281, USA.Diabetes and Complication Department, Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN 46225, USA.Research Division, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA. andrzej.krolewski@joslin.harvard.edu.Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.","eng","P30 DK036836/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR01 DK041526/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"United States","Sci Transl Med","Science translational medicine","101505086","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Biomarkers*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2Disease ProgressionGlomerular Filtration RateHumansKidney/physiology*Kidney Failure, ChronicProteomicsRisk Factors","PMC9022453","NIHMS1793316",NA,NA,"Competing interests: A.S.K. is a co-inventor of the “TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 patent for predicting risk of ESRD”.

Thus, proteomic approaches to identify DN-related biomarker were performed. METHODS: A comparative proteomic approach of 2-D gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry to identify biomarkers in urine samples from 12 DN patients (six type 1 and six type 2 diabetic patients) and six healthy controls. Then, the urinary level of identified protein biomarker was detected by immunoturbidimetry assay in urine samples from 90 type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients with normo-, micro and macroalbuminuria (n = 30 in each group), and 30 healthy controls. RESULTS: A novel DN-related protein, orosomucoid (alpha1-acid glycoprotein), was identified by proteomic method. Its abundance was highly upregulated (>eightfold) in DN patients. The data of immunoturbidimetry assay showed urinary orosomucoid excretion rate (UOER) was gradually increased in the normo-, micro and macroalbuminuria group versus control (0.71 +/ 0.41, 1.93 +/ 0.68, 2.88 +/ 0.94 vs 0.39 +/ 0.28 ug/min, P < 0.05). The result indicated that UOER increased in early stage of DN and gradually increased with the development of DN. Also, Pearson's correlation analysis indicated UOER was positively correlated with urinary albumin excretion rate, serum creatinine and C-reactive protein (r = 0.830, 0.787 and 0.360, respectively; P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis also showed that increased UOER was an independent risk factor for DN (odds ratio = 3.10, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Urinary orosomucoid is a DN-related biomarker, which is associated with the development and progression of DN. Furthermore, increased UOER is an independent risk factor of DN.","Jiang, HongjuanGuan, GuangjuZhang, RuiLiu, GangLiu, HaiyingHou, XianghuaCheng, Jing","Jiang HGuan GZhang RLiu GLiu HHou XCheng J","Department of Nephrology, The Second Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20090108","Australia","Nephrology (Carlton)","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)","9615568","0 (Orosomucoid)","IM","AdultDiabetic Nephropathies/diagnosis/*urineElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-DimensionalFemaleHumansLogistic ModelsMaleMiddle AgedOrosomucoid/*urineRiskSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2009/01/16 09:00","2009/07/16 09:00",NA,"2009/01/16 09:00","2009/01/16 09:00 [entrez]2009/01/16 09:00 [pubmed]2009/07/16 09:00 [medline]","NEP1053 [pii]10.1111/j.1440-1797.2008.01053.x [doi]","ppublish","Nephrology (Carlton). 2009 Apr;14(3):332-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1797.2008.01053.x.

In vitro exposure of β-cells to the saturated free fatty acid palmitate is a valuable model of lipotoxicity, reproducing features of β-cell failure observed in type 2 diabetes. In order to map the β-cell response to lipotoxicity, we combined RNA-sequencing of palmitate-treated human islets with iTRAQ proteomics of insulin-secreting INS-1E cells following a time course exposure to palmitate. RESULTS: Crossing transcriptome and proteome of palmitate-treated β-cells revealed 85 upregulated and 122 downregulated genes at both transcript and protein level. Pathway analysis identified lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, amino-acid metabolism and cell cycle pathways among the most enriched palmitate-modified pathways. Palmitate induced gene expression changes compatible with increased free fatty acid mitochondrial import and β-oxidation, decreased lipogenesis and modified cholesterol transport. Palmitate modified genes regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function, ER-to-Golgi transport and ER stress pathways. Furthermore, palmitate modulated cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, inhibiting expression of PKA anchoring proteins and downregulating the GLP-1 receptor. SLC7 family amino-acid transporters were upregulated in response to palmitate but this induction did not contribute to β-cell demise. To unravel critical mediators of lipotoxicity upstream of the palmitate-modified genes, we identified overrepresented transcription factor binding sites and performed network inference analysis. These identified LXR, PPARα, FOXO1 and BACH1 as key transcription factors orchestrating the metabolic and oxidative stress responses to palmitate. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to combine transcriptomic and sensitive time course proteomic profiling of palmitate-exposed β-cells. Our results provide comprehensive insight into gene and protein expression changes, corroborating and expanding beyond previous findings. The identification of critical drivers and pathways of the β-cell lipotoxic response points to novel therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes.","Lytrivi, MariaGhaddar, KassemLopes, MiguelRosengren, VictoriaPiron, AnthonyYi, XiaoyanJohansson, HenrikLehtiö, JanneIgoillo-Esteve, MarianaCunha, Daniel AMarselli, LorellaMarchetti, PieroOrtsäter, HenrikEizirik, Decio LCnop, Miriam","Lytrivi MGhaddar KLopes MRosengren VPiron AYi XJohansson HLehtiö JIgoillo-Esteve MCunha DAMarselli LMarchetti POrtsäter HEizirik DLCnop MAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5112-1692","ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Université Libre de Bruxelles, CP-618, Route de Lennik 808, 1070, Brussels, Belgium.Division of Endocrinology, Erasmus Hospital, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Université Libre de Bruxelles, CP-618, Route de Lennik 808, 1070, Brussels, Belgium.ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Université Libre de Bruxelles, CP-618, Route de Lennik 808, 1070, Brussels, Belgium.Diabetes Research Unit, Department of Clinical Science and Education, Sodersjukhuset, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Université Libre de Bruxelles, CP-618, Route de Lennik 808, 1070, Brussels, Belgium.ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Université Libre de Bruxelles, CP-618, Route de Lennik 808, 1070, Brussels, Belgium.Clinical Proteomics Mass Spectrometry, Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Science for Life Laboratory, 171 21, Solna, Sweden.Clinical Proteomics Mass Spectrometry, Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Science for Life Laboratory, 171 21, Solna, Sweden.ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Université Libre de Bruxelles, CP-618, Route de Lennik 808, 1070, Brussels, Belgium.ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Université Libre de Bruxelles, CP-618, Route de Lennik 808, 1070, Brussels, Belgium.Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.Diabetes Research Unit, Department of Clinical Science and Education, Sodersjukhuset, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Université Libre de Bruxelles, CP-618, Route de Lennik 808, 1070, Brussels, Belgium.ULB Center for Diabetes Research, Université Libre de Bruxelles, CP-618, Route de Lennik 808, 1070, Brussels, Belgium. mcnop@ulb.ac.be.Division of Endocrinology, Erasmus Hospital, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium. mcnop@ulb.ac.be.","eng","667191/European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, project T2DSystems/Rhapsody/Innovative Medicines Initiative/","Journal Article","20200826","England","BMC Genomics","BMC genomics","100965258","0 (Palmitates)0 (Proteome)","IM","Apoptosis*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2Humans*Insulin-Secreting CellsPalmitates/toxicityProteomeProteomicsTranscriptome","PMC7448506",NA,"NOTNLM","Beta-cellsEndoplasmic reticulum stressFree fatty acidsLipid metabolismPancreatic isletsProteomeRNA-sequencingType 2 diabetes","None.","2020/08/28 06:00","2021/05/15 06:00","2020/08/26","2020/08/28 06:00","2020/01/14 00:00 [received]2020/08/19 00:00 [accepted]2020/08/28 06:00 [entrez]2020/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]2020/08/26 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1186/s12864-020-07003-0 [pii]7003 [pii]10.1186/s12864-020-07003-0 [doi]","epublish","BMC Genomics. 2020 Aug 26;21(1):590. doi: 10.1186/s12864-020-07003-0.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1186/s12864-020-07003-0",NA,2020

Human mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (hUCMSCs-Exo) have diverse functions in improving microcirculation; however, the molecular mechanism of hUCMSCs-Exo in regulating burn-induced inflammation is not well understood. METHODS: hUCMSCs-Exo were extracted by hypervelocity centrifugation method, and exosome morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy, exosome diameter distribution was detected by particle size analysis, and exosome specific proteins were identified by Western blot.2. DB/DB mice were randomly divided into exosomes group and PBS group. Exosomes and PBS were injected into the tail vein, respectively, and the calf muscle tissue was taken 28 days later. 0.5% Evans blue fluorescence assessment microvascular permeability. The expression of CD31 was detected by immunofluorescence.The morphology and function of microvessels in muscle tissue of lower limbs was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy.3. TMT proteomics was used to detect the changes of differential protein expression in lower limb muscle tissues of the PBS group and the exosome group, and data analysis was performed to screen key signal molecules and their involved biological pathways. Key signal molecules CD105 were verified by Western blot. The expression of TGF-β1 in exosomes were evaluated by Western blot. RESULTS: Electron microscopy showed that hUCMSCs-Exo presented a uniform vesicle structure, and NTA showed that its diameter was about 160 nm. Western blot showed positive expression of specific proteins CD9, CD81 and TSG101 on exosomes.2. There is no significant change in blood glucose and body weight before and after the exosome treatment. The exosome group can significantly reduce the exudation of Evans blue. Compared with the PBS group. Meanwhile, CD31 immunofluorescence showed that the red fluorescence of exosome treatment was significantly increased, which was higher than that of PBS group. Transmission electron microscopy showed smooth capillary lumen and smooth and complete surface of endothelial cells in the exosome group, while narrow capillary lumen and fingerlike protrusion of endothelial cells in the PBS group.3.Quantitative analysis of TMT proteomics showed that there were 82 differential proteins, including 49 down-regulated proteins and 33 up-regulated proteins. Go enrichment analysis showed that the differential proteins were involved in molecular function, biological process, cell components,among which CD105 was one of the up-regulated proteins. Through literature search, CD105 was found to be related to endothelial cell proliferation. Therefore, this study verified the changes of CD105 in the exosome group, and it was used as the mechanism study of this study. 4. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of CD105 protein in lower limb muscle tissue of exosome group was significantly increased compared with that of PBS group. Based on the fact that CD105 is a component of the TGF-β1 receptor complex and exosomes are rich in growth factors and cytokines, this study further examined the expression of TGF-β1 in exosomes, and the results showed that exosomes had high expression of TGF-β1. CONCLUSION: By improving the integrity of microvascular endothelial cells, hUCMSCs-Exo can improve the permeability of microvessels in diabetic lower muscle tissue, further promote the proliferation of lower limb muscle cells and inhibit the apoptosis of tissue cells. The mechanism may be associated with exosomes rich in TGF-β1, which is likely to promote endothelial cell proliferation and improve permeability through binding to the endothelial CD105/TβR-II receptor complex, while promoting angiogenesis and protecting skeletal muscle cells from apoptosis.","Fan, WeijianZhou, MengdieZheng, ShaoqiuLiu, YangPan, SongsongGuo, PengXu, MinjieHu, ChaoDing, AnleWang, ZanYin, ShiwuZuo, KeqiangXie, Xiaoyun","Fan WZhou MZheng SLiu YPan SGuo PXu MHu CDing AWang ZYin SZuo KXie X","Department of Interventional & Vascular Surgery, Hefei Second People's Hospital, Hefei Hospital Affiliated to Anhui Medical University, Anhui, 230011, China.Geriatric department, Shanghai YangZhi Rehabilitation Hospital (Shanghai Sunshine Rehabilitation Center), School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, 201600, China.Department of Urinary Surgery Shanghai Pudong New District Zhoupu Hospital, Shanghai, 200100, China.Department of Geriatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200065, China.Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200072, China.Department of Vascular Surgery, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of ZhengZhou University, ZhengZhou, 450052, China.Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200072, China.Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200072, China.AnHui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, 232001, China.AnHui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, 232001, China.Department of Interventional & Vascular Surgery, Hefei Second People's Hospital, Hefei Hospital Affiliated to Anhui Medical University, Anhui, 230011, China.Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200072, China. 18917684112@163.com.Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200072, China. xiaoyunxietj@126.com.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20231115","England","Diabetol Metab Syndr","Diabetology & metabolic syndrome","101488958",NA,NA,NA,"PMC10652470",NA,"NOTNLM","CD105Diabetic peripheral angiopathyExosomesMicrovascularTGF-β1","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","2023/11/16 06:45","2023/11/16 06:46","2023/11/15","2023/11/16 00:22","2023/04/10 00:00 [received]2023/10/12 00:00 [accepted]2023/11/16 06:46 [medline]2023/11/16 06:45 [pubmed]2023/11/16 00:22 [entrez]2023/11/15 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1186/s13098-023-01191-x [pii]1191 [pii]10.1186/s13098-023-01191-x [doi]","epublish","Diabetol Metab Syndr. 2023 Nov 15;15(1):234. doi: 10.1186/s13098-023-01191-x.","© 2023.

In humans, the accumulation of omental rather than subcutaneous fat appears to be tightly linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Differences in gene expression profiles in the adipose tissue comparing non-obese and obese subjects have been well documented. However, to date, no comparative proteomic studies based on omental fat have investigated the influence of obesity in protein expression. In this work, we searched for proteins differentially expressed in the omental fat of non-obese and obese subjects using 2D-DIGE and MS. Forty-four proteins, several of which were further studied by immunoblotting and immunostaining analyses, showed significant differences in the expression levels in the two groups of subjects. Our findings reveal a clearly distinctive proteomic profile between obese and non-obese subjects which emphasizes: i) reduced metabolic activity in the obese fat, since most down-regulated proteins were engaged in metabolic pathways; and ii) morphological and structural cell changes in the obese fat, as revealed by the functions exerted by most up-regulated proteins. Interestingly, transketolase and aminoacylase-1 represent newly described molecules involved in the pathophysiology of obesity, thus opening up new possibilities in the study of obesity.","Pérez-Pérez, RafaelGarcía-Santos, EvaOrtega-Delgado, Francisco JLópez, Juan ACamafeita, EmilioRicart, WifredoFernández-Real, José-ManuelPeral, Belén","Pérez-Pérez RGarcía-Santos EOrtega-Delgado FJLópez JACamafeita ERicart WFernández-Real JMPeral B","Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Alberto Sols, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas & Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, E-28029 Madrid, Spain.","eng",NA,"Comparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20111001","Netherlands","J Proteomics","Journal of proteomics","101475056",NA,"IM","3T3-L1 CellsAbdominal Fat/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathologyAdultAnimalsFemale*Gene Expression RegulationHumansMaleMiceMiddle AgedObesity/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology*Protein Biosynthesis*Proteomics",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2011/10/13 06:00","2012/04/25 06:00",NA,"2011/10/13 06:00","2011/08/05 00:00 [received]2011/09/19 00:00 [revised]2011/09/22 00:00 [accepted]2011/10/13 06:00 [entrez]2011/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]","S1874-3919(11)00470-2 [pii]10.1016/j.jprot.2011.09.016 [doi]","ppublish","J Proteomics. 2012 Jan 4;75(3):783-95. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2011.09.016.

We studied alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST) in subjects randomized to placebo who completed assessments over 36 mo in a cardiovascular outcome trial [the Stabilisation of Atherosclerotic Plaque by Initiation of Darapladib Therapy (""STABILITY"") trial; n = 4,264; mean age: 64.2 yr] or over 12 mo in three trials that enrolled only subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) [the DIA trials; n = 308; mean age: 62.4 yr] to investigate time-dependent relationships and the factors that might affect ALT and AST, including body mass index (BMI), T2D, and renal function. Multivariate linear mixed models examined time-dependent relationships between liver enzyme concentrations as response variables and BMI, baseline T2D status, hemoglobin A(1c) levels, and renal function, as explanatory variables. At baseline, ALT was higher in individuals who were men, <65 yr old, and obese and who had glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >60 ml·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2). ALT was not significantly associated with T2D at baseline, although it was positively associated with HbA(1c). GFR had a greater impact on ALT than T2D. ALT concentrations decreased over time in subjects who lost weight but remained stable in individuals with increasing BMI. Weight change did not alter AST concentrations. We provide new insights on the influence of time, GFR, and HbA(1c) on ALT and AST concentrations and confirm the effect of sex, age, T2D, BMI, and BMI change in subjects receiving placebo in clinical trials. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Clinical trials provide high-quality data on liver enzyme concentrations from subjects randomized to placebo that can be used to investigate the epidemiology of these biomarkers. The adjusted models show the influence of sex, age, time, renal function, type 2 diabetes, HbA(1c), and body mass index on alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations and their relative importance. These factors need to be considered when assessing potential signals of hepatotoxicity in trials of new drugs and in clinical trials investigating subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","Nunez, Derek JAlexander, MyriamYerges-Armstrong, LauraSingh, GurparkashByttebier, GeertFabbrini, ElisaWaterworth, DawnMeininger, GaryGalwey, NicholasWallentin, LarsWhite, Harvey DVannieuwenhuyse, BartAlazawi, WilliamKendrick, StuartSattar, NaveedFerrannini, Ele","Nunez DJAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4704-3967Alexander MYerges-Armstrong LSingh GByttebier GFabbrini EWaterworth DMeininger GGalwey NWallentin LWhite HDVannieuwenhuyse BAlazawi WKendrick SSattar NFerrannini E","GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development (Metabolic Pathways and Cardiovascular Unit, and Genetics), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development, Stockley Park, United Kingdom.GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development (Metabolic Pathways and Cardiovascular Unit, and Genetics), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Belgium.Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Belgium.Janssen Research and Development, Raritan, New Jersey.GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development (Metabolic Pathways and Cardiovascular Unit, and Genetics), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Janssen Research and Development, Raritan, New Jersey.GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development, Stevenage, United Kingdom.Department of Medical Sciences, Cardiology and Uppsala Clinical Research Center, Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden.Auckland City Hospital Green Lane Cardiovascular Service , Auckland , New Zealand.Janssen Research and Development, Beerse, Belgium.Barts Liver Centre, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary, University of London , London , United Kingdom.GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development, Stevenage, United Kingdom.British Heart Foundation Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre, University of Glasgow , Glasgow , United Kingdom.Consiglio Nazionale delle Recerche Institute of Clinical Physiology, Pisa , Italy.","eng","MR/N00308X/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom","Journal ArticleRandomized Controlled TrialResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20181129","United States","Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol","American journal of physiology.

However, the importance of m(6)A alteration in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has not been explored. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate whether m(6)A content was reduced in T2DM patients and whether m(6)A content was correlated with the mRNA expression levels of the FTO and ALKBH5 genes. METHODS: In this case-control study, peripheral blood samples were obtained from 88 T2DM patients and 92 healthy controls. For the diabetic animal model experiment, blood samples were obtained from seven diabetic and eight nondiabetic rats. A sensitive liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for the determination of the m(6)A content in RNA, quantitative real-time PCR was used to examine the mRNA expression levels of the FTO and ALKBH5 genes, and high-resolution melting and DNA sequencing were used to detect FTO single-nucleotide polymorphisms. RESULTS: Our results showed that the m(6)A contents in the RNA from T2DM patients and diabetic rats were significantly lower compared with the control groups (P = 2.6 × 10(-24) for T2DM patients; P = .001 for diabetic rats, respectively), and T2DM can be characterized by the content of m(6)A. The mRNA expression level of FTO was significantly higher in T2DM patients than that of the controls (P = .0007) and was associated with the risk of T2DM (odds ratio 2.797, 95% confidence interval 1.452-5.389, P = .002). Moreover, the m(6)A contents were correlated with FTO mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the increased mRNA expression of FTO could be responsible for the reduction of m(6)A in T2DM, which may further increase the risk of complications of T2DM. Low m(6)A should be investigated further as a novel potential biomarker of T2DM.","Shen, FanHuang, WeiHuang, Jing-TaoXiong, JunYang, YingWu, KeJia, Gui-FangChen, JinyunFeng, Yu-QiYuan, Bi-FengLiu, Song-Mei","Shen FHuang WHuang JTXiong JYang YWu KJia GFChen JFeng YQYuan BFLiu SM","Center for Gene Diagnosis (F.S., J.-T.H., Y.Y., S.-M.L.), Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, People's Republic of China; Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Biology and Medicine (F.S., W.H., J.X., Y.-Q.F., B.-F.Y.)

To circumvent the principal barrier of serum proteomics, our investigation aimed to evaluate whether a study of post-translational modification enriched serum proteins could be valuable for the discovery of biomarkers or metabolic pathways related to type 2 diabetes pathogenesis. Type 2 diabetes was induced from high-fat diet fed Sprague Dawley rats with streptozotocin injection. Once diabetic status was confirmed, serum samples from either fasted healthy or diabetic rats were pooled and profiled by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis or comparative 2D electrophoresis after protein enrichments using immobilized metal ion, concanavalin A, and lentil affinity chromatography, respectively. Differential expressed proteins were identified and the associated networks were established by an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. As a result, induced rats became severe diabetic and accompanied by hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, and glomerular hypertrophy. There were 3 total, 14 phosphorylated and 23 glycosylated protein targets differentially expressed. Proteins could be linked to HNF4A, HNF1A, and NFκB transcriptional factors and antigen presentation, humoral immune response, and inflammatory response pathways. Predicted organ toxicity in kidney, heart, and liver matched with our histopathological results. In conclusion, post-translational modification based serum protein enrichment could be a valuable approach to enhance the resolution of serum proteomics without depleting potentially valuable abundant proteins. Our results also indicated the potential association of the hepatic secretome and hepatocyte nuclear factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and its complications.","Chen, Han-MinLee, Lin-ChienHu, Kuang-YuTsai, Wei-JernHuang, ChengTsay, Hui-JenLiu, Hui-Kang","Chen HMLee LCHu KYTsai WJHuang CTsay HJLiu HKAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5297-6836","Department of Life Science, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei city, Taiwan, ROC.Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.Department of Biochemistry, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.Division of Chinese Medicine Literature and Informatics, National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.Department of Earth and Life Sciences, University of Taipei, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.Institute of Neuroscience, Brain Research Center, school of life science, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.Division of Basic Chinese Medicine, National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.Ph.D. Program in Clinical Drug Development of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20181105","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Blood Proteins)","IM","AnimalsBlood Proteins/*metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental/blood/*complications/*metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*complications/*metabolismMale*Protein Processing, Post-Translational*ProteomicsRatsRats, Sprague-DawleySystems Biology","PMC6218044",NA,NA,NA,"The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2018/11/06 06:00","2019/04/09 06:00","2018/11/05","2018/11/06 06:00","2018/06/13 00:00 [received]2018/10/14 00:00 [accepted]2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]2019/04/09 06:00 [medline]2018/11/05 00:00 [pmc-release]","PONE-D-18-17744 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0206509 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2018 Nov 5;13(11):e0206509. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0206509. eCollection 2018.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0206509",NA,2018

Nicotine is the major alkaloid present in tobacco smoke, and many of the negative effects of smoking are attributed to nicotine. Nicotine is not only the addictive component of tobacco smoke, but also highly associated with carcinogenesis and induces oxidative stress. Furthermore, the administration of nicotine via subcutaneous mini-osmotic pumps or by injection is an established method in preclinical studies for this area of research. Thus, preclinical research on the negative effects of tobacco smoke and tobacco addiction has focused primarily on the effects of nicotine. However, there are over 4,500 components found in tobacco smoke, many of which are highly toxic. Other components may also contribute to the addictive properties of tobacco smoke. Furthermore, the negative effects of tobacco smoke are not isolated to the smoker but can have negative effects to those exposed to the secondhand smoke (SHS) stream. SHS exposure is the third leading cause of preventable death. Approximately 38,000 deaths per year are attributed to SHS exposure in the USA. SHS exposure increases the risk of heart disease by approximately 30% and is associated with increased risk of stroke, cancer, type II diabetes, as well as pulmonary disease. Thus, methods of administering tobacco smoke in a controlled environment will further our understanding of tobacco addiction and the role tobacco smoke in other disease states. Moreover, combining smoke exposure with proteomics can lead to the discovery of biomarkers that can be potentially useful tools in screening, early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases caused by SHS.","Guingab-Cagmat, JoyBauzo, Rayna MBruijnzeel, Adrie WWang, Kevin KGold, Mark SKobeissy, Firas H","Guingab-Cagmat JBauzo RMBruijnzeel AWWang KKGold MSKobeissy FH","Department of Psychiatry, Center for Neuroproteomics and Biomarkers Research at the Evelyn F. and William L.

The large quantity of these proteins makes it difficult to identify low abundance proteins in serum using traditional 2-dimensional electrophoresis. We recently used a combination of multidimensional liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-quadrupole-time of flight and Ion Trap liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify protein markers in sera of Alzheimer's disease (AD), insulin resistance/type-2 diabetes (IR/D2), and congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. We identified 8 proteins that exhibit higher levels in control sera and 36 proteins that exhibit higher levels in disease sera. For example, haptoglobin and hemoglobin are elevated in sera of AD, IR/D2, and CHF patients. The levels of several other proteins including fibrinogen and its fragments, alpha 2-macroglobulin, transthyretin, pro-platelet basic protein, protease inhibitors clade A and C, as well as proteins involved in the classical complement pathway such as complement C3, C4, and C1 inhibitor, were found to differ between IR/D2 and control sera. The sera levels of proteins, such as the 10 kDa subunit of vitronectin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, apolipoprotein B100, fragment of factor H, and histidine-rich glycoprotein were observed to be different between AD and controls. The differences observed in these biomarker candidates were confirmed by Western blot and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The biological meaning of the proteomic changes in the disease states and the potential use of these changes as diagnostic tools or for therapeutic intervention will be discussed.","Zhang, RulinBarker, LisaPinchev, DeborahMarshall, JohnRasamoelisolo, MichèleSmith, ChrisKupchak, PeterKireeva, IngaIngratta, LesleeJackowski, George","Zhang RBarker LPinchev DMarshall JRasamoelisolo MSmith CKupchak PKireeva IIngratta LJackowski G","Syn-X Pharma, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. rzhang@synxpharma.com","eng",NA,"Journal Article",NA,"Germany","Proteomics","Proteomics","101092707","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Proteome)","IM","Biomarkers/*bloodChromatography, LiquidElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-DimensionalHumansMass SpectrometryProteome/analysis/*chemistry*ProteomicsTerminology as Topic",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2004/01/20 05:00","2004/09/09 05:00",NA,"2004/01/20 05:00","2004/01/20 05:00 [pubmed]2004/09/09 05:00 [medline]2004/01/20 05:00 [entrez]","10.1002/pmic.200300495 [doi]","ppublish","Proteomics. 2004 Jan;4(1):244-56. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200300495.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2004

Because skeletal muscle has been shown to secrete proteins that could be used as biomarkers, we characterized the secreted protein profile of muscle cells derived from extremely obese (BMI 48.8 +/ 14.8 kg/m(2); homeostasis model assessment [HOMA] 3.6 +/ 1.0) relative to lean healthy subjects (BMI 25.7 +/ 3.2 kg/m(2); HOMA 0.8 +/ 0.2). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We hypothesized that skeletal muscle would secrete proteins that predict the severity of obesity. To test this hypothesis, we used a ""bottom-up"" experimental design using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in culture (SILAC) and liquid chromatography/mass spectometry/mass spectometry (LC-MS/MS) to both identify and quantify proteins secreted from cultured myotubes derived from extremely obese compared with healthy nonobese women. RESULTS: Using SILAC, we discovered a 2.9-fold increase in the secretion of myostatin from extremely obese human myotubes. The increased secretion and biological activity of myostatin were validated by immunoblot (3.16 +/ 0.18, P < 0.01) and a myoblast proliferation assay using conditioned growth medium. Myostatin was subsequently shown to increase in skeletal muscle (23%, P < 0.05) and plasma (35%, P < 0.05) and to correlate (r(2) = 0.6, P < 0.05) with the severity of insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Myostatin is a potent antianabolic regulator of muscle mass that may also play a role in energy metabolism. These findings show that increased expression of myostatin in skeletal muscle with obesity and insulin resistance results in elevated circulating myostatin. This may contribute to systemic metabolic deterioration of skeletal muscle with the progression of insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes.","Hittel, Dustin SBerggren, Jason RShearer, JaneBoyle, KristenHoumard, Joseph A","Hittel DSBerggren JRShearer JBoyle KHoumard JA","Human Performance Laboratory, Faculty of Kinesiology, Roger Jackson Center for Health and Wellness, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. dhittel@kin.ucalgary.ca","eng","R01 DK056112/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20081003","United States","Diabetes","Diabetes","0372763","0 (Myostatin)","IM","AdultChromatography, LiquidFemaleHumansImmunoblottingInsulin Resistance/physiologyMiddle AgedMuscle Fibers, Skeletal/metabolismMuscle, Skeletal/*metabolismMyostatin/blood/*metabolism/physiologyObesity/blood/*metabolism/physiopathologyTandem Mass Spectrometry","PMC2606890",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2008/10/07 09:00","2009/03/31 09:00","2010/01/01","2008/10/07 09:00","2008/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]2008/10/07 09:00 [entrez]2010/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","db08-0943 [pii]58130 [pii]10.2337/db08-0943 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes. 2009 Jan;58(1):30-8. doi: 10.2337/db08-0943.

Real-world electronic health records (EHRs) coupled with patient biospecimens, biological understanding, and technologies can characterize emerging diagnostic autoimmune markers resulting from proteomic discoveries. METHODS: Circulating autoantibodies for C-terminal fragments of adiponectin receptor 1 (IgG-CTF) were measured by immunoassay to establish the reference range using midpoint samples from 1862 participants in a 20-year observational study of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular arterial disease (CVAD) conducted by the Fairbanks Institute. The White Blood Cell elastase activity in these patients was assessed using immunoassays for Bikunin and Uristatin. Participants were assigned to four cohorts (healthy, T2D, CV, CV+T2D) based on analysis of their EHRs and the diagnostic biomarkers values and patient status were assessed ten-years post-sample. RESULTS: The IgG-CTF reference range was determined to be 75-821 ng/mL and IgG-CTF out-of-range values did not predict cohort or comorbidity as determined from the EHRs at 10 years after sample collection nor did IgG-CTF demonstrate a significant risk for comorbidity or death. Many patients at sample collection time had other conditions (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or other risk factors) of which only hypertension, Uristatin and Bikunin values correlated with increased risk of developing additional comorbidities (odds ratio 2.58-13.11, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that retrospective analysis of biorepositories coupled with EHRs can establish reference ranges for novel autoimmune diagnostic markers and provide insights into prediction of specific health outcomes and correlations to other markers.","Pugia, Michael JPradhan, MeetaQi, RongEastes, Doreen LVorsilak, AnnaMills, Bradley JBaird, ZaneWijeratne, ArunaMcAhren, Scott MMosley, AmberShekhar, AnanthaRobertson, Daniel H","Pugia MJPradhan MQi REastes DLVorsilak AMills BJBaird ZWijeratne AMcAhren SMMosley AShekhar ARobertson DH","Bioanalytical Research Core, Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, Indianapolis IN, USA.Applied Data Sciences Center, Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, Indianapolis IN, USA.Applied Data Sciences Center, Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, Indianapolis IN, USA.Bioanalytical Research Core, Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, Indianapolis IN, USA.Bioanalytical Research Core, Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, Indianapolis IN, USA.Applied Data Sciences Center, Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, Indianapolis IN, USA.Bioanalytical Research Core, Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, Indianapolis IN, USA.Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis IN, USA.Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis IN, USA.Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis IN, USA.Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis IN, USA.Applied Data Sciences Center, Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, Indianapolis IN, USA.","eng","UL1 TR000006/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States","Journal Article",NA,"United States","Arch Autoimmune Dis","Archives of autoimmune diseases","101772873",NA,NA,NA,"PMC7839988","NIHMS1642267",NA,NA,NA,"2021/01/30 06:00","2021/01/30 06:01","2021/01/27","2021/01/29 05:58","2021/01/29 05:58 [entrez]2021/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]2021/01/30 06:01 [medline]2021/01/27 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.46439/autoimmune.1.004 [doi]","ppublish","Arch Autoimmune Dis. 2020;1(1):17-27. doi: 10.46439/autoimmune.1.004.",NA,NA,NA,"10.46439/autoimmune.1.004",NA,2020

Integrated analysis of the RNA-Seq data and proteomics data indicated that the two DEGs/DEPs-Gck [glucokinase (GCK)] and Cyp4a12a [cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily a, polypeptide 12a (CYP4A12A)]-showed the same trend in mRNA and protein expression levels in the comparison of F31-VS-DC. KEGG analysis revealed that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) signaling pathway was enriched in both of the comparisons of NC-VS-DC and F31-VS-DC at the protein expression level. In the analysis of the gene and protein expression of candidate proteins targeting diabetes, we found that three genes [Gck, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)] and three proteins [GCK, glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2), pyruvate kinase (PYK) ] in the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways, proteins of the Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) in the insulin pathway, and two genes [Cyp4a12a and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 (SCD2)] in the lipid metabolism were expressed significantly differently in the F31-treated group as compared with the DC group, which played important roles in the hypoglycemic activity of F31. Cluster analysis demonstrated that microRNAs probably participated in the regulation of the genes involved the glucose metabolism. These results provide theoretical evidence for F31 as a potential functional food ingredient for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.","Xiao, ChunWu, QingpingXie, YizhenTan, JianbinDing, YinRunBai, Lijuan","Xiao CWu QXie YTan JDing YBai L","State Key Laboratory of Applied Microbiology Southern China, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Microbial Culture Collection and Application, Guangdong Open Laboratory of Applied Microbiology, Guangdong Institute of Microbiology, Guangzhou 510070, China.

The changes in endogenous metabolites in the plasma of high-fat diet-induced dyslipidemia rats treated with Ge Gen Qin Lian Decoction (GGQLD) were studied to elucidate the therapeutic effects and mechanism of action of GGQLD in dyslipidemia. Based on ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS), the metabolic profiles of rat serum samples were collected. The rat model of dyslipidemia was induced by a 60% fat-fed high-fat diet. After feeding the rats with a high-fat diet for 4 weeks, dyslipidemia appeared. After 5 weeks of GGQLD (14.85 g kg(-1)) administration, the metabonomics of rats' plasma samples in the normal group, model group, and administration group were analyzed. Mass profiler professional (MPP), SIMCA-P 14.1, and Graphpad prism 6.0 software were used combined with METLIN biological database and human metabolite database HMDB to screen and identify endogenous biomarkers. Metaboanalyst 4.0 software was used by combining with HMDB and KEGG databases; the enrichment and metabolic pathway of biomarkers were analyzed to explore the metabolic mechanism of dyslipidemia rats induced by high-fat diet and the intervention mechanism of Gegen Qinlian decoction. After 5 weeks of administration of GGQLD, the levels of serum TC and TG were significantly decreased (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), while HDL-C and LDL-C were not significantly affected. After administration, the food intake of rats in the administration group decreased gradually, and the change trend of body weight gradually slowed down. The metabonomics of rat plasma samples results showed that 23 potential biomarkers including α-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, and lysophosphatidylcholine were significantly changed in positive ion mode. Studies have shown that GGQLD has a significant lipid-lowering effect on dyslipidemia rats induced by a high-fat diet, and its preventive mechanism is related to tryptophan metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, α-linolenic acid metabolism, arachidonic acid, and glycerophosphatidyl metabolism pathway.","Xu, ZiweiSheng, YixuanZeng, GuoweiZeng, ZhijunLi, BingtaoJiang, LiXu, GuoliangZhang, Qiyun","Xu ZSheng YZeng GZeng ZLi BJiang LXu GAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-0610-8891Zhang QAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2293-6240","School of Pharmacy, Jiangxi University of Jiangxi Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China.Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of TCM Etiopathogenisis, University of Jiangxi Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China.Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of TCM Etiopathogenisis, University of Jiangxi Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China.Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of TCM Etiopathogenisis, University of Jiangxi Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China.Research Center for Differentiation and Development of Basic Theory of TCM, University of Jiangxi Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China.Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of TCM Etiopathogenisis, University of Jiangxi Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China.Research Center for Differentiation and Development of Basic Theory of TCM, University of Jiangxi Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China.Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of TCM Etiopathogenisis, University of Jiangxi Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China.Research Center for Differentiation and Development of Basic Theory of TCM, University of Jiangxi Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China.Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of TCM Etiopathogenisis, University of Jiangxi Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China.Research Center for Differentiation and Development of Basic Theory of TCM, University of Jiangxi Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China.Jiangxi Province Key Laboratory of TCM Etiopathogenisis, University of Jiangxi Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China.Research Center for Differentiation and Development of Basic Theory of TCM, University of Jiangxi Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20210605","United States","Evid Based Complement Alternat Med","Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM","101215021",NA,NA,NA,"PMC8203394",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare no conflicts of interest.","2021/07/02 06:00","2021/07/02 06:01","2021/06/05","2021/07/01 06:57","2020/11/06 00:00 [received]2021/05/07 00:00 [revised]2021/05/21 00:00 [accepted]2021/07/01 06:57 [entrez]2021/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]2021/07/02 06:01 [medline]2021/06/05 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1155/2021/6692456 [doi]","epublish","Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2021 Jun 5;2021:6692456. doi: 10.1155/2021/6692456. eCollection 2021.","Copyright © 2021 Ziwei Xu et al.",NA,NA,"10.1155/2021/6692456",NA,2021

To further understand the molecular mechanisms that produce this superior drug efficacy of Abr, a quantitative proteomic approach has been applied to investigate the global protein expression profiles of lung cancer cell A549 treated with Abr and PTX. Only one protein, namely, glucosamine 6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase 1 (GNA1), showed significant differential expression (P<0.05) in the cutoff of 2.0 fold, suggesting that Abr can be used safely as a substitute for PTX. GNA1 is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine, which is an important donor substrate for N-linked glycosylation and has several important functions such as embryonic development and growth. Albumin plays a major role in the regulation of this protein. In summary, this study first shows that the superior drug effect of Abr is mainly due to the downregulation of GNA1, which causes proliferative delay and cell adhesion defect. It is also noteworthy that the deficiency of GNA1 might reduce insulin secretion which correlates with type 2 diabetes.","Zhao, MinzhiLi, HaiyunMa, YanGong, HeYang, ShuFang, QiaojunHu, Zhiyuan","Zhao MLi HMa YGong HYang SFang QHu Z","Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing, People's Republic of China.Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing, People's Republic of China.Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing, People's Republic of China.Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing, People's Republic of China.Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing, People's Republic of China.Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing, People's Republic of China.Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory for Biomedical Effects of Nanomaterials and Nanosafety, CAS Center for Excellence in Nanoscience, National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing, People's Republic of China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20170301","New Zealand","Int J Nanomedicine","International journal of nanomedicine","101263847","0 (Actins)0 (Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel)EC 2.3.1.4 (Glucosamine 6-Phosphate N-Acetyltransferase)P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)","IM","A549 CellsActins/metabolismAlbumin-Bound Paclitaxel/*pharmacologyApoptosis/drug effectsBlotting, WesternCarcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*pathologyCell Adhesion/drug effectsCell Proliferation/drug effectsCell Survival/drug effectsChromatography, LiquidGlucosamine 6-Phosphate N-Acetyltransferase/*metabolismHumansIsotope LabelingLung Neoplasms/*pathologyModels, BiologicalNanoparticles/*chemistryPaclitaxel/pharmacologyPolymerizationProteomicsReproducibility of ResultsTandem Mass Spectrometry","PMC5338994",NA,"NOTNLM","abraxanedrug efficacylung cancermolecular mechanismsnano-drugquantitative proteomics","Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.","2017/03/11 06:00","2017/05/10 06:00","2017/03/01","2017/03/11 06:00","2017/03/11 06:00 [entrez]2017/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]2017/05/10 06:00 [medline]2017/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","ijn-12-1685 [pii]10.2147/IJN.S129976 [doi]","epublish","Int J Nanomedicine. 2017 Mar 1;12:1685-1697. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S129976. eCollection 2017.",NA,NA,NA,"10.2147/IJN.S129976",NA,2017

Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these chronic conditions is of relevant importance as it might lead to the identification of novel anti-obesity targets. The purpose of the current study is to investigate differentially expressed proteins between lean and obese subjects through a shot-gun quantitative proteomics approach using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) extracts as well as potential modulation of those proteins by physical exercise. Using this approach, a total of 47 proteins showed at least 1.5 fold change between lean and obese subjects. In obese, the proteomic profiling before and after 3 months of physical exercise showed differential expression of 38 proteins. Thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) was among the proteins that were upregulated in obese subjects and then decreased by physical exercise. Conversely, the histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) was downregulated in obese subjects and then induced by physical exercise. The proteomic data was further validated by qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry in both PBMCs and adipose tissue. We also showed that HDAC4 levels correlated positively with maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 Max) but negatively with body mass index, percent body fat, and the inflammatory chemokine RANTES. In functional assays, our data indicated that ectopic expression of HDAC4 significantly impaired TNF-α-dependent activation of NF-κB, establishing thus a link between HDAC4 and regulation of the immune system. Together, the expression pattern of HDAC4 in obese subjects before and after physical exercise, its correlation with various physical, clinical and metabolic parameters along with its inhibitory effect on NF-κB are suggestive of a protective role of HDAC4 against obesity. HDAC4 could therefore represent a potential therapeutic target for the control and management of obesity and presumably insulin resistance.","Abu-Farha, MohamedTiss, AliAbubaker, JehadKhadir, AbdelkrimAl-Ghimlas, FahadAl-Khairi, IrinaBaturcam, EnginCherian, PreethiElkum, NaserHammad, MahaJohn, JeenaKavalakatt, SinaWarsame, SamiaBehbehani, KazemDermime, SaidDehbi, Mohammed","Abu-Farha MTiss AAbubaker JKhadir AAl-Ghimlas FAl-Khairi IBaturcam ECherian PElkum NHammad MJohn JKavalakatt SWarsame SBehbehani KDermime SDehbi M","Department of Biomedical Research, Dasman Diabetes Institute, Kuwait, Kuwait.","eng",NA,"Comparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20130924","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (CCL5 protein, human)0 (Chemokine CCL5)0 (Repressor Proteins)0 (Thrombospondin 1)EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC4 protein, human)EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)","IM","Adipose Tissue/metabolismBlotting, WesternBody CompositionBody Mass IndexChemokine CCL5/metabolismEpigenesis, Genetic/geneticsExercise/*physiologyGene Expression ProfilingGene Expression Regulation/*physiologyHistone Deacetylases/*metabolismHumansImmunohistochemistryLeukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolismObesity/genetics/*metabolismOxygen Consumption/physiologyProteomics/*methodsReal-Time Polymerase Chain ReactionRepressor Proteins/*metabolismThrombospondin 1/*metabolism","PMC3782461",NA,NA,NA,"Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2013/10/03 06:00","2014/07/08 06:00","2013/09/24","2013/10/03 06:00","2013/05/22 00:00 [received]2013/08/13 00:00 [accepted]2013/10/03 06:00 [entrez]2013/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]2014/07/08 06:00 [medline]2013/09/24 00:00 [pmc-release]","PONE-D-13-20987 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0075342 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2013 Sep 24;8(9):e75342. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0075342. eCollection 2013.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0075342",NA,2013

To study the mechanism(s) by which a HFD impairs glucose tolerance, we used a quantitative proteomic platform that integrated pI-based OFFGEL fractionation and iTRAQ labeling to profile the temporal changes in adipose membrane protein expression in mice fed a HFD for up to 8 months. Within 2 months of starting the diet, the mice adipose and liver tissues accumulated fat droplets, which contributed to subsequent insulin resistance and glucose intolerance within 6 months. The membrane proteomic delineation of such phenotypic expression resulted in quantification of 1713 proteins with 266, 343, and 125 differentially expressed proteins in 2-, 6-, and 8-month HFD-fed versus control mice, respectively. Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed proteins revealed the interplay between upregulation of fatty acid metabolism and downregulation of glucose metabolism. Substantial upregulation of adipose and liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase (Cpt) 1, the rate-limiting enzyme in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria, occurred by 2 months. The increase in hepatic Cpt 1a expression was associated with a progressive decrease in glucose uptake as evidenced by downregulation of the liver glucose transporter protein (Glut) 2. Loss of glycogen storage was found in those hepatocytes full of fat droplets. Intriguingly, skeletal muscle Cpt 1b expression was unaltered by the HFD, whereas skeletal muscle Glut 4 and tyrosine phosphoryated insulin receptor substrate 1 (p-IRS1) were substantially upregulated at the same time as abnormal glucose metabolism developed in adipose and liver tissues. This study defines some of the molecular mechanisms as well as the relationship among adipose tissue, liver and skeletal muscle during development of HFD-induced glucose intolerance in vivo and identifies Cpt 1 as a potential drug target for the control or prevention of diabetes.","Ho, Jennifer HLee, Oscar KFu, Yun-JuShih, Hung-TaTseng, Chien-YuChung, Cheng-ChihHan, Chia-LiChen, Yu-Ju","Ho JHLee OKFu YJShih HTTseng CYChung CCHan CLChen YJ","Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20130131","United States","J Proteome Res","Journal of proteome research","101128775","0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Fatty Acids)0 (Membrane Proteins)","IM","Adipose Tissue/metabolismAnimalsBlood Glucose/metabolismBlotting, WesternChromatography, Liquid*DietFatty Acids/*metabolism*Glucose Tolerance TestImmunohistochemistryMaleMembrane Proteins/metabolismMiceMice, Inbred BALB CPrediabetic State/*metabolism*ProteomicsTandem Mass Spectrometry",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013/01/16 06:00","2013/08/30 06:00",NA,"2013/01/16 06:00","2013/01/16 06:00 [entrez]2013/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]2013/08/30 06:00 [medline]","10.1021/pr300662j [doi]","ppublish","J Proteome Res. 2013 Mar 1;12(3):1120-33. doi: 10.1021/pr300662j.

To search novel obesity-related factors, comparisons of protein expressions between high and low BMI groups were carried out by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Gene transcripts of proteasome subunits found out from 2-DE were further determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Results from proteomics approach showed that the expression of proteasome alpha subunit type 5 (PSMA5) was significantly lower in the high BMI male group than in those with low BMI (P < 0.05). To validate these results, we expanded the study to include 20 more men and used real-time PCR to quantify the mRNA expression level in their EBV-B cells. Both PSMA5 and PSMA2 of EBV-B cells showed negative correlation with BMI.

Selection of the most promising candidates between the initial untargeted step and the subsequent validation phases is critical within the pipeline leading to clinical tests. Several statistical and data mining methods have been described for feature selection: in particular, wrapper approaches iteratively assess the performance of the classifier on distinct subsets of variables. Current wrappers, however, do not estimate the significance of the selected features. We therefore developed a new methodology to find the smallest feature subset which significantly contributes to the model performance, by using a combination of resampling, ranking of variable importance, significance assessment by permutation of the feature values in the test subsets, and half-interval search. We wrapped our biosigner algorithm around three reference binary classifiers (Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines) which have been shown to achieve specific performances depending on the structure of the dataset. By using three real biological and clinical metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets (containing up to 7000 features), complementary signatures were obtained in a few minutes, generally providing higher prediction accuracies than the initial full model. Comparison with alternative feature selection approaches further indicated that our method provides signatures of restricted size and high stability. Finally, by using our methodology to seek metabolites discriminating type 1 from type 2 diabetic patients, several features were selected, including a fragment from the taurochenodeoxycholic bile acid. Our methodology, implemented in the biosigner R/Bioconductor package and Galaxy/Workflow4metabolomics module, should be of interest for both experimenters and statisticians to identify robust molecular signatures from large omics datasets in the process of developing new diagnostics.","Rinaudo, PhilippeBoudah, SamiaJunot, ChristopheThévenot, Etienne A","Rinaudo PBoudah SJunot CThévenot EA","CEA, LIST, Laboratory for Data Analysis and Systems' Intelligence, MetaboHUB Gif-sur-Yvette, France.Laboratoire d'Etude du Métabolisme des Médicaments, DSV/iBiTec-S/SPI, MetaboHUB, CEA-Saclay Gif-sur-Yvette, France.Laboratoire d'Etude du Métabolisme des Médicaments, DSV/iBiTec-S/SPI, MetaboHUB, CEA-Saclay Gif-sur-Yvette, France.CEA, LIST, Laboratory for Data Analysis and Systems' Intelligence, MetaboHUB Gif-sur-Yvette, France.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20160621","Switzerland","Front Mol Biosci","Frontiers in molecular biosciences","101653173",NA,NA,NA,"PMC4914951",NA,"NOTNLM","biomarkerfeature selectionmolecular signatureomics datapartial least squaresrandom forestsupport vector machine",NA,"2016/07/23 06:00","2016/07/23 06:01","2016/01/01","2016/07/23 06:00","2016/12/21 00:00 [received]2016/06/03 00:00 [accepted]2016/07/23 06:00 [entrez]2016/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]2016/07/23 06:01 [medline]2016/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.3389/fmolb.2016.00026 [doi]","epublish","Front Mol Biosci. 2016 Jun 21;3:26. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2016.00026. eCollection 2016.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3389/fmolb.2016.00026",NA,2016

This study investigates the associations between urinary markers of nucleic acid oxidation and Body Mass Index (BMI), age, sex and cardiometabolic risk factors in children and adolescents with and without obesity. METHODS: We studied 543 children and adolescents from an obesity clinic cohort (n = 418) and a population-based cohort (n = 125), all aged 6-18 years. Anthropometrics, urine and blood samples were collected. A validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was used to measure the nucleic acid oxidation markers. RESULTS: Compared with the population-based cohort, children and adolescents in the obesity clinic cohort had higher calculated 24-h excretion of 8-oxoGuo (p = 0.045) and 8-oxodG (p = 0.014) adjusted for basal metabolic rate. Both oxidation markers were positively associated with age and female sex (all p < 0.002). In the obesity clinic cohort the RNA oxidation marker 8-oxoGuo correlated with serum insulin (rho = 0.18, p = <.001) and insulin resistance (rho = 0.19, p = <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood obesity associate with higher urinary excretion of nucleic acid oxidation biomarkers, and increase with age throughout childhood, mirroring the obesity and age-related increase shown in adults. Finally, children with obesity and insulin resistance had higher RNA oxidation markers than children with obesity and no insulin resistance, supporting a possible link between oxidative stress and the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic risk including type 2 diabetes.","Jørs, AnnaLund, Morten A VJespersen, ThomasHansen, TorbenPoulsen, Henrik EHolm, Jens-Christian","Jørs ALund MAVJespersen THansen TPoulsen HEHolm JC","The Children's Obesity Clinic, European Centre of Management (EASO), Department of Pediatrics, Copenhagen University Hospital Holbæk, Holbæk, Denmark; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.The Children's Obesity Clinic, European Centre of Management (EASO), Department of Pediatrics, Copenhagen University Hospital Holbæk, Holbæk, Denmark; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Rats received daily oral doses of xanthohumol at 0, 1.86, 5.64, and 16.9 mg/kg BW for 6 weeks. All rats were maintained on a high fat (60% kcal) AIN-93G diet for 3 weeks to induce severe obesity followed by a normal AIN-93G (15% kcal fat) diet for the last 3 weeks of the study. Weekly food intake and body weight were recorded. Plasma cholesterol, glucose, insulin, triglyceride, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels were assessed using commercial assay kits. Plasma and liver tissue levels of XN and its metabolites were determined by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma and liver tissue levels of xanthohumol were similar between low and medium dose groups and significantly (p<0.05) elevated in the highest dose group. There was a dose-dependent effect on body weight and plasma glucose levels. The highest dose group (n=6) had significantly lower plasma glucose levels compared to the control group (n=6) in male but not female rats. There was also a significant decrease in body weight for male rats in the highest dose group (16.9 mg/kg BW) compared to rats that received no xanthohumol, which was also not seen for female rats.

Erythritol is of medical interest because elevated plasma levels of this polyol are predictive for visceral adiposity gain and development of type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms behind these associations remain unknown because the erythritol biosynthesis pathway, particularly the enzyme catalyzing the final step of erythritol synthesis (reduction of erythrose to erythritol), is not characterized. In this study, we purified two enzymes from rabbit liver capable of catalyzing the conversion of erythrose to erythritol: alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD). Both recombinant human ADH1 and SORD reduce erythrose to erythritol, using NADPH as a co-factor, and cell culture studies indicate that this activity is primarily NADPH-dependent. We found that ADH1 variants vary markedly in both their affinity for erythrose and their catalytic capacity (turnover number). Interestingly, the recombinant protein produced from the ADH1B2 variant, common in Asian populations, is not active when NADPH is used as a co-factor in vitro We also confirmed SORD contributes to intracellular erythritol production in human A549 lung cancer cells, where ADH1 is minimally expressed. In summary, human ADH1 and SORD catalyze the conversion of erythrose to erythritol, pointing to novel roles for two dehydrogenase proteins in human glucose metabolism that may contribute to individual responses to diet.

Since BA alterations are associated with obesity and insulin resistance, plasma BAs have been considered candidates to predict type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. We aimed to determine (1) the association of BAs with glucose homeostasis parameters and (2) their predictive association with the risk of conversion from prediabetes to new-onset diabetes (NOD) in a prospective cohort study. DESIGN: 205 patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) were followed each year during 5 years in the IT-DIAB cohort study. Twenty-one BA species and 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a marker of BA synthesis, were quantified by LC/MS-MS in plasma from fasted patients at baseline. Correlations between plasma BA species and metabolic parameters at baseline were assessed by Spearman's coefficients and the association between BAs and NOD was determined using Cox proportional-hazards models. RESULTS: Among the analyzed BA species, total hyocholic acid (HCA) and the total HCA/total chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) ratio, reflecting hepatic BA 6α-hydroxylation activity, negatively correlated with BMI and HOMA-IR. The total HCA/total CDCA ratio also correlated negatively with HbA(1C). Conversion from IFG to NOD occurred in 33.7% of the participants during the follow-up. Plasma BA species were not independently associated with the conversion to NOD after adjustment with classical T2D risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Fasting plasma BAs are not useful clinical biomarkers for predicting NOD in patients with IFG. However, an unexpected association between 6α-hydroxylated BAs and glucose parameters was found, suggesting a role for this specific BA pathway in metabolic homeostasis.

We used two-dimensional fluorescence differential gel electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry peptide identification and western blot validation in the study. RESULTS: Sixty protein spots were differentially abundant between the non-albuminuric and macro-albuminuric subjects (> 2.5-fold, P < 0.05). In the non-albuminuric subjects, in addition to previously reported α(1) -microglobulin, the next most interesting spot (upregulated 3.44-fold, P = 0.0026) was human zinc-α(2) -glycoprotein, a novel adipose-cytokine associated with glomerular injury.

Yet only half of obese adolescents have IR and far fewer progress to type 2 diabetes mellitus. We hypothesized that amino acid and fatty acid metabolites may serve as biomarkers or determinants of IR in obese teens. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fasting blood samples were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry in 82 obese adolescents. A principal components analysis and multiple linear regression models were used to correlate metabolic components with surrogate measures of IR: homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), adiponectin, and triglyceride (TG) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio. RESULTS: Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) levels and products of BCAA catabolism were higher (P < .01) in males than females with comparable body mass index (BMI) z-score. In multivariate analyses, HOMA-IR in males correlated positively with BMI z-score and a metabolic signature containing BCAA, uric acid, and long-chain acylcarnitines and negatively with byproducts of complete fatty acid oxidation (R(2) = 0.659, P < .0001). In contrast, only BMI z-score correlated with HOMA-IR in females. Adiponectin correlated inversely with BCAA and uric acid (R(2) = 0.268, P = .0212) in males but not females. TG to HDL ratio correlated with BMI z-score and the BCAA signature in females but not males. CONCLUSIONS: BCAA levels and byproducts of BCAA catabolism are higher in obese teenage boys than girls of comparable BMI z-score.

In this study, we performed a proteomic approach to identify differential target proteins underlying diabetes progression in patients with abdominal obesity. Proteomic differences were investigated in the serum of controls and patients with prediabetes or diabetes with or without abdominal obesity by 2-DE combined with MALDI-TOF-MS. Proteomics data were validated by western blot analyses and major protein-protein interactions were assessed using a network analysis with String database. Among 245 matched protein spots, 36 exhibited marked differences in normal patients with abdominal obesity, prediabetes, and diabetes compared to levels in normal patients without abdominal obesity. Seven (Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, Alpha-1-antitrypsin, Apolipoprotein A-I, haptoglobin, retinol-binding protein 4, transthyretin, and zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein) of these spots exhibited significant differences between normal and prediabetes/diabetes patients. After a network analysis, functional annotation using Gene Ontology indicated that most of the identified proteins were involved in lipid transport, lipid localization, and the regulation of serum lipoprotein particle levels. Our results indicated that variation in the levels of these identified protein biomarkers has been reported in normal, prediabetes and diabetic Assessment of the levels of these biomarkers may contribute to the development of biomarkers for not only early diagnosis but also in prognosis of diabetes mellitus type 2.","Kim, Sang WooChoi, Jung-WonYun, Jong WonChung, In-SungCho, Ho ChanSong, Seung-EunIm, Seung-SoonSong, Dae-Kyu","Kim SWChoi JWYun JWChung ISCho HCSong SEIm SSAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2743-2108Song DK","Institute for Bio-Medical Convergence, College of Medicine, Catholic Kwandong University, Gangneung-si, Gangwon-do, South Korea.Catholic Kwandong University, International St. Mary's Hospital, Incheon Metropolitan City, South Korea.Institute for Bio-Medical Convergence, College of Medicine, Catholic Kwandong University, Gangneung-si, Gangwon-do, South Korea.Catholic Kwandong University, International St. Mary's Hospital, Incheon Metropolitan City, South Korea.Department of Biotechnology, Daegu University, Kyungsan, Kyungbuk, South Korea.Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine and Department of Preventive Medicine, Keimyung, University School of Medicine, Daegu, South Korea.Department of Internal Medicine, Keimyung, University School of Medicine, Daegu, South Korea.Department of Physiology and Obesity-mediated Disease Research Center, Keimyung, University School of Medicine, Daegu, South Korea.Department of Physiology and Obesity-mediated Disease Research Center, Keimyung, University School of Medicine, Daegu, South Korea.Department of Physiology and Obesity-mediated Disease Research Center, Keimyung, University School of Medicine, Daegu, South Korea.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20190910","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (AZGP1 protein, human)0 (Adipokines)0 (Apolipoproteins)0 (Biomarkers)0 (Carrier Proteins)0 (Glycoproteins)0 (Haptoglobins)0 (Prealbumin)0 (Proteome)0 (Retinol-Binding Proteins)0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)","IM","AdipokinesAdultApolipoproteins/bloodBiomarkers/bloodCarrier Proteins/bloodDiabetes Mellitus/*blood/diagnosisFemaleGlycoproteins/bloodHaptoglobins/analysisHumansMaleMiddle AgedObesity, Abdominal/*complicationsPrealbumin/analysisProteome/*chemistryRepublic of KoreaRetinol-Binding Proteins/analysisalpha 1-Antitrypsin/blood","PMC6736247",NA,NA,NA,"The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2019/09/11 06:00","2020/03/07 06:00","2019/09/10","2019/09/11 06:00","2019/04/29 00:00 [received]2019/08/20 00:00 [accepted]2019/09/11 06:00 [entrez]2019/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]2020/03/07 06:00 [medline]2019/09/10 00:00 [pmc-release]","PONE-D-19-12075 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0222032 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2019 Sep 10;14(9):e0222032. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0222032. eCollection 2019.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0222032",NA,2019

A previous targeted plasma proteomic study has indicated that ascorbic acid is associated with markers of the immune system in healthy subjects. However, the association between the levels of ascorbic acid and blood biomarkers in subjects at risk of developing T2D is still unknown. Serum ascorbic acid was measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography and serum proteins were quantified by untargeted liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry in 25 hyperinsulinemia subjects that were randomly assigned a high dairy intake diet or an adequate dairy intake diet for 6 weeks, then crossed-over after a 6-week washout period. Spearman correlation followed by gene ontology analyses were performed to identify biological pathways associated with ascorbic acid. Finally, machine learning analysis was performed to obtain a specific serum protein signature that could predict ascorbic acid levels. After adjustments for waist circumference, LDL, HDL, fasting insulin, fasting blood glucose, age, gender, and dairy intake; serum ascorbic acid correlated positively with different aspects of the immune system. Machine learning analysis indicated that a signature composed of 21 features that included 17 proteins (mainly from the immune system), age, sex, waist circumference, and LDL could predict serum ascorbic acid levels in hyperinsulinemia subjects. In conclusion, the result reveals a correlation as well as modulation between serum ascorbic acid levels and proteins that play vital roles in regulating different aspects of the immune response in individuals at risk of T2D. The development of a predictive signature for ascorbic acid will further help the assessment of ascorbic acid status in clinical settings.","Mahdavi, AtenaLeclercq, MickaëlDroit, ArnaudRudkowska, IwonaLebel, Michel","Mahdavi ALeclercq MDroit ARudkowska ILebel M","Endocrinology and Nephrology Unit, CHU de Québec-Laval University Research Center, Québec, Canada.Endocrinology and Nephrology Unit, CHU de Québec-Laval University Research Center, Québec, Canada.Endocrinology and Nephrology Unit, CHU de Québec-Laval University Research Center, Québec, Canada; Proteomics Platform, Centre de recherche du CHU de Québec, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, Canada.Endocrinology and Nephrology Unit, CHU de Québec-Laval University Research Center, Québec, Canada; Department of Kinesiology, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, Canada.

Thus, more investigations into new DN-related biomarkers are needed. METHODS: We employed urinary proteomic approach of fluorescence-based difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) and mass spectrometry to identify novel biomarkers in urine samples, which were from type 2 diabetes patients with normoalbuminuria (DM group), microalbuminuria (DN1 group), macroalbuminuria (DN2 group) and control group (n=8 in each group). The identified biomarker was further studied by western blot in urine samples (n=6 in each group) and immunohistochemistry in renal biopsies. Besides, the urinary level of biomarker was detected and analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) method (n=40 in each group). RESULTS: A novel DN-related biomarker, urinary E-cadherin, was identified by proteomic methods, which up-regulated 1.3-fold, 5.2-fold and 8.5-fold in DM, DN1 and DN2 groups compared with control group. Meanwhile, high expression of urinary soluble 80 kDa fragment of E-cadherin (sE-cadherin) was verified in DN groups by western blot. The ELISA data also demonstrated that urinary sE-cadherin-to-creatinine ratio was significantly increased in DN1 and DN2 groups versus DM group or control group (2751.5+/-164 and 5839.6+/-428 vs 721.9+/-93 or 652.7+/-87 microg/g; p<0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of urinary sE-cadherin for diagnosis of DN were calculated as 78.8% (95% CI, 74-83%) and 80% (95% CI, 65-91%). Besides, immunohistochemical stain showed that E-cadherin expression was markedly decreased in renal tubular epithelial cells of patients with DN versus healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary sE-cadherin has a potential clinical diagnostic value for DN and E-cadherin may participate in the pathogenesis of DN.","Jiang, HongjuanGuan, GuangjuZhang, RuiLiu, GangCheng, JingHou, XianghuaCui, Yazhou","Jiang HGuan GZhang RLiu GCheng JHou XCui Y","Department of Nephrology, The Second Hospital of Shandong University, 247 Beiyuan Road, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"England","Diabetes Metab Res Rev","Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews","100883450","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Cadherins)","IM","AdultAgedAlbuminuria/urineBiomarkers/*urineBlotting, WesternCadherins/*urineDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*urineDiabetic Nephropathies/diagnosis/*urineElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-DimensionalEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent AssayFemaleHumansImmunohistochemistryKidney/metabolismMaleMiddle AgedProteomicsSensitivity and SpecificitySolubilitySpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2009/01/30 09:00","2009/05/22 09:00",NA,"2009/01/30 09:00","2009/01/30 09:00 [entrez]2009/01/30 09:00 [pubmed]2009/05/22 09:00 [medline]","10.1002/dmrr.940 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes Metab Res Rev. 2009 Mar;25(3):232-41. doi: 10.1002/dmrr.940.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1002/dmrr.940",NA,2009

An unbiased proteomic screen was used to identify targets of palmitate in beta-cell death. The most significantly altered protein in both human islets and MIN6 beta-cells treated with palmitate was carboxypeptidase E (CPE). Palmitate reduced CPE protein levels within 2 h, preceding endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death, by a mechanism involving CPE translocation to Golgi and lysosomal degradation. Palmitate metabolism and Ca(2+) flux were also required for CPE proteolysis and beta-cell death. Chronic palmitate exposure increased the ratio of proinsulin to insulin. CPE null islets had increased apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Reducing CPE by approximately 30% using shRNA also increased ER stress and apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of CPE partially rescued beta-cells from palmitate-induced ER stress and apoptosis. Thus, carboxypeptidase E degradation contributes to palmitate-induced beta-cell ER stress and apoptosis.

In this study, we analyzed the fasting NEFA profiles of normoglycemic individuals at risk for T2D (women with a recent history of gestational diabetes (GDM)) in comparison to controls (women after a normoglycemic pregnancy). We also examined the associations of NEFA species with overweight/obesity, body fat distribution and insulin sensitivity. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Using LC-MS/MS, we analyzed 41 NEFA species in the fasting sera of 111 women (62 post-GDM, 49 controls). Clinical characterization included a five-point oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), biomarkers and anthropometrics, magnetic resonance imaging (n = 62) and a food frequency questionnaire. Nonparametric tests with Bonferroni correction, binary logistic regression analyses and rank correlations were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Women after GDM had a lower molar percentage of total saturated fatty acids (SFA; 38.55% vs. 40.32%, p = 0.0002) than controls. At an explorative level of significance several NEFA species were associated with post-GDM status (with and without adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and HbA1c): The molar percentages of 14:0, 16:0, 18:0 and 18:4 were reduced, whereas those of 18:1, 18:2, 20:2, 24:4, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and total n-6 NEFA were increased. BMI and the amount of body fat correlated inversely with several SFA and MUFA and positively with various PUFA species over the whole study cohort (abs(ρ)≥0.3 for all). 14:0 was inversely and BMI-independently associated with abdominal visceral adiposity. We saw no correlations of NEFA species with insulin sensitivity and the total NEFA concentration was similar in the post-GDM and the control group. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found alterations in the fasting NEFA profile associated with a recent history of gestational diabetes, a risk marker for T2D. NEFA composition also varied with overweight/obesity and with body fat distribution, but not with insulin sensitivity.","Fugmann, MarinaUhl, OlafHellmuth, ChristianHetterich, HolgerKammer, Nora NFerrari, UtaParhofer, Klaus GKoletzko, BertholdSeissler, JochenLechner, Andreas","Fugmann MUhl OHellmuth CHetterich HKammer NNFerrari UParhofer KGKoletzko BSeissler JLechner A","Diabetes Research Group, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany; Clinical Cooperation Group Type 2 Diabetes, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Munich, Germany; German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Munich, Germany.Division of Metabolic and Nutritional Medicine, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany.Division of Metabolic and Nutritional Medicine, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany.Institute for Clinical Radiology, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany.Institute for Clinical Radiology, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany.Diabetes Research Group, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany; Clinical Cooperation Group Type 2 Diabetes, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Munich, Germany; German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Munich, Germany.Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany.Division of Metabolic and Nutritional Medicine, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany.Diabetes Research Group, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany; Clinical Cooperation Group Type 2 Diabetes, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Munich, Germany; German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Munich, Germany.Diabetes Research Group, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Universität München, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany; Clinical Cooperation Group Type 2 Diabetes, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Munich, Germany; German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Munich, Germany.","eng",NA,"Clinical StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20150526","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Fatty Acids)","IM","AdultBiomarkers/bloodDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/diagnostic imagingDiabetes, Gestational/*blood/diagnostic imagingFatty Acids/*bloodFemaleHumans*Insulin ResistanceMagnetic Resonance ImagingObesity/*blood/diagnostic imagingPregnancyRadiography","PMC4444334",NA,NA,NA,"Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2015/05/27 06:00","2016/04/22 06:00","2015/05/26","2015/05/27 06:00","2014/12/12 00:00 [received]2015/04/21 00:00 [accepted]2015/05/27 06:00 [entrez]2015/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]2016/04/22 06:00 [medline]2015/05/26 00:00 [pmc-release]","PONE-D-14-55797 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0128001 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2015 May 26;10(5):e0128001. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0128001. eCollection 2015.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0128001",NA,2015

Protein profiling of INS-1E cells was done by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis, covering the pH ranges 4-7 and 6-9 (n = 4). Differentially expressed proteins (P < 0.05) were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF and proteomic results were confirmed by functional assays. High glucose levels impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and decreased insulin content. 2D-DIGE analysis revealed 100 differentially expressed proteins that were involved in different pathways. Chaperone proteins were down-regulated, protein biosynthesis and ubiquitin-related proteasomal degradation were attenuated and perturbations in intracellular trafficking and vesicle transport and secretion could be observed. Moreover, several pathways were confirmed by functional assays and a direct role for eEF2 in insulin biosynthesis was demonstrated.

The ability of β-cells to proliferate upon certain stimuli, such as elevated glucose concentration, is an essential property to overpass a major problem of the pathology: the decrease of β-cell mass leading to a lack of insulin production. However, high glucose concentrations are also an inducer of β-cell dysfunction, when proliferation become unable to overcome insulin demand. The control of β-cell proliferation could represent an interesting target for the development of therapeutic molecules for type 2 diabetes treatment. To get new insights on β-cell replication, we investigated the modulation of nuclear proteins of INS-1E cells submitted to medium and high glucose concentrations for 24h. Indeed, the nucleus should contain proteins responsible of proliferation-related events. The SILAC approach allowed us identifying 24 nuclear proteins whose expressions were modified by chronic high glucose. A wide Downstream Effects Analysis assigned the majority of the differentially expressed proteins to functions such as proliferation and cell cycle. Interestingly, our study linked for the first time the increase of expression of the 6 MCM components to glucose-induced stimulation in β-cells. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The current study represents a progress in the understanding of glucose-induced proliferation mechanisms in β-cells. We applied the SILAC strategy to INS-1E cells cultivated with medium or high glucose concentrations for 24h, and we targeted nuclear proteins which have a central role in proliferation-related mechanisms. It allows quantifying 24 nuclear proteins, which are regulated by high glucose exposure. The vast majority of them are shown to be related to proliferation and cell cycle. We describe here for the first time than the 6 proteins of the MCM complex are involved in glucose-mediated proliferation in β-cells.","Schvartz, DomitilleCouté, YohannSanchez, Jean-Charles","Schvartz DCouté YSanchez JC","Translational Biomarker Group, Department of Human Protein Sciences, University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland.INSERM, U1038, Grenoble F-38054, France; CEA, iRTSV, Biologie à Grande Echelle, Grenoble F-38054, France; Université Grenoble-Alpes, Grenoble F-38000, France.Translational Biomarker Group, Department of Human Protein Sciences, University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland.

In type 2 diabetes (T2D), β-cells under these conditions eventually fail. Rare β-cell diseases like congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) also cause inappropriate insulin secretion, and some HI patients develop diabetes. However, the mechanisms of insulin hypersecretion and how it causes β-cell dysfunction are not fully understood. We previously discovered small molecules (e.g. SW016789) that cause insulin hypersecretion and lead to a loss in β-cell function without cell death. Here, we uncover the protein target of SW016789 and provide the first time-course transcriptomic analysis of hypersecretory responses versus thapsigargin-mediated ER stress in β-cells. In mouse MIN6 and human EndoC-βH1 β-cells, we identified and validated VDAC1 as a SW016789 target using photoaffinity proteomics, cellular thermal shift assays, siRNA, and small molecule inhibitors. SW016789 raises membrane potential to enhance Ca (2+) influx, potentially through VDAC1. Chronically elevated intracellular Ca (2+) appears to underpin the negative impacts of hypersecretion, as nifedipine protected against each small molecule hypersecretion inducer we tested. Using time course RNAseq, we discovered that hypersecretion induced a distinct transcriptional pattern compared to ER stress. Clustering analyses led us to focus on ER-associated degradation (ERAD) as a potential mediator of the adaptive response. SW016789 reduced the abundance of ERAD substrate OS-9 and pharmacological inhibition of ERAD worsened β-cell survival in response to hypersecretory stress. Changes in other ERAD components in MIN6 and EndoC-βH1 at the protein level were minor with either SW016789 or thapsigargin. However, immunostaining for core ERAD components SEL1L, HRD1, and DERL3 in non-diabetic and T2D human pancreas revealed altered distributions of SEL1L/HRD1 and SEL1L/DERL3 rations in β-cells of T2D islets, in alignment with altered ERAD in stressed β-cells. We conclude that hypersecretory stimuli, including SW016789mediated VDAC1 activation, cause enhanced Ca (2+) influx and insulin release. Subsequent differential gene expression represents a β-cell hypersecretory response signature that is reflected at the protein level for some, but not all genes. A better understanding of how β-cells induce hypersecretion and the mechanisms of negative feedback on secretory rate may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for T2D and HI.","Roy, GitanjaliOrdóñez, AndreaBinns, Derk DRodrigues Dos Santos, KarinaKwakye, Michael BKing, George CMukherjee, NoyonikaTemplin, Andrew TTan, ZhiyongRichardson, Timothy IDoud, Emma HMosley, Amber LEmfinger, Christopher HAttie, Alan DKeller, Mark PJohnson, Travis SKalwat, Michael A","Roy GAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9622-0184Ordóñez ABinns DDAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4949-3507Rodrigues Dos Santos KAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-3012-7171Kwakye MBKing GCAUID ORCID: 0009-0007-9809-0989Mukherjee NAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6692-3631Templin ATAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6241-9304Tan ZAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-7696-113XRichardson TIAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1119-2752Doud EHAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-0049-0073Mosley ALAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5822-2894Emfinger CHAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9130-4194Attie ADAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-0568-2261Keller MPAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7405-5552Johnson TSAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4628-2256Kalwat MAAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8349-9470",NA,"eng",NA,"Journal ArticlePreprint","20241226","United States","bioRxiv","bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology","101680187",NA,NA,NA,"PMC11703184",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2025/01/07 10:53","2025/01/07 10:54","2025/01/06","2025/01/07 04:32","2025/01/07 10:54 [medline]2025/01/07 10:53 [pubmed]2025/01/07 04:32 [entrez]2025/01/06 00:00 [pmc-release]","2024.12.26.629558 [pii]10.1101/2024.12.26.629558 [doi]","epublish","bioRxiv [Preprint]. 2024 Dec 26:2024.12.26.629558. doi: 10.1101/2024.12.26.629558.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1101/2024.12.26.629558","2024.12.26.629558",2024

Although previous research has explored associations between plasma proteins and CLL, the causal relationships remain unclear. This study used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationship between 7156 plasma proteins and CLL risk. METHODS: A two-sample MR analysis assessed the impact of specific plasma proteins on CLL risk, using data from the Finngen Proteomics project (analyzing 828 participants) and the UK Biobank. Additional analyses included colocalization, phenomenon-wide MR, and protein-protein interaction networks. RESULTS: The study identified nine plasma proteins significantly associated with CLL risk. Increased levels of Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase E (PPIE) (OR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.22-2.27, P = 0.001) were associated with an increased risk of developing CLL, whereas Protein O-Mannosyltransferase 2 (POMGNT2) (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.91, P = 0.017) and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 14(CCL14) (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.67-0.94, P = 0.010) were associated with a reduced risk of CLL. Colocalization analysis suggested that PPIE may share pathogenic variants with CLL (PP.H4 = 0.758). Phenomenon-wide MR analysis of PPIE also indicated associations with other clinical features, including rheumatic diseases and type 2 diabetes. Protein-protein interaction and drug-gene interaction analyses highlighted CDC5L and SNW1 as potential therapeutic targets. CONCLUSION: This study identifies nine plasma proteins linked to CLL risk, with PPIE offering new insights into the disease's pathogenesis. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore their potential as therapeutic targets.","Jin, ChangyuLu, ZehongChen, YuzhanHu, HuijieZhou, MiaoZhang, YanliOuyang, GuifangLi, TongyuSheng, Lixia","Jin CLu ZChen YHu HZhou MZhang YOuyang GLi TSheng L","Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, No.59 Liu-Ting Road, Ningbo, 315000, People's Republic of China.Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, No.59 Liu-Ting Road, Ningbo, 315000, People's Republic of China.Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, No.59 Liu-Ting Road, Ningbo, 315000, People's Republic of China.Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, No.59 Liu-Ting Road, Ningbo, 315000, People's Republic of China.Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, No.59 Liu-Ting Road, Ningbo, 315000, People's Republic of China.Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, No.59 Liu-Ting Road, Ningbo, 315000, People's Republic of China.Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, No.59 Liu-Ting Road, Ningbo, 315000, People's Republic of China. nbhematology@163.com.Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, No.59 Liu-Ting Road, Ningbo, 315000, People's Republic of China. litongyu@zju.edu.cn.Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Ningbo University, No.59 Liu-Ting Road, Ningbo, 315000, People's Republic of China. slx800408@163.com.","eng","2023J384/Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo Municipality/","Journal Article","20250103","United States","Discov Oncol","Discover oncology","101775142",NA,NA,NA,"PMC11699013",NA,"NOTNLM","Chronic lymphocytic leukemiaColocalizationFinnGenMendelian randomizationPlasma proteins","Declarations.

Its molecular mechanisms are not completely understood. The aim of this study is to identify new suspect proteins involved in pancreatic β-cell death induction by saturated fatty acids and its inhibition by unsaturated fatty acids. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Employing 2DE analysis and subsequent western blot confirmation, the differences in membrane/membrane-associated protein expression in human β-cell line NES2Y are assessed during cell death induction by stearate and its inhibition by oleate. RESULTS: Induction of apoptosis by stearate is associated with significantly increased levels of Hsp90β, peroxiredoxin-1, and 14-3-3γ in the membrane fraction of NES2Y cells and significantly decreased levels of annexin A2, annexin A4, and reticulocalbin-2. All these changes are significantly inhibited by oleate co-application. No expression changes are detected after application of stearate together with oleate. Furthermore, the expression of reticulocalbin-2 is significantly decreased after stearate application also in the whole cell lysate. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Several membrane-associated proteins that could be related to pro and anti-apoptotic signaling initiated by fatty acids in human pancreatic β-cells are identified. As far as we know, annexin A4, reticulocalbin-2, and 14-3-3γ represent novel molecules related to the effect of fatty acids on β-cell viability.","Němcová-Fürstová, VlastaBalušíková, KamilaHalada, PetrPavlíková, NelaŠrámek, JanKovář, Jan","Němcová-Fürstová VAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2296-3540Balušíková KHalada PPavlíková NŠrámek JKovář J","Department of Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology & Center for Research of Diabetes, Metabolism and Nutrition, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.Department of Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology & Center for Research of Diabetes, Metabolism and Nutrition, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.Laboratory of Molecular Structure Characterization, Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.Department of Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology & Center for Research of Diabetes, Metabolism and Nutrition, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.Department of Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology & Center for Research of Diabetes, Metabolism and Nutrition, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.Department of Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology & Center for Research of Diabetes, Metabolism and Nutrition, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20190131","Germany","Proteomics Clin Appl","Proteomics.

Plasma proteomic analyses can contribute to identification of proteins associated with changes in BMD. This may be especially informative in stages of bone accrual and peak BMD achievement (i.e., adolescence and young adulthood), but existing research has focused on older adults. This analysis in the Study of Latino Adolescents at Risk for Type 2 Diabetes (SOLAR; n = 304; baseline age 8-13, 100% Hispanic) explored associations between baseline proteins (n = 653 proteins) measured with Olink® plasma protein profiling and repeated annual DXA measures of BMD (average of 3.2 visits per participant). Covariate-adjusted linear mixed effect regression models were applied to estimate longitudinal protein-BMD associations using an adjusted p-value cutoff (P < 0.00068). Identified proteins were imported into the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database to determine significantly enriched protein pathways. Forty-four proteins, many of which are involved in inflammatory processes, were associated with longitudinal changes in total body BMD, including several proteins previously linked to bone health such as osteopontin (SPP1) and microfibrillar-associated protein 5 (MFAP5; both P < 0.00068). These 44 proteins were associated with enrichment of pathways including PI3K-Akt Signaling Pathway and Cytokine-Cytokine Receptor Interaction, supporting results from existing proteomics analyses in older adults. To evaluate whether protein associations were consistent into young adulthood, linear mixed effect models were repeated in a young adult cohort (n = 169; baseline age 17-22; 62.1% Hispanic) with 346 available overlapping Olink® protein measures. While there were no significant overlapping longitudinal protein associations between the cohorts, these findings suggest differences in protein regulation at different ages and provide novel insight on longitudinal protein associations with BMD in overweight/obese adolescents and young adults of primarily Hispanic origin, which may inform the development of biomarkers for bone health in youth.","Beglarian, EmilyChen, Jiawen CarmenLi, ZhenjiangCostello, ElizabethWang, HongxuHampson, HaileyAlderete, Tanya LChen, ZhanghuaValvi, DamaskiniRock, SarahChen, WuRianon, NahidAung, Max TGilliland, Frank DGoran, Michael IMcConnell, RobEckel, Sandrah PLee, MiryoungConti, David VGoodrich, Jesse AChatzi, Lida","Beglarian EAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-3578-4437Chen JCLi ZCostello EWang HHampson HAlderete TLChen ZValvi DRock SChen WRianon NAung MTGilliland FDGoran MIMcConnell REckel SPLee MConti DVGoodrich JAAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6615-0472Chatzi L","Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Environmental Medicine and Climate Science, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Internal Medicine, UTHealth McGovern Medical School, Houston, TX, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, The Saban Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Epidemiology, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, School of Public Health, Brownsville, TX, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.Department of Population and Public Health Sciences, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.","eng","R01 ES036253/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States","Journal Article","20250114","England","J Bone Miner Res","Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research","8610640",NA,"IMOAB  Proteins are heavily involved in the formation of bone and maintenance of bone health over the life span. In this study, we examined associations between >650 proteins and annual measures of bone mineral density (BMD) in overweight/obese Hispanic adolescents. Proteins that were associated with BMD over time were imported into a database that recognizes pathways that the proteins are involved in, allowing us to identify pathways linked with changes in BMD in these adolescents. We found that proteins and pathways primarily involved in inflammation were associated with BMD over the study follow-up period. Several of these pathways have also been associated with bone health in studies on older adults. Additionally, we examined associations between >340 of the same proteins and BMD in a separate sample of young adults, and found that several proteins had similar negative associations with BMD in the two groups. This is the known first study looking at the associations between proteins and BMD in a younger population, as the existing studies of this type were focused on older adults. Additionally, this is one of the first studies that evaluates these associations over years of follow-up, since most studies looked at associations at one time point only.OABL eng",NA,NA,NA,"NOTNLM","Dxabiochemical markers of bone turnovercytokinesgeneral population studiesosteoimmunology",NA,"2025/01/14 18:21","2025/01/14 18:21",NA,"2025/01/14 13:52","2024/07/11 00:00 [received]2024/12/16 00:00 [revised]2025/01/14 18:21 [medline]2025/01/14 18:21 [pubmed]2025/01/14 13:52 [entrez]","7954097 [pii]10.1093/jbmr/zjaf002 [doi]","aheadofprint","J Bone Miner Res. 2025 Jan 14:zjaf002. doi: 10.1093/jbmr/zjaf002.","© The Author(s) 2025.

Epidemiologically, it has been suggested that green tea consumption prevents type 2 diabetes. The present study was aimed at providing evidence of improvement in glucose metabolism in diabetic mice and healthy humans upon green tea consumption. RESULTS: Green tea promoted glucose metabolism in healthy human volunteers at 1.5 g/body in oral glucose tolerance tests. Green tea also lowered blood glucose levels in diabetic db+/db+ mice and streptozotocin-diabetic mice 2-6 h after administration at 300 mg/kg without affecting serum insulin level, whereas no effect was observed in control mice (+m/+m and normal ddY mice). The serum protein profiles of db+/db+ and +m/+m mice were analyzed for the first time by SELDI (surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization)-TOF (time-of-flight)-MS (mass spectrometry), and then compared to investigate any effects of oral green tea administration on serum proteins. The protein profiles in db+/db+ mice showed that the spectral peak intensities at the mass/charge ratios (m/z) of 4119, 4203, 4206, 4211, 4579, 9311 and 18691 were >3 times lower, and those of 13075, 17406, 17407, 17418, 17622, 18431 and 26100 were >3 times higher than respective peak intensities in +m/+m mice. When green tea was administered to db+/db+ mice, the peak intensities were markedly decreased at m/z 11651 and 11863, and slightly decreased at m/z 4212. The peak intensities at 7495, 7595, 7808, 14983, 15614, 31204 were markedly increased after the administration. CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that green tea has an antidiabetic effect. Although we could not find simple reversed effect of green tea on the diabetes-induced modifications of the levels of several serum proteins, we found that the 4211 (4212) Da protein level that was decreased in the diabetic state was further decreased after green tea administration. This is the first report demonstrating that a certain serum protein may be involved in the antihyperglycemic effect of green tea. The contribution of this protein should be further studied.","Tsuneki, HiroshiIshizuka, MitsuyoTerasawa, MikiWu, Jin-BinSasaoka, ToshiyasuKimura, Ikuko","Tsuneki HIshizuka MTerasawa MWu JBSasaoka TKimura I","Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Toyama 930-0194, Japan. htsuneki@ms.toyama-mpu.ac.jp","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20040826","England","BMC Pharmacol","BMC pharmacology","100967806","0 (Blood Glucose)0 (Blood Proteins)0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)0 (Insulin)0 (Plant Preparations)0 (Proteome)","IM","AnimalsBeverages/classificationBlood Glucose/*drug effectsBlood ProteinsCamellia sinensis/*chemistryDiabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*bloodDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*bloodDisease Models, AnimalGlucose Tolerance Test/methodsHypoglycemic Agents/metabolismInsulin/bloodMaleMiceMice, Inbred C57BLPhytotherapy/*methodsPlant Preparations/*pharmacologyProteome/*metabolism","PMC517497",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2004/08/28 05:00","2005/05/17 09:00","2004/08/26","2004/08/28 05:00","2004/06/04 00:00 [received]2004/08/26 00:00 [accepted]2004/08/28 05:00 [pubmed]2005/05/17 09:00 [medline]2004/08/28 05:00 [entrez]2004/08/26 00:00 [pmc-release]","1471-2210-4-18 [pii]10.1186/1471-2210-4-18 [doi]","epublish","BMC Pharmacol. 2004 Aug 26;4:18. doi: 10.1186/1471-2210-4-18.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2004

Bariatric/metabolic surgeries, including laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), provide an avenue for exploring the potential key factors involved in maintaining glucose homeostasis since these surgeries have shown promising results in improving glycemic control among patients with severe type 2 diabetes (T2D). For the first time, a markedly altered population of serum proteins in patients after LSG was discovered and analyzed through proteomics. Apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) was revealed to be increased dramatically in diabetic obese patients following LSG, and a similar effect was observed in patients after RYGB surgery. Moreover, recombinant apoA-IV protein treatment was proven to enhance insulin secretion in isolated human islets. These results showed that apoA-IV may play a crucial role in glycemic control in humans, potentially through enhancing insulin secretion in human islets. ApoA-IV was further shown to enhance energy expenditure and improve glucose tolerance in diabetic rodents, through stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells, partially via Gαs-coupled GPCR/cAMP (G protein-coupled receptor/cyclic adenosine monophosphate) signaling. Furthermore, T55-121, truncated peptide 55-121 of apoA-IV, was discovered to mediate the function of apoA-IV. These collective findings contribute to our understanding of the relationship between apoA-IV and glycemic control, highlighting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target in managing and improving glucose regulation.","Cao, ZhenLei, LeiZhou, ZiyunXu, ShimengWang, LinlinGong, WeikangZhang, QiPan, BinZhang, GaoxinYuan, QuanCui, LiujuanZheng, MinXu, TaoWang, YouZhang, ShuyanLiu, Pingsheng","Cao ZLei LZhou ZXu SWang LGong WZhang QPan BZhang GYuan QCui LZheng MAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6159-9879Xu TWang YZhang SLiu P","National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.The State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China.Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine, University of Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette 4362, Luxembourg.National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory (Bioland Laboratory), Guangzhou, Guangdong 510005, China.Department of Computer Science, School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117417, Singapore.National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan 646000, China.School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan 646000, China.National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.The State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China.National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory (Bioland Laboratory), Guangzhou, Guangdong 510005, China.National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Institute of Infectious Diseases, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China.Beijing Institute of Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100015, China.National Center for Infectious Diseases, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China.National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Tracking and Forecasting for Infectious Diseases, Beijing 100015, China.National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, CAS Center for Excellence in Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240314","England","Life Metab","Life metabolism","9918471185006676",NA,NA,NA,"PMC11748984",NA,"NOTNLM","apolipoprotein A-IVbariatric/metabolic surgeriesglucose toleranceglucose-stimulated insulin secretionhuman isletsproteomics","P.L. holds the position of Editorial Board Member for Life Metabolism and is blinded from reviewing or making decisions for the manuscript.

To understand the mechanisms and identify potential biomarkers related to prediabetes trajectories, we compared the proteomics and metabolomics profile of people with prediabetes progressing to diabetes or reversing to normoglycemia within 1 year. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The fasting plasma concentrations of 1,389 proteins and the fasting, 30-min, and 120-min post-oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma concentrations of 152 metabolites were measured in up to 134 individuals with new-onset diabetes, prediabetes, or normal glucose tolerance. For 108 participants, the analysis was repeated with samples from 1 year before, when all had prediabetes. RESULTS: The plasma concentrations of 14 proteins were higher in diabetes compared with normoglycemia in a population with prediabetes 1 year before, and they correlated with indices of insulin sensitivity. Higher levels of dicarbonyl/L-xylulose reductase and glutathione S-transferase A3 in the prediabetic state were associated with an increased risk of diabetes 1 year later. Pathway analysis pointed toward differences in immune response between diabetes and normoglycemia that were already recognizable in the prediabetic state 1 year prior at baseline. The area under the curve during OGTT of the concentrations of IDL particles, IDL apolipoprotein B, and IDL cholesterol was higher in new-onset diabetes compared with normoglycemia. The concentration of glutamate increased in prediabetes progressing to diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: We identify new candidates associated with the progression of prediabetes to diabetes or its remission to normoglycemia. Pathways regulating the immune response are related to prediabetes trajectories.","Barovic, MarkoHahn, Joke JohannaHeinrich, AnnettAdhikari, TrishlaSchwarz, PeterMirtschink, PeterFunk,

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) was a randomized clinical trial evaluating the cardiovascular (CV) safety and efficacy of once-weekly exenatide for patients with T2D. Candidate biomarker data were selected from proteomic profiling performed at baseline and 12 months after randomization samples by SomaScan assay in 5,473 trial participants. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (major cardiovascular events [MACE]). Cox proportional hazards models controlling for confounders were used for time-to-event analyses to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CI for a 1 SD increase in the biomarker concentrations. RESULTS: The primary outcome occurred in 813 participants (14.9%). Higher levels of osteoprotegerin (HR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03-1.20; P = 0.0047) and osteopontin (HR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02-1.18; P = 0.0095) were associated with an increased risk of MACE. The addition of osteoprotegerin and osteopontin to a clinical predictive model containing traditional CV risk factors provided minimal incremental value for MACE prediction (C-index 0.629 vs. 0.638; likelihood ratio test P < 0.001). Osteocalcin and sclerostin were not associated with MACE. Osteocalcin had a nonlinear association with all-cause death and with CV death. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of osteoprotegerin and osteopontin are associated with an increased risk of CV events in people with T2D, supporting the hypothesis that pathways involved in bone metabolism play a role in CV disease.","Maddaloni, ErnestoNguyen, MaggieShah, Svati HHolman, Rury R","Maddaloni EAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3844-9463Nguyen MShah SHHolman RR","Experimental Medicine Department, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.Diabetes Trials Unit, Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K.Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC.Diabetes Trials Unit, Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K.","eng","Amylin Pharmaceuticals/","Journal ArticleRandomized Controlled Trial",NA,"United States","Diabetes Care","Diabetes care","7805975","106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)0 (Osteoprotegerin)104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Humans*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolism/blood/drug therapy/complications*Osteopontin/blood/metabolismMale*Osteoprotegerin/blood/metabolismFemaleMiddle Aged*Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/mortality*Osteocalcin/blood/metabolismAgedBiomarkers/blood/metabolism",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024/11/22 18:16","2025/01/22 18:25",NA,"2024/11/22 12:32","2024/07/15 00:00 [received]2024/10/30 00:00 [accepted]2025/01/22 18:25 [medline]2024/11/22 18:16 [pubmed]2024/11/22 12:32 [entrez]","157532 [pii]10.2337/dc24-1455 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes Care. 2025 Feb 1;48(2):235-242. doi: 10.2337/dc24-1455.","© 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.",NA,NA,"10.2337/dc24-1455",NA,2025

However, whether adipsin has any independent association with risk factors and biomarkers in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains elusive. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed an oral glucose tolerance test on a subset of 43 patients with T2D from the community health cohort to access the role of adipsin in insulin secretion. We further cross-sectionally examined the role of adipsin in plasma, adipose tissue (AT), and secretion in a community cohort of 353 subjects and a hospital cohort of 52 subjects. RESULTS: We found that plasma adipsin has no significant correlation with insulin secretion in people with diabetes. Among the risk factors of T2D, adipsin levels were independently associated only with age, and a positive correlation between plasma adipsin and age among subjects without T2D was lost in patients with T2D. Plasma adipsin levels, AT adipsin expression, and secretion were upregulated both in T2D and aging, with a corresponding drop in Homeostatic Model Assessment for assessing β-cell function. Adipsin expression was positively associated with other aging biomarkers, such as β-galactosidase, p21, and p16. These results also corroborated with existing plasma proteomic signatures of aging, including growth, and differentiation factor-15, which strongly correlated with adipsin. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate an increase in circulating adipsin in T2D and aging, and it scores as a candidate plasma marker for aging specifically in non-T2D population.","Maity, Sujay KrishnaDas Sharma, AvinilSarkar, JitChaudhuri, TamonashTantia, OmChakrabarti, Partha","Maity SKAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-0621-4849Das Sharma ASarkar JAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9964-6287Chaudhuri TTantia OChakrabarti PAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9502-8695","Cell Biology and Physiology, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India.CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.Cell Biology and Physiology, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.Department of Minimal Access & Bariatric Surgery, ILS Hospitals, Kolkata, India.Department of Minimal Access & Bariatric Surgery, ILS Hospitals, Kolkata, India.Cell Biology and Physiology, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, West Bengal, India pchakrabarti@iicb.res.in.Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240829","England","BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care","BMJ open diabetes research & care","101641391","EC 3.4.21.46 (Complement Factor D)0 (Biomarkers)EC 3.4.21.46 (CFD protein, human)0 (Insulin)","IM","Humans*Complement Factor D/metabolism/analysisMaleFemale*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolism/bloodMiddle Aged*Biomarkers/analysis/blood*Aging/metabolismCross-Sectional Studies*Adipose Tissue/metabolismAgedAdultGlucose Tolerance TestRisk FactorsInsulin/metabolism/blood","PMC11367331",NA,"NOTNLM","Adipose TissueAgingType 2 Diabetes","Competing interests: None declared.","2024/08/31 09:45","2024/08/31 09:46","2024/08/29","2024/08/29 22:32","2024/03/08 00:00 [received]2024/07/08 00:00 [accepted]2024/08/31 09:46 [medline]2024/08/31 09:45 [pubmed]2024/08/29 22:32 [entrez]2024/08/29 00:00 [pmc-release]","12/4/e004179 [pii]bmjdrc-2024-004179 [pii]10.1136/bmjdrc-2024-004179 [doi]","epublish","BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care. 2024 Aug 29;12(4):e004179. doi: 10.1136/bmjdrc-2024-004179.","© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

Two proteomic multiplex platforms were employed for this purpose. METODS: An immunofluorescent multiplex platform and an aptamer-based method were used to evaluate 32 protein analytes from 153 individuals with moderate to severe major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HCs). The study focused on determining the level of agreement between the two platforms and evaluating the ability of individual analytes and principal components (PCs) to differentiate between the MDD and HC groups. Additionally, the study investigated the relationship between PCs consisting of chemokines and cytokines and comorbid inflammatory and cardiometabolic diseases. FINDINGS: Analysis revealed a small or moderate correlation between 47% of the analytes measured by the two platforms. Two proteomic profiles were identified that differentiated individuals with moderate to severe MDD from HCs. High eotaxin, age, BMI, IP-10, or IL-10 characterized profile 1. This profile was associated with several cardiometabolic risk factors, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Profile 2 is characterized by higher age, BMI, interleukins, and a strong negative loading for eotaxin. This profile was associated with inflammation but not cardiometabolic risk factors. CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence that proteomic profiles can be used to identify potential biomarkers and pathways associated with MDD and comorbidities. Our findings suggest that MDD is associated with distinct profiles of proteins that are also associated with cardiometabolic risk factors, inflammation, and obesity. In particular, the chemokines eotaxin and IP-10 appear to play a role in the relationship between MDD and cardiometabolic risk factors. These findings suggest that a focus on the interplay between MDD and comorbidities may be useful in identifying potential targets for intervention and improving overall health outcomes.","Watson, Kathleen TKeller, JenniferSpiro, Caleb MSatz, Isaac BGoncalves, Samantha VPankow, HeatherKosti, IditLehallier, BenoitSequeira, AdolfoBunney, William ERasgon, Natalie LSchatzberg, Alan F","Watson KTKeller JSpiro CMSatz IBGoncalves SVPankow HKosti ILehallier BSequeira ABunney WERasgon NLSchatzberg AF","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Alkahest Inc, San Carlos, CA, USA.Alkahest Inc, San Carlos, CA, USA.Department of Psychiatry & Human Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.School of Medicine, Irvine, CA, USA.Department of Psychiatry & Human Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA.School of Medicine, Irvine, CA, USA.Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240207","United States","Brain Behav Immun Health","Brain, behavior, & immunity  health","101759062",NA,NA,NA,"PMC10906146",NA,"NOTNLM","BiomarkersChemokinesCytokinesInflammationMajor depressive disorderProteomics","There is no conflict of interest among all the authors with either Luminex or Somalogic.BL and IK are a full-time employees of the biopharmaceutical company Alkahest, Inc.","2024/03/04 06:49","2024/03/04 06:50","2024/02/07","2024/03/04 05:05","2023/12/01 00:00 [received]2024/01/22 00:00 [revised]2024/01/25 00:00 [accepted]2024/03/04 06:50 [medline]2024/03/04 06:49 [pubmed]2024/03/04 05:05 [entrez]2024/02/07 00:00 [pmc-release]","S2666-3546(24)00009-7 [pii]100731 [pii]10.1016/j.bbih.2024.100731 [doi]","epublish","Brain Behav Immun Health. 2024 Feb 7;36:100731. doi: 10.1016/j.bbih.2024.100731. eCollection 2024 Mar.","© 2024 The Authors.",NA,NA,"10.1016/j.bbih.2024.100731",NA,2024

The mechanisms contributing to this metabolic heterogeneity are not fully understood. To address this question, plasma samples from 48 individuals with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2) were examined (27 with and 21 without metabolic syndrome). Fasting plasma samples were subjected to Olink proteomics analysis for 184 cardiometabolic and inflammation-enriched proteins. Data analysis showed a clear differentiation between the two groups with distinct plasma protein expression profiles. Twenty-four proteins were differentially expressed (DEPs) between the two groups. Pathways related to immune cell migration, leukocyte chemotaxis, chemokine signaling, mucosal inflammatory response, tissue repair and remodeling were enriched in the group with metabolic syndrome. Functional analysis of DEPs revealed upregulation of 15 immunological pathways. The study identifies some of the pathways that are altered and reflect metabolic health in individuals with obesity. This provides valuable insights into some of the underlying mechanisms and can lead to identification of therapeutic targets to improve metabolic health in individuals with obesity.","Mir, Fayaz AhmadAbdesselem, Houari BCyprian, FarhanIskandarani, AhmadDoudin, AsmmaSamra, Tareq AAlkasem, MeisAbdalhakam, IbrahemTaheri, ShahradAbou-Samra, Abdul-Badi","Mir FAAbdesselem HBCyprian FIskandarani ADoudin ASamra TAAlkasem MAbdalhakam ITaheri SAbou-Samra AB","Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, PO Box 3050, Doha, Qatar. fmir1@hamad.qa.Proteomics Core Facility, Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR), Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar.College of Health and Life Sciences (CHLS), Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar.College of Medicine, QU Health, Qatar University, PO Box 2713, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, PO Box 3050, Doha, Qatar.Laboratory of Immunoregulation, Research Department, Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, PO Box 3050, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, PO Box 3050, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, PO Box 3050, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, PO Box 3050, Doha, Qatar.National Obesity Treatment Center, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Weil Cornell Medicine -Qatar, Doha, Qatar.Qatar Metabolic Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, PO Box 3050, Doha, Qatar.National Obesity Treatment Center, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.Weil Cornell Medicine -Qatar, Doha, Qatar.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20231213","England","Sci Rep","Scientific reports","101563288",NA,"IM","Humans*Metabolic Syndrome/complications*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolismObesity/metabolism*Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology*Hypertension/complications*Insulin Resistance","PMC10719383",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare no competing interests.","2023/12/14 00:42","2023/12/17 09:42","2023/12/13","2023/12/13 23:39","2023/06/05 00:00 [received]2023/12/10 00:00 [accepted]2023/12/17 09:42 [medline]2023/12/14 00:42 [pubmed]2023/12/13 23:39 [entrez]2023/12/13 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1038/s41598-023-49643-8 [pii]49643 [pii]10.1038/s41598-023-49643-8 [doi]","epublish","Sci Rep. 2023 Dec 13;13(1):22185. doi: 10.1038/s41598-023-49643-8.","© 2023.

OBJECTIVE: To develop protein risk scores for ASCVD risk prediction and compare them to clinical risk factors and polygenic risk scores in primary and secondary event populations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The primary analysis was a retrospective study of primary events among 13 540 individuals in Iceland (aged 40-75 years) with proteomics data and no history of major ASCVD events at recruitment (study duration, August 23, 2000 until October 26, 2006; follow-up through 2018). We also analyzed a secondary event population from a randomized, double-blind lipid-lowering clinical trial (2013-2016), consisting of individuals with stable ASCVD receiving statin therapy and for whom proteomic data were available for 6791 individuals. EXPOSURES: Protein risk scores (based on 4963 plasma protein levels and developed in a training set in the primary event population); polygenic risk scores for coronary artery disease and stroke; and clinical risk factors that included age, sex, statin use, hypertension treatment, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and smoking status at the time of plasma sampling. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes were composites of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary heart disease death or cardiovascular death. Performance was evaluated using Cox survival models and measures of discrimination and reclassification that accounted for the competing risk of non-ASCVD death. RESULTS: In the primary event population test set (4018 individuals [59.0% women]; 465 events; median follow-up, 15.8 years), the protein risk score had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.93 per SD (95% CI, 1.75 to 2.13). Addition of protein risk score and polygenic risk scores significantly increased the C index when added to a clinical risk factor model (C index change, 0.022 [95% CI, 0.007 to 0.038]). Addition of the protein risk score alone to a clinical risk factor model also led to a significantly increased C index (difference, 0.014 [95% CI, 0.002 to 0.028]). Among White individuals in the secondary event population (6307 participants; 432 events; median follow-up, 2.2 years), the protein risk score had an HR of 1.62 per SD (95% CI, 1.48 to 1.79) and significantly increased C index when added to a clinical risk factor model (C index change, 0.026 [95% CI, 0.011 to 0.042]). The protein risk score was significantly associated with major adverse cardiovascular events among individuals of African and Asian ancestries in the secondary event population. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A protein risk score was significantly associated with ASCVD events in primary and secondary event populations. When added to clinical risk factors, the protein risk score and polygenic risk score both provided statistically significant but modest improvement in discrimination.","Helgason, HannesEiriksdottir, ThjodbjorgUlfarsson, Magnus OChoudhary, AbhishekLund, Sigrun HIvarsdottir, Erna VHjorleifsson Eldjarn, GrimurEinarsson, GudmundurFerkingstad, EgilMoore, Kristjan H SHonarpour, NarimonLiu, ThomasWang, HueiHucko, ThomasSabatine, Marc SMorrow, David AGiugliano, Robert POstrowski, Sisse RyePedersen, Ole BirgerBundgaard, HenningErikstrup, ChristianArnar, David OThorgeirsson, GudmundurMasson, GísliMagnusson, Olafur ThSaemundsdottir, JonaGretarsdottir, SolveigSteinthorsdottir, ValgerdurThorleifsson, GudmarHelgadottir, AnnaSulem, PatrickThorsteinsdottir, UnnurHolm, HilmaGudbjartsson, DanielStefansson, Kari","Helgason HEiriksdottir TUlfarsson MOChoudhary ALund SHIvarsdottir EVHjorleifsson Eldjarn GEinarsson GFerkingstad EMoore KHSHonarpour NLiu TWang HHucko TSabatine MSMorrow DAGiugliano RPOstrowski SRPedersen OBBundgaard HErikstrup CArnar DOThorgeirsson GMasson GMagnusson OTSaemundsdottir JGretarsdottir SSteinthorsdottir VThorleifsson GHelgadottir ASulem PThorsteinsdottir UHolm HGudbjartsson DStefansson K","deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.Amgen, Inc, Thousand Oaks, California.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.Amgen, Inc, Thousand Oaks, California.Amgen, Inc, Thousand Oaks, California.Amgen, Inc, Thousand Oaks, California.Amgen, Inc, Thousand Oaks, California.TIMI Study Group, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.TIMI Study Group, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.TIMI Study Group, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.Department of Clinical Immunology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Department of Clinical Immunology, Zealand University Hospital, Køge, Denmark.Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Department of Cardiology, The Heart Center, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Department of Clinical Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.Landspitali-The National University Hospital of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.Landspitali-The National University Hospital of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.deCODE genetics/Amgen, Inc, Reykjavik, Iceland.University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.","eng",NA,"Comparative StudyJournal Article",NA,"United States","JAMA","JAMA","7501160","0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)","IMCIN  doi: 10.1001/jama.2022.7448","FemaleHumansMale*Atherosclerosis/epidemiology/geneticsDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/epidemiologyHydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/therapeutic use*ProteomicsRetrospective StudiesStroke*Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/etiology/mortality/therapyRisk AssessmentAdultMiddle AgedAgedIceland/epidemiologyRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic","PMC10445198",NA,NA,NA,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Helgason reported other from deCODE genetics and Amgen (employee) outside the submitted work.

The identification of causal or protective biomarkers for COVID-19 severity may facilitate the development of novel therapies. OBJECTIVE: To identify protein biomarkers that promote or reduce COVID-19 severity and that mediate the association of cardiometabolic risk factors with COVID-19 severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This genetic association study using 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted in 2022 to investigate associations among cardiometabolic risk factors, circulating biomarkers, and COVID-19 hospitalization. Inputs for MR included genetic and proteomic data from 4147 participants with dysglycemia and cardiovascular risk factors collected through the Outcome Reduction With Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial. Genome-wide association study summary statistics were obtained from (1) 3 additional independent plasma proteome studies, (2) genetic consortia for selected cardiometabolic risk factors (including body mass index [BMI], type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes, and systolic blood pressure; all n >10 000), and (3) the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (n = 5773 hospitalized and 15 497 nonhospitalized case participants with COVID-19). Data analysis was performed in July 2022. EXPOSURES: Genetically determined concentrations of 235 circulating proteins assayed with a multiplex biomarker panel from the ORIGIN trial for the initial analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospitalization status of individuals from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative with a positive COVID-19 test result. RESULTS: Among 235 biomarkers tested in samples totaling 22 101 individuals, MR analysis showed that higher kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) levels reduced the likelihood of COVID-19 hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] per SD increase in KIM-1 levels, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.79-0.93]). A meta-analysis validated the protective association with no observed directional pleiotropy (OR per SD increase in KIM-1 levels, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.88-0.95]). Of the cardiometabolic risk factors studied, only BMI was associated with KIM-1 levels (0.17 SD increase in biomarker level per 1 kg/m2 [95% CI, 0.08-0.26]) and COVID-19 hospitalization (OR per 1-SD biomarker level, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.18-1.50]). Multivariable MR analysis also revealed that KIM-1 partially mitigated the association of BMI with COVID-19 hospitalization, reducing it by 10 percentage points (OR adjusted for KIM-1 level per 1 kg/m2, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.06-1.43]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this genetic association study, KIM-1 was identified as a potential mitigator of COVID-19 severity, possibly attenuating the increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization among individuals with high BMI. Further studies are required to better understand the underlying biological mechanisms.","Sood, TusharPerrot, NicolasChong, MichaelMohammadi-Shemirani, PedrumMushtaha, MahaLeong, DarrylRangarajan, SumathyHess, SibylleYusuf, SalimGerstein, Hertzel CParé, GuillaumePigeyre, Marie","Sood TPerrot NChong MMohammadi-Shemirani PMushtaha MLeong DRangarajan SHess SYusuf SGerstein HCParé GPigeyre M","Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Thrombosis and Atherosclerosis Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Thrombosis and Atherosclerosis Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Thrombosis and Atherosclerosis Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Deep Genomics Inc, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Global Medical Diabetes, Sanofi, Frankfurt, Germany.Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Thrombosis and Atherosclerosis Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.","eng","125794/CIHR/CanadaG-18-0022359/CIHR/Canada","Journal ArticleMeta-AnalysisResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20230703","United States","JAMA Netw Open","JAMA network open","101729235","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Humans*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/geneticsGenome-Wide Association StudyMendelian Randomization AnalysisProteomics*COVID-19/epidemiology/geneticsBiomarkers*Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/genetics","PMC10375306",NA,NA,NA,"Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Mohammadi-Shemirani reported being employed by Deep Genomics Inc during the conduct of the study.

In recent years, increasing evidence has emerged for the role of galectin-1 in obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Galectin-1 has been highly conserved through evolution and is involved in key cellular functions such as tissue maturation and homeostasis. It has been shown that galectin-1 increases in obesity, both in the circulation and in the adipose tissue of human and animal models. Several proteomic studies have independently identified an increased galectin-1 expression in the adipose tissue in obesity and in insulin resistance. Large population-based cohorts have demonstrated associations for circulating galectin-1 and markers of insulin resistance and incident type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, galectin-1 is associated with key metabolic pathways including glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as insulin signalling and inflammation. Intervention studies in animal models alter animal weight and metabolic profile. Several studies have also linked galectin-1 to the progression of complications in diabetes, including kidney disease and retinopathy. Here, we review the current knowledge on the clinical potential of galectin-1 in obesity and type 2 diabetes.","Fryk, EmanuelSilva, Vagner R RJansson, Per-Anders","Fryk ESilva VRRJansson PA","Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, 413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, 413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, 413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleReview","20220930","Switzerland","Metabolites","Metabolites","101578790",NA,NA,NA,"PMC9606923",NA,"NOTNLM","galectin-1insulin resistanceobesitytype 2 diabetes","The authors declare no conflict of interest.","2022/10/28 06:00","2022/10/28 06:01","2022/09/30","2022/10/27 01:39","2022/08/31 00:00 [received]2022/09/26 00:00 [revised]2022/09/26 00:00 [accepted]2022/10/27 01:39 [entrez]2022/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]2022/10/28 06:01 [medline]2022/09/30 00:00 [pmc-release]","metabo12100930 [pii]metabolites-12-00930 [pii]10.3390/metabo12100930 [doi]","epublish","Metabolites. 2022 Sep 30;12(10):930. doi: 10.3390/metabo12100930.",NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/metabo12100930",NA,2022

Furthermore, insulin has a significant influence on protein metabolism by affecting both the synthesis and degradation of proteins in various tissues. To understand the role of progressive hyperglycemia on plasma proteins, in this study, we measured the turnover rates of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated proteins in control (chow diet), prediabetic [a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk] or diabetic [HFD for 8 wk with low-dose streptozotocin (HFD + STZ) in weeks 5-8 of HFD] C57BL/6J mice using heavy water ((2)H(2)O)-based metabolic labeling approach. Compared with control mice, HFD and HFD + STZ mice showed elevations of fasting plasma glucose levels in the prediabetic and diabetic range, respectively. Furthermore, the HFD and HFD + STZ mice showed increased hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels, total plasma cholesterol, and plasma TGs. The kinetics of 40 proteins were quantified using the proteome dynamics method, which revealed an increase in the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of HDL-associated proteins in the prediabetic mice compared with control mice, and a decrease in FSR in the diabetic mice. The pathway analysis revealed that proteins with altered turnover rates were involved in acute-phase response, lipid metabolism, and coagulation. In conclusion, prediabetes and diabetes have distinct effects on the turnover rates of HDL proteins. These findings suggest that an early dysregulation of the HDL proteome dynamics can provide mechanistic insights into the changes in protein levels in these conditions.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study is the first to examine the role of gradual hyperglycemia during diabetes disease progression on HDL-associated protein dynamics in the prediabetes and diabetic mice. Our results show that the fractional synthesis rate of HDL-associated proteins increased in the prediabetic mice whereas it decreased in the diabetic mice compared with control mice. These kinetic changes can help to elucidate the mechanism of altered protein levels and HDL dysfunction during diabetes disease progression.","Sadana, PrabodhEdler, MelissaAghayev, MirjavidArias-Alvarado, AndreaCohn, EmilieIlchenko, SergueiPiontkivska, HelenPillai, Jagan AKashyap, SangeetaKasumov, Takhar","Sadana PEdler MAghayev MArias-Alvarado ACohn EIlchenko SPiontkivska HPillai JAKashyap SKasumov TAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2173-7231","Department of Pharmacy Practice, College of Pharmacy, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, Ohio.Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, Ohio.Department of Anthropology, Kent State University, Kent, Ohio.Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, Ohio.Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, Ohio.Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, Ohio.Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, Ohio.Department of Biological Sciences, and Brain Health Research Institute, Kent State University, Kent, Ohio.Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio.Department of Endocrinology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Northeast Ohio Medical University, Rootstown, Ohio.","eng","P50 AA024333/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United StatesR01 GM112044/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United StatesR01 HL129120/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesU24 DK097771/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20221012","United States","Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab","American journal of physiology.

Our objective in this discovery analysis was to identify genes and proteins regulated by DM to elucidate aberrant cellular metabolic and signaling mediators. We performed label-free proteomics and RNA-sequencing analysis of VAT from female bariatric surgery subjects with DM and without DM (NDM). We quantified 1965 protein groups, 23 proteins, and 372 genes that were differently abundant in DM vs. NDM VAT. Proteins downregulated in DM were related to fatty acid synthesis and mitochondrial function (fatty acid synthase, FASN; dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, mitochondrial, E3 component, DLD; succinate dehydrogenase-α, SDHA) while proteins upregulated in DM were associated with innate immunity and transcriptional regulation (vitronectin, VTN; endothelial protein C receptor, EPCR; signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B, STAT5B). Transcriptome indicated defects in innate inflammation, lipid metabolism, and extracellular matrix (ECM) function, and components of complement classical and alternative cascades. The VAT proteome and transcriptome shared 13 biological processes impacted by DM, related to complement activation, cell proliferation and migration, ECM organization, lipid metabolism, and gluconeogenesis. Our data revealed a marked effect of DM in downregulating FASN. We also demonstrate enrichment of complement factor B (CFB), coagulation factor XIII A chain (F13A1), thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), and integrins at mRNA and protein levels, albeit with lower q-values and lack of Western blot or PCR confirmation.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are common glucose-lowering drugs in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Among these, linagliptin has been suggested to exert kidney protective effects. It is investigated whether an effect of linagliptin on kidney function could be unmasked by characterizing the urinary proteome profile (UPP) in albuminuric T2D individuals. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Participants of the MARLINA-T2D trial (NCT01792518) are randomized 1:1 to receive either linagliptin 5 mg or placebo for 24 weeks. A previously developed proteome-based classifier, CKD273, is assessed. RESULTS: Results confirm a significant correlation between CKD273 and clinical kidney parameters as well as with eGFR decline. Patient stratification using CKD273 at baseline, show a trend toward attenuation of renal function loss in high CKD-risk patients treated with linagliptin. Moreover, characterized are linagliptin affected peptides of which the majority contained a DPP-4 target sequence. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: CKD273 is a promising tool for identifying patients at high risk for CKD progression and may unmask a potential of linagliptin to slow progressive kidney function loss in high CKD-risk patients. UPP characterization reveals a significant impact of linagliptin on urinary peptides.","Siwy, JustynaKlein, ThomasRosler, Marcelvon Eynatten, Maximilian","Siwy JAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-1407-2534Klein TRosler Mvon Eynatten M","mosaiques-diagnostics GmbH, Rotenburger Str. 20, 30659, Hannover, Germany.Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co.

The most routine method of assessing pancreatic beta-cell function is an oral glucose tolerance test, however this method is time consuming and carries a participant burden. The objectives of this research were to identify protein signatures and pathways related to pancreatic beta-cell function in fasting blood samples. METHODS: Beta-cell function measures were calculated for MECHE study participants who completed an oral glucose tolerance test and had proteomic data (n = 100). Information on 1,129 protein levels was obtained using the SOMAscan assay. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess discriminatory ability of proteins of interest. Subsequent in vitro experiments were performed using the BRIN-BD11 pancreatic beta-cell line. Replication of findings were achieved in a second human cohort where possible. RESULTS: Twenty-two proteins measured by aptamer technology were significantly associated with beta-cell function/HOMA-IR while 17 proteins were significantly associated with the disposition index (p ≤ 0.01). Receiver operator characteristic curves determined the protein panels to have excellent discrimination between low and high beta-cell function. Linear regression analysis determined that beta-endorphin and IL-17F have strong associations with beta-cell function/HOMA-IR, β = 0.039 (p = 0.005) and β = -0.027 (p = 0.013) respectively. Calcineurin and CRTAM were strongly associated with the disposition index (β = 0.005 and β = 0.005 respectively, p = 0.012). In vitro experiments confirmed that IL-17F modulated insulin secretion in the BRIN-BD11 cell line, with the lower concentration of 10 ng/mL significantly increasing glucose stimulated insulin secretion (p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of compromised beta-cell function could allow for implementation of nutritional and lifestyle interventions before progression to type 2 diabetes.","Curran, Aoife MScott-Boyer, Marie PierKaput, JimRyan, Miriam FDrummond, ElaineGibney, Eileen RGibney, Michael JRoche, Helen MBrennan, Lorraine","Curran AMScott-Boyer MPKaput JRyan MFDrummond EGibney ERGibney MJRoche HMBrennan LAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7711-7499","Institute of Food and Health, UCD School of Agriculture and Food Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland University College Dublin, Dublin, Republic of Ireland.Food for Health Ireland (FHI), University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland University College Dublin, Dublin, Republic of Ireland.The Microsoft Research  University of Trento Centre for Computational and Systems Biology (COSBI), Rovereto, Italy.Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences, Lausanne, Switzerland.Institute of Food and Health, UCD School of Agriculture and Food Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland University College Dublin, Dublin, Republic of Ireland.Institute of Food and Health, UCD School of Agriculture and Food Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland University College Dublin, Dublin, Republic of Ireland.Food for Health Ireland (FHI), University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland University College Dublin, Dublin, Republic of Ireland.Institute of Food and Health, UCD School of Agriculture and Food Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland University College Dublin, Dublin, Republic of Ireland.Food for Health Ireland (FHI), University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland University College Dublin, Dublin, Republic of Ireland.Institute of Food and Health, UCD School of Agriculture and Food Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland University College Dublin, Dublin, Republic of Ireland.Food for Health Ireland (FHI), University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland University College Dublin, Dublin, Republic of Ireland.Institute of Food and Health, UCD School of Agriculture and Food Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland University College Dublin, Dublin, Republic of Ireland.Food for Health Ireland (FHI), University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland University College Dublin, Dublin, Republic of Ireland.Nutrigenomics Research Group, UCD Conway Institute of Biomolecular and Biomedical Research and UCD Institute of Food and Health, School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Sports Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin, Republic of Ireland.Institute of Food and Health, UCD School of Agriculture and Food Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland University College Dublin, Dublin, Republic of Ireland.Food for Health Ireland (FHI), University College Dublin, Belfield, Ireland University College Dublin, Dublin, Republic of Ireland.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20180830","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Interleukin-17)0 (Proteome)60617-12-1 (beta-Endorphin)EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)","IM","AdultArea Under CurveBody Mass IndexCalcineurin/metabolismCell LineFemaleGlucose Tolerance TestHumansInsulin Secretion/drug effectsInsulin-Secreting Cells/cytology/*metabolismInterleukin-17/genetics/metabolism/pharmacologyLinear ModelsMaleMetabolic Networks and PathwaysProteome/*metabolism*ProteomicsROC CurveYoung Adultbeta-Endorphin/metabolism","PMC6117012",NA,NA,NA,"JK is currently employed by Vydiant Inc.

It increases with aging and obesity and is thought to play a role in the aetiology of insulin resistance and type II diabetes. The clinical significance of myosteatosis in cancer cachexia, however, remains to be determined. Along with demonstrable subcutaneous and visceral lipolysis, myosteatosis may also be a key component of the syndrome. We aimed to investigate the use of human urine as a non-invasive way to screen for molecular biomarkers of myosteatosis/reduced SMD using SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Pre-operative CT scans of patients undergoing surgery for upper gastrointestinal or hepatopancreaticobiliary cancer were analysed at the level of the third lumbar vertebrae. Myosteatosis was inferred as the presence of reduced SMD, which was defined as Hounsfield units for skeletal muscle <39.5 (two standard deviations below a normal healthy cohort). Urine was analysed by mass spectrometry using CM10 and IMAC30 SELDI-chips. Peaks observed in the CM10 and IMAC30 chip types, showed marked expressional differences between control and myosteatosis, were further investigated by mascot SELDI matrix matching. A total of 55 patients was recruited; 31 patients were found to be myosteatotic on CT scan. Application of the IMAC30-derived model to the entire cohort showed a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 71% and an overall correctness of 85%. Application of the CM10 chipset-based model to the entire cohort, showed a 77% sensitivity, 67% specificity and 73% overall correctness. Analysis of the peaks of interest resulted in the identification of significant fragments of cathepsin C, argin, arylsulfatase A and glial fibrillary acidic protein. We identified several potential urinary molecular biomarkers associated with reduced SMD in cancer. Such markers are potentially useful in deriving a clinical screening test for myosteatosis.","Husi, HolgerMacDonald, AlisdairSkipworth, Richard J EMiller, JaniceCronshaw, AndrewFearon, Kenneth C HRoss, James A","Husi HMacDonald ASkipworth RJEMiller JCronshaw AFearon KCHRoss JA","Department of Diabetes and Cardiovascular Science, University of the Highlands and Islands, Centre for Health Science, IV2 3JH Inverness, UK.Department of Clinical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, EH16 4SB Edinburgh, UK.Department of Clinical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, EH16 4SB Edinburgh, UK.Department of Clinical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, EH16 4SB Edinburgh, UK.School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.Department of Clinical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, EH16 4SB Edinburgh, UK.Department of Clinical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, EH16 4SB Edinburgh, UK.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20180425","England","Biomed Rep","Biomedical reports","101613227",NA,NA,NA,"PMC5996842",NA,"NOTNLM","SELDI-TOFmuscle wastingmyosteatosisurine biomarker",NA,"2018/06/16 06:00","2018/06/16 06:01","2018/04/25","2018/06/16 06:00","2018/03/07 00:00 [received]2018/04/19 00:00 [accepted]2018/06/16 06:00 [entrez]2018/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]2018/06/16 06:01 [medline]2018/04/25 00:00 [pmc-release]","BR-0-0-1091 [pii]10.3892/br.2018.1091 [doi]","ppublish","Biomed Rep. 2018 Jun;8(6):557-564. doi: 10.3892/br.2018.1091.

In the present study, we investigated the possible candidates for diabetes-related proteins in the hippocampus of ZDF rats and their control littermates (Zucker lean control, ZLC), by using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Approximately 2756 protein spots were detected by 2D-DIGE, and an increase or decrease of more than 1.4-fold was observed for 13 proteins in the hippocampal homogenates of ZDF rats relative to those of ZLC rats. Among these proteins, we found four proteins whose levels were significantly lower in the hippocampi of ZDF rats than in those of ZLC rats: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), apolipoprotein A-I preprotein (apoAI-P), myelin basic protein (MBP), and rCG39881, isoform CRA_a. Among these proteins, apoAI-P protein levels were decreased most prominently in ZDF rats than in ZLC rats, based on Western blot analysis. In addition, immunohistochemical and Western blot studies demonstrated that MBP, not GFAP, immunoreactivity and protein levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of ZDF rats compared to ZLC rats. In addition, ultrastructural analysis showed that ZDF rats showed myelin degeneration and disarrangement in the hippocampal tissue. These results suggest that chronic type 2 diabetes affects hippocampal function via reduction of MBP and apoAI-P levels as well as disarrangement of myelin.","Nam, Sung MinYoo, Dae YoungKwon, Hyun JungKim, Jong WhiJung, Hyo YoungKim, Dae WonHan, Ho JaeWon, Moo-HoSeong, Je KyungHwang, In KooYoon, Yeo Sung","Nam SMYoo DYKwon HJKim JWJung HYKim DWHan HJWon MHSeong JKHwang IKYoon YS","Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute for Veterinary Science, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea; Department of Anatomy, College of Veterinary Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul 05030, Republic of Korea.Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute for Veterinary Science, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea.Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Institute of Oral Sciences, College of Dentistry, Gangneung-Wonju National University, Gangneung 25457, South Korea.Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute for Veterinary Science, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea.Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute for Veterinary Science, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea.Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Institute of Oral Sciences, College of Dentistry, Gangneung-Wonju National University, Gangneung 25457, South Korea.Department of Veterinary Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute for Veterinary Science, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea.Department of Neurobiology, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, South Korea.Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute for Veterinary Science, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea; KMPC (Korea Mouse Phenotyping Center), Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea.Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute for Veterinary Science, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea; KMPC (Korea Mouse Phenotyping Center), Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, South Korea.

For diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy (DN), urinary proteome analysis was successfully applied in a pilot study. The validity of the previously established proteomic biomarkers with respect to the diagnostic and prognostic potential was assessed on a separate set of patients recruited at three different European centers. In this case-control study of 148 Caucasian patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and duration ≥5 years, cases of DN were defined as albuminuria >300 mg/d and diabetic retinopathy (n = 66). Controls were matched for gender and diabetes duration (n = 82). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Proteome analysis was performed blinded using high-resolution capillary electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry (CE-MS). Data were evaluated employing the previously developed model for DN. Upon unblinding, the model for DN showed 93.8% sensitivity and 91.4% specificity, with an AUC of 0.948 (95% CI 0.898-0.978). Of 65 previously identified peptides, 60 were significantly different between cases and controls of this study. In <10% of cases and controls classification by proteome analysis not entirely resulted in the expected clinical outcome. Analysis of patient's subsequent clinical course revealed later progression to DN in some of the false positive classified DN control patients. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the first independent confirmation that profiling of the urinary proteome by CE-MS can adequately identify subjects with DN, supporting the generalizability of this approach. The data further establish urinary collagen fragments as biomarkers for diabetes-induced renal damage that may serve as earlier and more specific biomarkers than the currently used urinary albumin.","Alkhalaf, AlaaZürbig, PetraBakker, Stephan J LBilo, Henk J GCerna, MarieFischer, ChristineFuchs, SebastianJanssen, BartMedek, KarelMischak, HaraldRoob, Johannes MRossing, KasperRossing, PeterRychlík, IvanSourij, HaraldTiran, BeateWinklhofer-Roob, Brigitte MNavis, Gerjan J","Alkhalaf AZürbig PBakker SJBilo HJCerna MFischer CFuchs SJanssen BMedek KMischak HRoob JMRossing KRossing PRychlík ISourij HTiran BWinklhofer-Roob BMNavis GJ","Department of Internal Medicine, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleMulticenter StudyResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tValidation Study","20101020","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Biomarkers/*urineCase-Control StudiesDiabetic Nephropathies/*urineElectrophoresis, CapillaryHumansLimit of DetectionMass Spectrometry*Proteomics","PMC2958112",NA,NA,NA,"Competing Interests: H.

Proteome analysis holds the promise of delivering insight into the pathophysiological changes associated with diabetes. Recently, we identified and validated urinary proteomics biomarkers for diabetes. Based on these initial findings, we aimed to further validate urinary proteomics biomarkers specific for diabetes in general, and particularity associated with either type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Therefore, the low-molecular-weight urinary proteome of 902 subjects from 10 different centers, 315 controls and 587 patients with T1D (n = 299) or T2D (n = 288), was analyzed using capillary-electrophoresis mass-spectrometry. The 261 urinary biomarkers (100 were sequenced) previously discovered in 205 subjects were validated in an additional 697 subjects to distinguish DM subjects (n = 382) from control subjects (n = 315) with 94% (95% CI: 92-95) accuracy in this study. To identify biomarkers that differentiate T1D from T2D, a subset of normoalbuminuric patients with T1D (n = 68) and T2D (n = 42) was employed, enabling identification of 131 biomarker candidates (40 were sequenced) differentially regulated between T1D and T2D. These biomarkers distinguished T1D from T2D in an independent validation set of normoalbuminuric patients (n = 108) with 88% (95% CI: 81-94%) accuracy, and in patients with impaired renal function (n = 369) with 85% (95% CI: 81-88%) accuracy. Specific collagen fragments were associated with diabetes and type of diabetes indicating changes in collagen turnover and extracellular matrix as one hallmark of the molecular pathophysiology of diabetes. Additional biomarkers including inflammatory processes and pro-thrombotic alterations were observed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings, based on the largest proteomic study performed to date on subjects with DM, validate the previously described biomarkers for DM, and pinpoint differences in the urinary proteome of T1D and T2D, indicating significant differences in extracellular matrix remodeling.","Maahs, David MSiwy, JustynaArgilés, AngelCerna, MarieDelles, ChristianDominiczak, Anna FGayrard, NathalieIphöfer, AlexanderJänsch, LotharJerums, GeorgeMedek, KarelMischak, HaraldNavis, Gerjan JRoob, Johannes MRossing, KasperRossing, PeterRychlík, IvanSchiffer, EricSchmieder, Roland EWascher, Thomas CWinklhofer-Roob, Brigitte MZimmerli, Lukas UZürbig, PetraSnell-Bergeon, Janet K","Maahs DMSiwy JArgilés ACerna MDelles CDominiczak AFGayrard NIphöfer AJänsch LJerums GMedek KMischak HNavis GJRoob JMRossing KRossing PRychlík ISchiffer ESchmieder REWascher TCWinklhofer-Roob BMZimmerli LUZürbig PSnell-Bergeon JK","Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.

To dissect the underlying mechanisms, we performed a multiplexed proteomics study on liver mitochondria isolated from a spontaneous diabetic rat model before/after they were rendered diabetic. Altogether, we identified 1091 mitochondrial proteins, 228 phosphoproteins, and 355 hydroxyproteins. Mitochondrial proteins were found to undergo expression changes in a highly correlated fashion during T2D development. For example, proteins involved in beta-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and other bioenergetic processes were coordinately up-regulated, indicating that liver cells confronted T2D by increasing energy expenditure and activating pathways that rid themselves of the constitutively increased flux of glucose and lipid. Notably, activation of oxidative phosphorylation was immediately related to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which caused oxidative stress within the cells. Increased oxidative stress was also evidenced by our post-translational modification profiles such that mitochondrial proteins were more heavily hydroxylated during T2D development. Moreover, we observed a distinct depression of antiapoptosis and antioxidative stress proteins that might reflect a higher apoptotic index under the diabetic stage. We suggest that such changes in systematic metabolism were causally linked to the development of T2D. Comparing proteomics data against microarray data, we demonstrated that many T2D-related alterations were unidentifiable by either proteomics or genomics approaches alone, underscoring the importance of integrating different approaches. Our compendium could help to unveil pathogenic events in mitochondria leading to T2D and be useful for the discovery of diagnosis biomarker and therapeutic targets of T2D.","Deng, Wen-JunNie, SongDai, JieWu, Jia-RuiZeng, Rong","Deng WJNie SDai JWu JRZeng R","Key Laboratory of Systems Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20090823","United States","Mol Cell Proteomics","Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP","101125647","0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)0 (Phosphoproteins)0 (Proteins)0 (Proteome)0 (RNA, Messenger)","IM","AnimalsBlotting, WesternDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/genetics/*metabolism/pathologyGene Expression ProfilingHydroxylationMass SpectrometryMetabolomics/methodsMitochondria, Liver/*metabolismMitochondrial Proteins/genetics/metabolismModels, BiologicalPhosphoproteins/*analysis/geneticsProtein Processing, Post-TranslationalProteins/*analysis/genetics/metabolismProteome/*analysis/geneticsProteomics/methodsRNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolismRatsTime Factors","PMC2808256",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2009/08/25 09:00","2010/05/04 06:00","2011/01/01","2009/08/25 09:00","2009/08/25 09:00 [entrez]2009/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]2010/05/04 06:00 [medline]2011/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","S1535-9476(20)33899-8 [pii]M900020-MCP200 [pii]10.1074/mcp.M900020-MCP200 [doi]","ppublish","Mol Cell Proteomics. 2010 Jan;9(1):100-16. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M900020-MCP200.

METHODS: Using a combination of online capillary electrophoresis (CE) and MS we evaluated urinary polypeptide patterns in four groups of type 2 diabetic patients matched for age, gender, and diabetes duration, including 20 normoalbuminuric patients with and 20 without diabetic retinopathy, 20 microalbuminuric patients with diabetic retinopathy, and 18 macroalbuminuric patients with diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, changes in urinary polypeptide patterns during treatment with the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) candesartan were evaluated in the macroalbuminuric patients in a randomized double-blinded, cross-over trial where each patient received treatment with placebo, candesartan 8, 16, and 32 mg daily each for 2 months. RESULTS: Overall, 4551 different polypeptides were found in the samples. Urinary polypeptide patterns were comparable in normo (with and without diabetic retinopathy) and microalbuminuric patients, whereas distinct differences were found in macroalbuminuric patients. Differences in urinary polypeptide patterns between normo and macroalbuminuric patients permitted the establishment of a ""diabetic renal damage"" pattern consisting of 113 polypeptides. Eleven of these polypeptides had been sequenced and identified. Candesartan treatment in macroalbuminuric patients significantly changed 15 of the 113 polypeptides in the diabetic renal damage pattern toward levels in normoalbuminuric patients. Change in the diabetic renal damage pattern was not candesartan dose-dependent but individual changes correlated with changes in urinary albumin excretion at each dose level. CONCLUSION: CE-MS serves as a fast and sensitive tool for identification of biomarkers and urinary polypeptide patterns specific for macroalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients and may be used to explore and monitor renoprotective effects of ARB.","Rossing, KasperMischak, HaraldParving, Hans-HenrikChristensen, Per KWalden, MichaelHillmann, MeikeKaiser, Thorsten","Rossing KMischak HParving HHChristensen PKWalden MHillmann MKaiser T","Steno Diabetes Center, Gentofte, Denmark. krossing@dadlnet.dk","eng",NA,"Clinical TrialJournal ArticleRandomized Controlled Trial",NA,"United States","Kidney Int","Kidney international","0323470","0 (Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers)0 (Benzimidazoles)0 (Biomarkers)0 (Biphenyl Compounds)0 (Peptides)0 (Tetrazoles)S8Q36MD2XX (candesartan)","IM","Albuminuria/drug therapy/urineAmino Acid SequenceAngiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/*administration & dosageBenzimidazoles/*administration & dosageBiomarkers/urineBiphenyl CompoundsCross-Over StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complicationsDiabetic Nephropathies/*drug therapy/*urineElectrophoresis, CapillaryFemaleHumansMaleMass SpectrometryMiddle AgedMolecular Sequence DataPeptides/analysis/chemistry/*urineTetrazoles/*administration & dosage",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2005/06/16 09:00","2005/09/24 09:00",NA,"2005/06/16 09:00","2005/06/16 09:00 [pubmed]2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]2005/06/16 09:00 [entrez]","S0085-2538(15)50827-2 [pii]10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.00394.x [doi]","ppublish","Kidney Int. 2005 Jul;68(1):193-205. doi: 10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.00394.x.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2005

METHODS: We measured 233 proteins at baseline in 1653 participants from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) S4 cohort study (median follow-up time: 13.5 years). We used logistic regression in the cross-sectional analysis (n=1300), and Cox regression accounting for interval-censored data in the longitudinal analysis (n=1143). We further applied two-level growth models to investigate associations with repeatedly measured traits (fasting glucose, 2 h glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-B, HOMA-IR, HbA(1c)), and two-sample Mendelian randomisation analysis to investigate causal associations. Moreover, we built prediction models using priority-Lasso on top of Framingham-Offspring Risk Score components and evaluated the prediction accuracy through AUC. RESULTS: We identified 14, 24 and four proteins associated with prevalent prediabetes (i.e. impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired fasting glucose), prevalent newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and incident type 2 diabetes, respectively (28 overlapping proteins). Of these, IL-17D, IL-18 receptor 1, carbonic anhydrase-5A, IL-1 receptor type 2 (IL-1RT2) and matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein were novel candidates. IGF binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and paraoxonase 3 (PON3) were inversely associated while fibroblast growth factor 21 was positively associated with incident type 2 diabetes. LPL was longitudinally linked with change in glucose-related traits, while IGFBP2 and PON3 were linked with changes in both insulin and glucose-related traits. Mendelian randomisation analysis suggested causal effects of LPL on type 2 diabetes and fasting insulin. The simultaneous addition of 12 priority-Lasso-selected biomarkers (IGFBP2, IL-18, IL-17D, complement component C1q receptor, V-set and immunoglobulin domain-containing protein 2, IL-1RT2, LPL, CUB domain-containing protein 1, vascular endothelial growth factor D, PON3, C-C motif chemokine 4 and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5) significantly improved the predictive performance (ΔAUC 0.0219; 95% CI 0.0052, 0.0624). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We identified new candidates involved in the development of derangements in glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes and confirmed previously reported proteins. Our findings underscore the importance of proteins in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and the identified putative proteins can function as potential pharmacological targets for diabetes treatment and prevention.","Luo, HongBauer, AlinaNano, JanaPetrera, AgneseRathmann, WolfgangHerder, ChristianHauck, Stefanie MSun, Benjamin BHoyer, AnnikaPeters, AnnetteThorand, Barbara","Luo HAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3538-3147Bauer ANano JPetrera AAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-0583-6195Rathmann WAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-7804-1740Herder CAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2050-093XHauck SMAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-1630-6827Sun BBAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6347-2281Hoyer AAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-0241-9951Peters AAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6645-0985Thorand BAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8416-6440","Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology (IBE), Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Pettenkofer School of Public Health, Munich, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology (IBE), Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Pettenkofer School of Public Health, Munich, Germany.Metabolomics and Proteomics Core, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Biometrics and Epidemiology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner Düsseldorf, Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner Düsseldorf, Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Clinical Diabetology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.Department of Endocrinology and Diabetology, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Düsseldorf, Heinrich Heine Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany.Metabolomics and Proteomics Core, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner München-Neuherberg, Neuherberg, Germany.Translation Sciences, Research & Development, Biogen Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.Biostatistics and Medical Biometry, Medical School OWL, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology (IBE), Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Pettenkofer School of Public Health, Munich, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner München-Neuherberg, Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany. barbara.thorand@helmholtz-munich.de.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner München-Neuherberg, Neuherberg, Germany. barbara.thorand@helmholtz-munich.de.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20230613","Germany","Diabetologia","Diabetologia","0006777","0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor D)0 (Interleukin-27)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)0 (Insulin)","IM","Humans*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolismVascular Endothelial Growth Factor DCohort StudiesProteomicsCross-Sectional Studies*Interleukin-27*Prediabetic StateGlucoseInsulin",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","Cohort studyMendelian randomisationProteomicsTraits of glucose and insulinType 2 diabetes",NA,"2023/06/13 01:13","2023/08/01 06:44",NA,"2023/06/12 23:28","2022/10/19 00:00 [received]2023/04/12 00:00 [accepted]2023/08/01 06:44 [medline]2023/06/13 01:13 [pubmed]2023/06/12 23:28 [entrez]","10.1007/s00125-023-05943-2 [pii]10.1007/s00125-023-05943-2 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetologia. 2023 Sep;66(9):1655-1668. doi: 10.1007/s00125-023-05943-2.

This study aims to determine the effects of FGR and early catch-up growth after birth on the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, with particular attention to glucose tolerance, pancreatic islet morphology, and fibrosis, and to elucidate its mechanism using proteomics analysis. The FGR rat model was made by inducing mild intrauterine hypoperfusion using ameroid constrictors (ACs). On day 17 of pregnancy, ACs were affixed to the uterine and ovarian arteries bilaterally, causing a 20.9% reduction in birth weight compared to sham pups. On postnatal day 4 (P4), the pups were assigned to either the good nutrition (GN) groups with 5 pups per dam to ensure postnatal catch-up growth or poor nutrition groups with 15 pups per dam to maintain lower body weight. After weaning, all pups were fed regular chow food ad libitum (P21). Rats in both FGR groups developed glucose intolerance; however, male rats in the FGR good nutrition (FGR-GN) group also developed hypertriglyceridemia and dysmorphic pancreatic islets with fibrosis. A comprehensive and functional analysis of proteins expressed in the pancreas showed that FGR, followed by early catch-up growth, severely aggravated cell adhesion-related protein expression in male offspring. Thus, FGR and early catch-up growth caused pancreatic islet morphological abnormalities and fibrosis associated with the disturbance of cell adhesion-related protein expressions. These changes likely induce glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia in male rats.","Jabary, MahbobaOnoda, AtsutoKitase, YumaUeda, KazutoMimatsu, HarukaGo, ShojiMiura, RyosukeTsuji, MasahiroTakahashi, YoshiyukiHayakawa, MasahiroSato, Yoshiaki","Jabary MOnoda AKitase YUeda KMimatsu HGo SMiura RTsuji MTakahashi YHayakawa MSato Y","Division of Neonatology, Center for Maternal-Neonatal Care, Nagoya University Hospital, 65 Tsurumai-Cho Showa-Ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.Division of Neonatology, Center for Maternal-Neonatal Care, Nagoya University Hospital, 65 Tsurumai-Cho Showa-Ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.Department of Toxicology and Health Science, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sanyo-Onoda City University, Sanyoonoda, Japan.Division of Neonatology, Center for Maternal-Neonatal Care, Nagoya University Hospital, 65 Tsurumai-Cho Showa-Ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.Division of Neonatology, Center for Maternal-Neonatal Care, Nagoya University Hospital, 65 Tsurumai-Cho Showa-Ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.Division of Neonatology, Center for Maternal-Neonatal Care, Nagoya University Hospital, 65 Tsurumai-Cho Showa-Ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.Division of Neonatology, Center for Maternal-Neonatal Care, Nagoya University Hospital, 65 Tsurumai-Cho Showa-Ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.Division of Neonatology, Center for Maternal-Neonatal Care, Nagoya University Hospital, 65 Tsurumai-Cho Showa-Ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.Department of Food and Nutrition, Kyoto Women's University, Kyoto, Japan.Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.Division of Neonatology, Center for Maternal-Neonatal Care, Nagoya University Hospital, 65 Tsurumai-Cho Showa-Ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.Division of Neonatology, Center for Maternal-Neonatal Care, Nagoya University Hospital, 65 Tsurumai-Cho Showa-Ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan. yoshiaki@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20230215","England","Sci Rep","Scientific reports","101563288",NA,"IM","PregnancyHumansFemaleAnimalsRatsMaleFetal Growth Retardation/metabolismAnimals, Newborn*Glucose Intolerance/pathology*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications*Islets of Langerhans/metabolismFibrosis","PMC9932152",NA,NA,NA,"The authors declare no competing interests.","2023/02/16 06:00","2023/02/18 06:00","2023/02/15","2023/02/15 23:19","2022/04/17 00:00 [received]2023/01/20 00:00 [accepted]2023/02/15 23:19 [entrez]2023/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]2023/02/18 06:00 [medline]2023/02/15 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1038/s41598-023-28584-2 [pii]28584 [pii]10.1038/s41598-023-28584-2 [doi]","epublish","Sci Rep. 2023 Feb 15;13(1):2732. doi: 10.1038/s41598-023-28584-2.","© 2023.

It is therefore important to deeply characterize the human nutritional responses. OBJECTIVE: Endocrine parameters and the metabolome of human plasma are rapidly responding to acute nutritional interventions such as caloric restriction or a glucose challenge. It is less well understood whether the plasma proteome would be equally dynamic, and whether it could be a source of corresponding biomarkers. METHODS: We used high-throughput mass spectrometry to determine changes in the plasma proteome of i) 10 healthy, young, male individuals in response to 2 days of acute caloric restriction followed by refeeding; ii) 200 individuals of the Ely epidemiological study before and after a glucose tolerance test at 4 time points (0, 30, 60, 120 minutes); and iii) 200 random individuals from the Generation Scotland study. We compared the proteomic changes detected with metabolome data and endocrine parameters. RESULTS: Both caloric restriction and the glucose challenge substantially impacted the plasma proteome. Proteins responded across individuals or in an individual-specific manner. We identified nutrient-responsive plasma proteins that correlate with changes in the metabolome, as well as with endocrine parameters. In particular, our study highlights the role of apolipoprotein C1 (APOC1), a small, understudied apolipoprotein that was affected by caloric restriction and dominated the response to glucose consumption and differed in abundance between individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies APOC1 as a dominant nutritional responder in humans and highlights the interdependency of acute nutritional response proteins and the endocrine system.","Vernardis,

Here, the clustering approach was applied to individuals with T2D from the Qatar Biobank and validated in an independent set. Cluster-specific signatures of circulating metabolites and proteins were established, revealing subtype-specific molecular mechanisms, including activation of the complement system with features of autoimmune diabetes and reduced 1,5-anhydroglucitol in SIDD, impaired insulin signaling in SIRD, and elevated leptin and fatty acid binding protein levels in MOD. The MARD cluster was the healthiest with metabolomic and proteomic profiles most similar to the controls.

In addition, we assessed sex-specific associations between the validated proteins and pathophysiological pathways of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included Black South African men (n=380) and women (n=375) who were part of the Middle-Aged Soweto Cohort (MASC). Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to determine fat mass and visceral adipose tissue, and fasting venous blood samples were collected for analysis of glucose, insulin and C-peptide and for targeted proteomics, measuring a total of 184 pre-selected protein biomarkers. An OGTT was performed on participants without diabetes, and peripheral insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), HOMA-IR, basal insulin clearance, insulin secretion (C-peptide index) and beta cell function (disposition index) were estimated. Participants were classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n=546), IGM (n=116) or type 2 diabetes (n=93). Proteins associated with dysglycaemia (IGM or type 2 diabetes) in the MASC were validated in the Swedish EpiHealth cohort (NGT, n=1706; impaired fasting glucose, n=550; type 2 diabetes, n=210). RESULTS: We identified 73 proteins associated with dysglycaemia in the MASC, of which 34 were validated in the EpiHealth cohort. Among these validated proteins, 11 were associated with various measures of insulin dynamics, with the largest number of proteins being associated with HOMA-IR. In sex-specific analyses, IGF-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) was associated with lower HOMA-IR in women (coefficient -0.35; 95% CI -0.44, -0.25) and men (coefficient -0.09; 95% CI -0.15, -0.03). Metalloproteinase inhibitor 4 (TIMP4) was associated with higher insulin secretion (coefficient 0.05; 95% CI 0.001, 0.11; p for interaction=0.025) and beta cell function (coefficient 0.06; 95% CI 0.02, 0.09; p for interaction=0.013) in women only. In contrast, a stronger positive association between IGFBP2 and insulin sensitivity determined using an OGTT (coefficient 0.38; 95% CI 0.27, 0.49) was observed in men (p for interaction=0.004). A posteriori analysis showed that the associations between TIMP4 and insulin dynamics were not mediated by adiposity. In contrast, most of the associations between IGFBP2 and insulin dynamics, except for insulin secretion, were mediated by either fat mass index or visceral adipose tissue in men and women. Fat mass index was the strongest mediator between IGFBP2 and insulin sensitivity (total effect mediated 40.7%; 95% CI 37.0, 43.6) and IGFBP2 and HOMA-IR (total effect mediated 39.1%; 95% CI 31.1, 43.5) in men. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We validated 34 proteins that were associated with type 2 diabetes, of which 11 were associated with measures of type 2 diabetes pathophysiology such as peripheral insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. This study highlights biomarkers that are similar between cohorts of different ancestry, with different lifestyles and sociodemographic profiles. The African-specific biomarkers identified require validation in African cohorts to identify risk markers and increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes in African populations.","Mendham, Amy EMicklesfield, Lisa KKarpe, FredrikKengne, Andre PascalChikowore, TinasheKufe, Clement NMasemola, MaphokoCrowther, Nigel JNorris, Shane AOlsson, TommyElmståhl, SölveFall,

The close relationship between obesity and T2D in children is mainly sustained by insulin resistance (IR). In addition, the cardiometabolic burden of T2D including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome is also strictly related to IR. Although T2D pathophysiology has been largely studied in an attempt to improve therapeutic options, molecular mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. In this perspective, omics approaches (including lipidomics, metabolomics, proteomics and metagenomics) are providing the most attractive therapeutic options for T2D. In particular, distinct both lipids and metabolites are emerging as potential therapeutic tools. Of note, among lipid classes, the pathogenic role of ceramides in T2D context has been supported by several data. Thus, selective changes of ceramides expression might represent innovative therapeutic strategies for T2D treatment. More, distinct metabolomics pathways have been also found to be associated with higher T2D risk, by providing novel potential T2D biomarkers. Taken together, omics data are responsible for the expanding knowledge of T2D pathophysiology, by providing novel insights to improve therapeutic strategies for this tangled disease. We aimed to summarize the most recent evidence in the intriguing field of the omics approaches in T2D both in adults and children.","Passaro, Antonio ParideMarzuillo, PierluigiGuarino, StefanoScaglione, FedericaMiraglia Del Giudice, EmanueleDi Sessa, Anna","Passaro APMarzuillo PGuarino SScaglione FMiraglia Del Giudice EDi Sessa A","Department of Woman, Child and of General and Specialized Surgery, Università degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Napoli 80138, Italy.Department of Woman, Child and of General and Specialized Surgery, Università degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Napoli 80138, Italy.Department of Woman, Child and of General and Specialized Surgery, Università degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Napoli 80138, Italy.Department of Woman, Child and of General and Specialized Surgery, Università degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Napoli 80138, Italy.Department of Woman, Child and of General and Specialized Surgery, Università degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Napoli 80138, Italy.Department of Woman, Child and of General and Specialized Surgery, Università degli Studi della Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Napoli 80138, Italy. anna.disessa@libero.it.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleReview",NA,"United States","World J Diabetes","World journal of diabetes","101547524",NA,NA,NA,"PMC8696648",NA,"NOTNLM","AdultsChildrenDiabetesOmicsType 2 diabetes","Conflict-of-interest statement: No conflict of interest to declare.","2022/01/21 06:00","2022/01/21 06:01","2021/12/15","2022/01/20 06:03","2021/02/28 00:00 [received]2021/04/01 00:00 [revised]2021/11/02 00:00 [accepted]2022/01/20 06:03 [entrez]2022/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]2022/01/21 06:01 [medline]2021/12/15 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.4239/wjd.v12.i12.2027 [doi]","ppublish","World J Diabetes. 2021 Dec 15;12(12):2027-2035. doi: 10.4239/wjd.v12.i12.2027.","©The Author(s) 2021.

We aimed to evaluate the plasma protein profiles associated with the T2D remission after obesity surgery. We recruited seventeen women with severe obesity submitted to bariatric procedures, including six non-diabetic patients and eleven patients with T2D. After surgery, diabetes remitted in 7 of the 11 patients with T2D. Plasma protein profiles at baseline and 6 months after bariatric surgery were analyzed by two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight/time-of-flight coupled to mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS). Remission of T2D following bariatric procedures was associated with changes in alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (SERPINA 3, p < 0.05), alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M, p < 0.005), ceruloplasmin (CP, p < 0.05), fibrinogen beta chain (FBG, p < 0.05), fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG, p < 0.05), gelsolin (GSN, p < 0.05), prothrombin (F2, p < 0.05), and serum amyloid p-component (APCS, p < 0.05). The resolution of diabetes after bariatric surgery is associated with specific changes in the plasma proteomic profiles of proteins involved in acute-phase response, fibrinolysis, platelet degranulation, and blood coagulation, providing a pathophysiological basis for the study of their potential use as biomarkers of the surgical remission of T2D in a larger series of severely obese patients.","Insenser, MaríaVilarrasa, NuriaVendrell, JoanEscobar-Morreale, Héctor F","Insenser MAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3168-7856Vilarrasa NAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3188-1990Vendrell JEscobar-Morreale HFAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6890-1644","Diabetes, Obesity and Human Reproduction Research Group, Instituto Ramón y Cajal de Investigación Sanitaria (IRYCIS), Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal, Universidad de Alcalá, E-28034 Madrid, Spain.Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red Diabetes y Enfermedades Metabólicas Asociadas (CIBERDEM), E-28029 Madrid, Spain.Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red Diabetes y Enfermedades Metabólicas Asociadas (CIBERDEM), E-28029 Madrid, Spain.Department of Endocrinology & Nutrition, Hospital Universitari Bellvitge, Hospitalet de Llobregat, E-08907 Barcelona, Spain.Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red Diabetes y Enfermedades Metabólicas Asociadas (CIBERDEM), E-28029 Madrid, Spain.Department of Endocrinology & Nutrition, Institut d'Investigació Sanitaria Pere Virgili, Hospital Universitari de Tarragona Joan XXIII, E-43005 Tarragona, Spain.Diabetes, Obesity and Human Reproduction Research Group, Instituto Ramón y Cajal de Investigación Sanitaria (IRYCIS), Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal, Universidad de Alcalá, E-28034 Madrid, Spain.Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red Diabetes y Enfermedades Metabólicas Asociadas (CIBERDEM), E-28029 Madrid, Spain.","eng","PI1501686 and PIE1600050/Instituto de Salud Carlos III/DIASOBS/Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red Diabetes y Enfermedades Metabólicas Asociadas/","Journal Article","20210828","Switzerland","J Clin Med","Journal of clinical medicine","101606588",NA,NA,NA,"PMC8432028",NA,"NOTNLM","2D-DIGEbariatric surgerydiabetes remissionobesityproteomicstype 2 diabetes","The authors declare no conflict of interest.

The diagnosis of T2D is commonly based on plasma glucose levels, and there are no reliable clinical biomarkers available for early detection. Recent advances in proteome technologies offer new opportunity for the understanding of T2D; however, the underlying proteomic characteristics of T2D have not been thoroughly investigated yet. Here, using proteomic and glycoproteomic profiling, we provided a comprehensive landscape of molecular alterations in the fasting plasma of the 24 Chinese participants, including eight T2D patients, eight prediabetic (PDB) subjects, and eight healthy control (HC) individuals. Our analyses identified a diverse set of potential biomarkers that might enhance the efficiency and accuracy based on current existing biological indicators of (pre)diabetes. Through integrative omics analysis, we showed the capability of glycoproteomics as a complement to proteomics or metabolomics, to provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of (pre)diabetes. We have newly identified systemic site-specific N-glycosylation alterations underlying T2D patients in the complement activation pathways, including decreased levels of N-glycopeptides from C1s, MASP1, and CFP proteins, and increased levels of N-glycopeptides from C2, C4, C4BPA, C4BPB, and CFH. These alterations were not observed at proteomic levels, suggesting new opportunities for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Our results demonstrate a great potential role of glycoproteomics in understanding (pre)diabetes and present a new direction for diabetes research which deserves more attention.","Zhao, YangWang, ManMeng, BoGao, YingXue, ZhichaoHe, MinjunJiang, YouDai, XinhuaYan, DanFang, Xiang","Zhao YWang MMeng BGao YXue ZHe MJiang YDai XYan DFang X","Center for Advanced Measurement Science, National Institute of Metrology, Beijing, China.Center for Advanced Measurement Science, National Institute of Metrology, Beijing, China.College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China.Center for Advanced Measurement Science, National Institute of Metrology, Beijing, China.Center for Advanced Measurement Science, National Institute of Metrology, Beijing, China.Center for Advanced Measurement Science, National Institute of Metrology, Beijing, China.Center for Advanced Measurement Science, National Institute of Metrology, Beijing, China.Center for Advanced Measurement Science, National Institute of Metrology, Beijing, China.Center for Advanced Measurement Science, National Institute of Metrology, Beijing, China.College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, China.Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Beijing Key Laboratory of Bio-characteristic Profiling for Evaluation of Rational Drug Use, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Center for Advanced Measurement Science, National Institute of Metrology, Beijing, China.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20210611","Switzerland","Front Chem","Frontiers in chemistry","101627988",NA,NA,NA,"PMC8226093",NA,"NOTNLM","N-glycopeptidescomplementdiabetesglycoproteomicsproteomics","The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.","2021/06/29 06:00","2021/06/29 06:01","2021/01/01","2021/06/28 06:05","2021/03/08 00:00 [received]2021/05/14 00:00 [accepted]2021/06/28 06:05 [entrez]2021/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]2021/06/29 06:01 [medline]2021/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","677621 [pii]10.3389/fchem.2021.677621 [doi]","epublish","Front Chem. 2021 Jun 11;9:677621. doi: 10.3389/fchem.2021.677621. eCollection 2021.","Copyright © 2021 Zhao, Wang, Meng, Gao, Xue, He, Jiang, Dai, Yan and Fang.",NA,NA,"10.3389/fchem.2021.677621",NA,2021

We previously uncovered a role for the serine hydrolase carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) in mediating intratumoral activation of the prodrug irinotecan, a constituent of FOLFIRINOX. We aimed to further test the predictive value of CES2 for response to irinotecan using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and to elucidate the determinants of CES2 expression and response to FOLFIRINOX treatment among patients with PDAC. METHODS: PDXs were engrafted subcutaneously into nude mice and treated for 4 weeks with either saline control or irinotecan. CES2 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) expression in PDAC tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied to assess the association between overall survival and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels in patients who underwent neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX treatment. RESULTS: High CES2 activity in PDAC PDXs was associated with increased sensitivity to irinotecan. Integrated gene expression, proteomic analyses, and in vitro genetic experiments revealed that nuclear receptor HNF4A, which is upregulated in diabetes, is the upstream transcriptional regulator of CES2 expression. Elevated CES2 protein expression in PDAC tissues was positively associated with a history of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, 4.84; P = .02). High HbA1C levels were associated with longer overall survival in patients who received neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX treatment (P = .04). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, we provide, for the first time, evidence that CES2 expression is associated with a history of type 2 diabetes in PDAC and that elevated HbA1C, by predicting tumor CES2 expression, may represent a novel marker for stratifying patients most likely to respond to FOLFIRINOX therapy.","Capello, MichelaFahrmann, Johannes FRios Perez, Mayrim VVykoukal, Jody VIrajizad, EhsanTripathi, Satyendra CRoife, DavidBantis, Leonidas EKang, Ya'anKundnani, Deepali LXu, HanwenPrakash, Laura RLong, James PKatayama, HiroyukiFleury, AliaFerri-Borgogno, SammyBaluya, Dodge LDennison, Jennifer BAguilar-Bonavides, ClementeCasabar, Julian PCeliktas, MugeDo, Kim-AnhFiehn, OliverMaitra, AnirbanWang, HuaminFeng, ZidingChiao, Paul JKatz, Matthew HFleming, Jason BHanash, Samir M","Capello MFahrmann JFRios Perez MVVykoukal JVIrajizad ETripathi SCRoife DBantis LEKang YKundnani DLXu HPrakash LRLong JPKatayama HFleury AFerri-Borgogno SBaluya DLDennison JBAguilar-Bonavides CCasabar JPCeliktas MDo KAFiehn OMaitra AWang HFeng ZChiao PJKatz MHFleming JBHanash SM","Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS.Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Center for Radiation Oncology Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Clinical Cancer Prevention, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.University of California Davis Genome Center-Metabolomics, University of California, Davis, CA.Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS.Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Surgical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, H.

This is mainly due to an unhealthy nutrition, implying that variation in CVD risk may be due to variation in the capacity to manage a nutritional load. We examined the genomic basis of postprandial metabolism. Our main purpose was to introduce the GEMM Family Study (Genetics of Metabolic Diseases in Mexico) as a multi-center study carrying out an ongoing recruitment of healthy urban adults. Each participant received a mixed meal challenge and provided a 5-hours' time course series of blood, buffy coat specimens for DNA isolation, and adipose tissue (ADT)/skeletal muscle (SKM) biopsies at fasting and 3 h after the meal. A comprehensive profiling, including metabolomic signatures in blood and transcriptomic and proteomic profiling in SKM and ADT, was performed to describe tendencies for variation in postprandial response. Our data generation methods showed preliminary trends indicating that by characterizing the dynamic properties of biomarkers with metabolic activity and analyzing multi-OMICS data it could be possible, with this methodology and research design, to identify early trends for molecular biology systems and genes involved in the fasted and fed states.","Bastarrachea, Raul ALaviada-Molina, Hugo ANava-Gonzalez, Edna JLeal-Berumen, IreneEscudero-Lourdes, ClaudiaEscalante-Araiza, FabiolaPeschard, Vanessa-GiselleVeloz-Garza, Rosa AHaack, KarinMartínez-Hernández, AngélicaBarajas-Olmos, Francisco MMolina-Segui, FernandaBuenfil-Rello, Fatima AGonzalez-Ramirez, LuciaJanssen-Aguilar, ReinhardLopez-Muñoz, RicardoPerez-Cetina, FernandaGaytan-Saucedo, Janeth FVaquera, ZoilaCornejo-Barrera, JudithCastillo-Pineda, Juan CarlosMurillo-Ramirez, AreliDiaz-Tena, Sara PFigueroa-Nuñez, BenignoGonzález-López, LauraSalinas-Osornio, Rocío AValencia-Rendón, Melesio EÁngeles-Chimal, JoséSanta-Olalla Tapia, JesúsRemes-Troche, José MValdovinos-Chavez, Salvador BHuerta-Avila, Eira EHan, XianlinOrozco, LorenaRodriguez-Ayala, ErnestoWeintraub, SusanGallegos-Cabrales, Esther CCole, Shelley AKent, Jack W Jr","Bastarrachea RALaviada-Molina HANava-Gonzalez EJLeal-Berumen IAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4640-7466Escudero-Lourdes CAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4597-1420Escalante-Araiza FPeschard VGVeloz-Garza RAHaack KMartínez-Hernández ABarajas-Olmos FMMolina-Segui FBuenfil-Rello FAGonzalez-Ramirez LJanssen-Aguilar RLopez-Muñoz RPerez-Cetina FAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4597-1420Gaytan-Saucedo JFVaquera ZCornejo-Barrera JCastillo-Pineda JCMurillo-Ramirez ADiaz-Tena SPFigueroa-Nuñez BGonzález-López LSalinas-Osornio RAValencia-Rendón MEÁngeles-Chimal JAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-0475-2798Santa-Olalla Tapia JAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3436-4163Remes-Troche JMAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8478-9659Valdovinos-Chavez SBHuerta-Avila EEHan XAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-8615-2413Orozco LRodriguez-Ayala EWeintraub SGallegos-Cabrales ECCole SAKent JW Jr","Department of Genetics, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX 78227-0549, USA. raul@txbiomed.org.Escuela de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Marista de Mérida, Mérida 97300, Mexico. hlaviada@marista.edu.mx.Facultad de Salud Pública y Nutrición (FASPyN), UANL, Monterrey 64460, Mexico. edna.navag@uanl.mx.Facultad de Medicina y Ciencias Biomédicas, Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua, Chihuahua 31125, Mexico. ileal@uach.mx.Facultad de Ciencias Químicas, Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí 78240, Mexico. cescuder@uaslp.mx.Centro de Investigación en Ciencias de la Salud (CICSA), Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Anáhuac Norte, Lomas Anahuac 52786, Mexico. fescara@gmail.com.Centro de Investigación en Ciencias de la Salud (CICSA), Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Anáhuac Norte, Lomas Anahuac 52786, Mexico. vanessa-gisellep@wustl.edu.Facultad de Enfermería, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León (UANL), Monterrey 64460, Mexico. rosyvelozgarza@hotmail.com.Department of Genetics, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX 78227-0549, USA. khaack@txbiomed.org.Laboratorio de Inmunogenómica y Enfermedades Metabólicas, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica, Ciudad de México C.P. 14610, Mexico. amartinez@inmegen.gob.mx.Laboratorio de Inmunogenómica y Enfermedades Metabólicas, Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica, Ciudad de México C.P. 14610, Mexico. fbarajas@inmegen.gob.mx.Escuela de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Marista de Mérida, Mérida 97300, Mexico. fmolina@marista.edu.mx.Escuela de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Marista de Mérida, Mérida 97300, Mexico. ln.fatimabuenfil@hotmail.com.Escuela de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Marista de Mérida, Mérida 97300, Mexico. nut.lucia.gonzalez@hotmail.com.Escuela de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Marista de Mérida, Mérida 97300, Mexico. rjanssen91@gmail.com.Escuela de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Marista de Mérida, Mérida 97300, Mexico.

METHODS: We used 657 serum samples, held under differing storage conditions, from the Scania Diabetes Registry (SDR) and Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research Tayside (GoDARTS), and a further 183 nested case-control sample set from the Collaborative Atorvastatin in Diabetes Study (CARDS). We analysed 42 biomarkers measured on the SDR and GoDARTS samples by a variety of methods including standard ELISA, multiplexed ELISA (Luminex) and mass spectrometry. The subset of 21 Luminex biomarkers was also measured on the CARDS samples. We used the event definition of loss of >20% of baseline eGFR during follow-up from a baseline eGFR of 30-75 ml min(-1) [1.73 m](-2). A total of 403 individuals experienced an event during a median follow-up of 7 years. We used discrete-time logistic regression models with tenfold cross-validation to assess association of biomarker panels with loss of kidney function. RESULTS: Twelve biomarkers showed significant association with eGFR decline adjusted for covariates in one or more of the sample sets when evaluated singly. Kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) and β(2)-microglobulin (B2M) showed the most consistent effects, with standardised odds ratios for progression of at least 1.4 (p < 0.0003) in all cohorts. A combination of B2M and KIM-1 added to clinical covariates, including baseline eGFR and albuminuria, modestly improved prediction, increasing the area under the curve in the SDR, Go-DARTS and CARDS by 0.079, 0.073 and 0.239, respectively. Neither the inclusion of additional Luminex biomarkers on top of B2M and KIM-1 nor a sparse mass spectrometry panel, nor the larger multiplatform panels previously identified, consistently improved prediction further across all validation sets. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Serum KIM-1 and B2M independently improve prediction of renal decline from an eGFR of 30-75 ml min(-1) [1.73 m](-2) in type 2 diabetes beyond clinical factors and prior eGFR and are robust to varying sample storage conditions. Larger panels of biomarkers did not improve prediction beyond these two biomarkers.","Colombo, MarcoLooker, Helen CFarran, BassamHess, SibylleGroop, LeifPalmer, Colin N ABrosnan, Mary JuliaDalton, R NeilWong, MaxTurner, CharlesAhlqvist, EmmaDunger, DavidAgakov, FelixDurrington, PaulLivingstone, ShonaBetteridge, JohnMcKeigue, Paul MColhoun, Helen M","Colombo MLooker HCFarran BHess SGroop LPalmer CNABrosnan MJDalton RNWong MTurner CAhlqvist EDunger DAgakov FDurrington PLivingstone SBetteridge JMcKeigue PMColhoun HM","Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.Population Health Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road South, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK.Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany.Lund University Diabetes Centre, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.Pfizer Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA.Evelina London Children's Hospital, Guy's & St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.Evelina London Children's Hospital, Guy's & St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.Evelina London Children's Hospital, Guy's & St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.Lund University Diabetes Centre, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden.Department of Paediatrics, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.Pharmatics Limited, Edinburgh, UK.Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.Population Health Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK.Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes, University College London Hospitals, London, UK.Usher Institute of Population Health Sciences and Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Crewe Road South, Edinburgh, EH4 2XU, UK. helen.colhoun@igmm.ed.ac.uk.NHS Fife, Fife, UK. helen.colhoun@igmm.ed.ac.uk.","eng","ETM/47/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United KingdomDH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom","Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20181005","Germany","Diabetologia","Diabetologia","0006777","0 (Biomarkers)0 (HAVCR1 protein, human)0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 1)0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)","IM","AgedBiomarkers/*bloodDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/*pathologyDiabetic Nephropathies/blood/pathologyDisease ProgressionEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent AssayFemaleGlomerular Filtration Rate/physiologyHepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 1/*bloodHumansKidney/pathologyMaleMass SpectrometryMiddle AgedOdds Ratiobeta 2-Microglobulin/*blood","PMC6290680",NA,"NOTNLM","Clinical scienceEpidemiologyNephropathyProteomics/metabolomics","HMC received research support, travel expenses and honorarium and is also a member of the advisory panels and speaker’s bureaus for Sanofi-Aventis, Regeneron and Eli Lilly.

This study assessed 80 cardiovascular and inflammatory proteins for biomarker discovery and prediction of MACE in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We combined data from six prospective epidemiological studies of 30-77-year-old individuals with type 2 diabetes in whom 80 circulating proteins were measured by proximity extension assay. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression was used in a discovery/replication design to identify biomarkers for incident MACE. We used gradient-boosted machine learning and lasso regularised Cox regression in a random 75% training subsample to assess whether adding proteins to risk factors included in the Swedish National Diabetes Register risk model would improve the prediction of MACE in the separate 25% test subsample. RESULTS: Of 1211 adults with type 2 diabetes (32% women), 211 experienced a MACE over a mean (±SD) of 6.4 ± 2.3 years. We replicated associations (<5% false discovery rate) between risk of MACE and eight proteins: matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12, IL-27 subunit α (IL-27a), kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23, protein S100-A12, TNF receptor (TNFR)-1, TNFR-2 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL-R)2. Addition of the 80-protein assay to established risk factors improved discrimination in the separate test sample from 0.686 (95% CI 0.682, 0.689) to 0.748 (95% CI 0.746, 0.751). A sparse model of 20 added proteins achieved a C statistic of 0.747 (95% CI 0.653, 0.842) in the test sample. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We identified eight protein biomarkers, four of which are novel, for risk of MACE in community residents with type 2 diabetes, and found improved risk prediction by combining multiplex proteomics with an established risk model. Multiprotein arrays could be useful in identifying individuals with type 2 diabetes who are at highest risk of a cardiovascular event.","Nowak, ChristophCarlsson, Axel CÖstgren, Carl JohanNyström, Fredrik HAlam, MoududFeldreich, TobiasSundström, JohanCarrero, Juan-JesusLeppert, JerzyHedberg, PärHenriksen, EgilCordeiro, Antonio CGiedraitis, VilmantasLind, LarsIngelsson, ErikFall, ToveÄrnlöv, Johan","Nowak CCarlsson ACÖstgren CJNyström FHAlam MFeldreich TSundström JCarrero JJLeppert JHedberg PHenriksen ECordeiro ACGiedraitis VLind LIngelsson EFall TÄrnlöv J","Division of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society (NVS), Karolinska Institutet, Alfred Nobels Allé 23, SE 14183, Huddinge, Sweden.Division of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society (NVS), Karolinska Institutet, Alfred Nobels Allé 23, SE 14183, Huddinge, Sweden.Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.School of Technology and Business Studies/Statistics, Dalarna University, Falun, Sweden.School of Health and Social Studies, Dalarna University, Falun, Sweden.Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Centre for Clinical Research, Uppsala University, Västerås, Sweden.Centre for Clinical Research, Uppsala University, Västerås, Sweden.Centre for Clinical Research, Uppsala University, Västerås, Sweden.Department of Hypertension and Nephrology, Dante Pazzanese Institute of Cardiology, São Paulo, Brazil.Department of Public Health and Caring Sciences, Geriatrics, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Division of Family Medicine and Primary Care, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society (NVS), Karolinska Institutet, Alfred Nobels Allé 23, SE 14183, Huddinge, Sweden. johan.arnlov@ki.se.School of Health and Social Studies, Dalarna University, Falun, Sweden. johan.arnlov@ki.se.","eng","2015-03477/Vetenskapsrådet/International932/Sparbanksstiftelsen Nya/International20150429/Hjärt-Lungfonden/International634869/European Union Horizon 2020/International","Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20180524","Germany","Diabetologia","Diabetologia","0006777","0 (Biomarkers)0 (FGF23 protein, human)7Q7P4S7RRE (Fibroblast Growth Factor-23)","IM","AdultAgedAtherosclerosis/metabolismBiomarkers/metabolismCardiovascular Diseases/*complications/*diagnosisDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications/*diagnosisFemaleFibroblast Growth Factor-23HumansInflammationMaleMiddle AgedProportional Hazards ModelsProteomics/*methodsRisk FactorsSweden","PMC6061158",NA,"NOTNLM","BiomarkersMajor adverse cardiovascular eventProteomicsRiskType 2 diabetes","EI is a scientific advisor for Olink Proteomics for projects unrelated to the present study.

Characterized mainly by irregular menses, hirsutism, skewed LH: FSH ratios and bulky polycystic ovaries, this multifactorial endocrinopathy results in unfavorable reproductive and metabolic sequelae, including anovulatory infertility, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease in later years. Increasing evidence has shown that the manifestation of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is attributable to a cumulative impact of altered genetic, epigenetic and protein profiles which bring about a systemic dysfunction. While genetic approaches help ascertain role of causal variants in its etiology, tissue-specific epigenetic patterns help in deciphering the auxiliary role of environmental, nutritional and behavioral factors. Proteomics is advantageous, linking both genotype and phenotype and contributing to biomarker discovery. Investigating molecular mechanism underlying PCOS is imperative in order to gain insight into the pathophysiology of PCOS and formulate novel diagnostic and treatment strategies. In this review we have summarized these three aspects, which have been successfully utilized to delineate the pathomechanisms of PCOS.","Sagvekar, PoojaDadachanji, RoshanPatil, KrutikaMukherjee, Srabani","Sagvekar PDadachanji RPatil KMukherjee S","Department of Molecular Endocrinology, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (ICMR), J.M.

We used a novel high-throughput 92-protein assay to identify circulating biomarkers for HOMA of IR in two cohorts of community residents without diabetes (n = 1,367) (mean age 73 ± 3.6 years). Adjusted linear regression identified cathepsin D and confirmed six proteins (leptin, renin, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1ra], hepatocyte growth factor, fatty acid-binding protein 4, and tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA]) as IR biomarkers. Mendelian randomization analysis indicated a positive causal effect of IR on t-PA concentrations. Two biomarkers, IL-1ra (hazard ratio [HR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59) and t-PA (HR 1.30, 1.02-1.65) were associated with incident T2D, and t-PA predicted 5-year transition to hyperglycemia (odds ratio 1.30, 95% CI 1.02-1.65). Additional adjustment for fasting glucose rendered both coefficients insignificant and revealed an association between renin and T2D (HR 0.79, 0.62-0.99). LASSO regression suggested a risk model including IL-1ra, t-PA, and the Framingham Offspring Study T2D score, but prediction improvement was nonsignificant (difference in C-index 0.02, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.12) over the T2D score only. In conclusion, proteomic blood profiling indicated cathepsin D as a new IR biomarker and suggested a causal effect of IR on t-PA.","Nowak, ChristophSundström, JohanGustafsson, StefanGiedraitis, VilmantasLind, LarsIngelsson, ErikFall, Tove","Nowak CSundström JGustafsson SGiedraitis VLind LIngelsson EFall T","Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Epidemiology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Department of Medical Sciences, Cardiovascular Epidemiology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Epidemiology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Department of Public Health and Caring Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Department of Medical Sciences, Cardiovascular Epidemiology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Epidemiology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K. Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Epidemiology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden tove.fall@medsci.uu.se.","eng","R01 DK106236/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20150929","United States","Diabetes","Diabetes","0372763","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Glucose)0 (FABP4 protein, human)0 (Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins)0 (HGF protein, human)0 (IL1RN protein, human)0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)0 (Leptin)67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)EC 3.4.23.15 (Renin)EC 3.4.23.5 (CTSD protein, human)EC 3.4.23.5 (Cathepsin D)","IM","AgedAged, 80 and overBiomarkers/bloodBlood Glucose/*metabolismCathepsin D/*bloodCausalityCohort StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*blood/epidemiologyFatty Acid-Binding Proteins/*bloodFemaleHepatocyte Growth Factor/*bloodHigh-Throughput Screening AssaysHumans*Insulin ResistanceInterleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein/*bloodLeptin/*bloodLinear ModelsLongitudinal StudiesMaleMendelian Randomization AnalysisProportional Hazards ModelsProspective StudiesProteomicsRenin/*bloodRisk AssessmentSweden/epidemiologyTissue Plasminogen Activator/*blood","PMC5860375",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2015/10/01 06:00","2016/04/29 06:00","2017/01/01","2015/10/01 06:00","2015/07/07 00:00 [received]2015/09/21 00:00 [accepted]2015/10/01 06:00 [entrez]2015/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]2016/04/29 06:00 [medline]2017/01/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","db15-0881 [pii]0881 [pii]10.2337/db15-0881 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes. 2016 Jan;65(1):276-84. doi: 10.2337/db15-0881.

ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), a key enzyme in cellular lipid production, was identified as a palmitate target in a proteomic screen. We investigated the effects of palmitate on ACLY activity and phosphorylation and its role in beta cell ER stress and apoptosis. We demonstrated that treatment of MIN6 cells, mouse islets and human islets with palmitate reduced ACLY protein levels. These in vitro results were validated by our finding that islets from high fat-fed mice had a significant decrease in ACLY, similar to that previously observed in type 2 diabetic human islets. Palmitate decreased intracellular acetyl-CoA levels to a similar degree as the ACLY inhibitor, SB-204990, suggesting a reduction in ACLY activity. ACLY inhibitors alone were sufficient to induce CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologues protein (CHOP)-dependent ER stress and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Similarly, even modest shRNA-mediated knockdown of ACLY caused a significant increase in beta cell apoptosis and ER stress. The effects of chemical ACLY inhibition and palmitate were non-additive and therefore potentially mediated by a common mechanism. Indeed, overexpression of ACLY prevented palmitate-induced beta cell death.

T2D is moreover a dual disease, with components of beta-cell failure and components of insulin resistance in peripheral organs, such as liver, fat, and muscle. Understanding the pathogenesis of the disease by gaining insight into the molecular pathways involved in both phenomena is one of the major assets of proteomic approaches. Moreover, proteomics and peptidomics may provide us with robust biomarkers for beta-cell failure, insulin resistance in pheripheral organs, but also for the development of diabetic complications.

With worldwide progress in the analysis of whole genomes, the knowledge base in gene sequence and expression data useful for protein and peptide analysis has drastically increased. The medical need for relevant biomarkers is enormous. This is particularly true for the many types of cancer, but other diseases such as Type 2 diabetes also lack useful and adequate diagnostic markers with high specificity and sensitivity. Despite advances in imaging technologies for early detection of diseases, proteomic and peptidomic multiplex techniques have evolved in recent years. This review focuses on the application of peptidomics technologies to peptides in health and disease. Peptidomics technologies provide new opportunities for the detection of low-molecular-weight proteome biomarkers (peptides) by mass spectrometry. Improvements in peptidomics research are based on separation of peptides and/or proteins by their physicochemical properties in combination with mass spectrometric detection, identification and sophisticated bioinformatics tools for data analysis. Therefore, peptidomics technologies offer an opportunity to discover novel biomarkers for diagnosis and management of disease (e.g., prognosis, treatment decision and monitoring response to therapy).","Schulte, ImkeTammen, HaraldSelle, HartmutSchulz-Knappe, Peter","Schulte ITammen HSelle HSchulz-Knappe P","BioVisioN AG, Feodor-Lynen-Str. 5, 30625 Hannover, Germany. i.schulte@biovision-discovery.de","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleReview",NA,"England","Expert Rev Mol Diagn","Expert review of molecular diagnostics","101120777","0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)0 (Peptides)","IM","AnimalsBiomarkers, Tumor/*analysisBody Fluids/*metabolismDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/diagnosis/*metabolismHumansNeoplasms/diagnosis/*metabolismPeptides/*analysisProteomicsRF   33",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2005/04/19 09:00","2005/07/08 09:00",NA,"2005/04/19 09:00","2005/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]2005/07/08 09:00 [medline]2005/04/19 09:00 [entrez]","ERM050206 [pii]10.1586/14737159.5.2.145 [doi]","ppublish","Expert Rev Mol Diagn. 2005 Mar;5(2):145-57. doi: 10.1586/14737159.5.2.145.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2005

This study aimed to investigate the association of plasma proteins with all-cause and cause-specific mortality among individuals with and without baseline type 2 diabetes (T2D) and evaluate their impact on the prediction of all-cause mortality in two prospective Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) studies. METHODS: The discovery cohort comprised 1545 participants (median follow-up 15.6 years; 244 with T2D: 116 total, 62 cardiovascular, 31 cancer-related and 23 other-cause deaths; 1301 without T2D: 321 total, 114 cardiovascular, 120 cancer-related and 87 other-cause deaths). The validation cohort comprised 1031 participants (median follow-up 6.9 years; 203 with T2D: 76 total, 45 cardiovascular, 19 cancer-related and 12 other-cause deaths; 828 without T2D: 169 total, 74 cardiovascular, 39 cancer-related and 56 other-cause deaths). We used Cox regression to examine associations of 233 plasma proteins with all-cause and cause-specific mortality and Lasso regression to construct prediction models for all-cause mortality stratifying by baseline T2D. C-index, category-free net reclassification index (cfNRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were conducted to evaluate the predictive performance of built prediction models. RESULTS: Thirty-five and 62 proteins, with 29 overlapping, were positively associated with all-cause mortality in the group with and without T2D, respectively. Out of these, in the group with T2D, 35, eight, and 26 were positively associated with cardiovascular, cancer-related, and other-cause mortality, while in the group without T2D, 55, 41, and 47 were positively associated with respective cause-specific outcomes in the pooled analysis of both cohorts. Regulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) transport and uptake by IGF-binding proteins emerged as a unique pathway enriched for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with T2D. The combined model containing the selected proteins (five and 12 proteins, with four overlapping, in the group with and without T2D, respectively) and clinical risk factors improved the prediction of all-cause mortality by C-index, cfNRI, and IDI. CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovered shared and unique mortality-related proteins in persons with and without T2D and emphasized the role of proteins in improving the prediction of mortality in different T2D subgroups.","Luo, HongPetrera, AgneseHauck, Stefanie MRathmann, WolfgangHerder, ChristianGieger, ChristianHoyer, AnnikaPeters, AnnetteThorand, Barbara","Luo HPetrera AHauck SMRathmann WHerder CGieger CHoyer APeters AThorand B","Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology (IBE), Faculty of Medicine, Pettenkofer School of Public Health, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.Metabolomics and Proteomics Core, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Metabolomics and Proteomics Core, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner München-Neuherberg, Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Biometrics and Epidemiology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner Düsseldorf, Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner Düsseldorf, Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Clinical Diabetology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.Department of Endocrinology and Diabetology, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Düsseldorf, Heinrich Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner München-Neuherberg, Neuherberg, Germany.Research Unit of Molecular Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Biostatistics and Medical Biometry, Medical School OWL, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology (IBE), Faculty of Medicine, Pettenkofer School of Public Health, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner München-Neuherberg, Neuherberg, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany. barbara.thorand@helmholtz-munich.de.Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology (IBE), Faculty of Medicine, Pettenkofer School of Public Health, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany. barbara.thorand@helmholtz-munich.de.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner München-Neuherberg, Neuherberg, Germany. barbara.thorand@helmholtz-munich.de.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20240927","England","BMC Med","BMC medicine","101190723","0 (Blood Proteins)0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Humans*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/mortality/bloodMaleFemaleMiddle AgedAged*Proteomics*Blood Proteins/analysisProspective StudiesBiomarkers/bloodCohort StudiesCardiovascular Diseases/mortality/bloodAdultNeoplasms/mortality/bloodGermany/epidemiology","PMC11438072",NA,"NOTNLM","All-cause mortalityCancer-related mortalityCardiovascular mortalityCohort studyOther-cause mortalityProteomicsType 2 diabetes","The authors declare no competing interests.","2024/09/28 22:44","2024/09/28 22:45","2024/09/27","2024/09/28 00:30","2024/04/03 00:00 [received]2024/09/13 00:00 [accepted]2024/09/28 22:45 [medline]2024/09/28 22:44 [pubmed]2024/09/28 00:30 [entrez]2024/09/27 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1186/s12916-024-03636-0 [pii]3636 [pii]10.1186/s12916-024-03636-0 [doi]","epublish","BMC Med. 2024 Sep 27;22(1):420. doi: 10.1186/s12916-024-03636-0.","© 2024.

This study uses untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry-based proteomics in two independent cohorts on two continents to decipher the mechanisms of DKD in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We conducted untargeted mass spectrometry on urine samples collected at the time of kidney biopsy from Korean patients with type 2 diabetes and biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy at Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH-DN cohort; n = 64). These findings were validated using targeted mass spectrometry in urine samples from a Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort subgroup with type 2 diabetes and DKD (CRIC-T2D; n = 282). Urinary biomarkers/pathways associated with kidney disease progression (doubling of serum creatinine, ≥50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rates, or the development of end-stage kidney disease) were identified. RESULTS: SNUH-DN patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 55 mL/min/1.73 m (2) (interquartile range [IQR], 44-75) and random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 3.1 g/g (IQR, 1.7-7.0). Urine proteins clustered into two groups, with cluster 2 having a 4.6-fold greater hazard (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-11.5) of disease progression than cluster 1 in multivariable-adjusted, time-to-event analyses. Proteins in cluster 2 mapped to 10 pathways, four of the top five of which were complement or complement-related. A high complement score, constructed from urine complement protein abundance, was strongly correlated to 4 of 5 histopathologic DN features and was associated with a 2.4-fold greater hazard (95% CI, 1.0-5.4) of disease progression than a low complement score. Targeted mass spectrometry of the CRIC-T2D participants, who had an eGFR of 42 mL/min/1.73 m (2) (IQR, 37-49) and 24-hr urine protein of 0.48 g (IQR, 0.10-1.87), showed that the complement score similarly segregated them into rapid and slow DKD progression groups. In both cohorts, the complement score had a linear association with disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary proteomic profiling confirms the association between the complement pathway and rapid DKD progression in two independent cohorts. These results suggest a need to further investigate complement pathway inhibition as a novel treatment for DKD.","Yun, DonghwanBae, SohyunGao, YuqianLopez, LaurenHan, DohyunNicora, Carrie DKim, Tae YounMoon, Kyung ChulKim, Dong KiFillmore, Thomas LKim, Yon SuRosenberg, Avi ZWang, WeijieSarder, PinakiQian, Wei-JunAfkarian, MaryamHan, Seung Seok","Yun DAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6566-5183Bae SAUID ORCID: 0009-0008-9620-2104Gao YLopez LHan DAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-0841-1598Nicora CDKim TYAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2896-5424Moon KCKim DKAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5195-7852Fillmore TLKim YSAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-3091-2388Rosenberg AZAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2356-950XWang WSarder PAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2450-5233Qian WJAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-5393-2827Afkarian MAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8428-8264Han SSAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-0137-5261",NA,"eng",NA,"Journal ArticlePreprint","20240817","United States","medRxiv","medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences","101767986",NA,NA,NA,"PMC11361241",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2024/08/31 09:46","2024/08/31 09:47","2024/08/29","2024/08/30 04:30","2024/08/31 09:47 [medline]2024/08/31 09:46 [pubmed]2024/08/30 04:30 [entrez]2024/08/29 00:00 [pmc-release]","2024.08.15.24312080 [pii]10.1101/2024.08.15.24312080 [doi]","epublish","medRxiv [Preprint]. 2024 Aug 17:2024.08.15.24312080. doi: 10.1101/2024.08.15.24312080.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1101/2024.08.15.24312080","2024.08.15.24312080",2024

However, our understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remains incomplete and good biomarkers to objectively assess physical activity are lacking. METHODS: We analyzed 3072 serum proteins in 26 men, normal weight or overweight, undergoing 12 weeks of a combined strength and endurance exercise intervention. We estimated insulin sensitivity with hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, maximum oxygen uptake, muscle strength, and used MRI/MRS to evaluate body composition and organ fat depots. Muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were used for mRNA sequencing. Additional association analyses were performed in samples from up to 47,747 individuals in the UK Biobank, as well as using two-sample Mendelian randomization and mice models. RESULTS: Following 12 weeks of exercise intervention, we observed significant changes in 283 serum proteins. Notably, 66 of these proteins were elevated in overweight men and positively associated with liver fat before the exercise regimen, but were normalized after exercise. Furthermore, for 19.7 and 12.1% of the exercise-responsive proteins, corresponding changes in mRNA expression levels in muscle and fat, respectively, were shown. The protein CD300LG displayed consistent alterations in blood, muscle, and fat. Serum CD300LG exhibited positive associations with insulin sensitivity, and to angiogenesis-related gene expression in both muscle and fat. Furthermore, serum CD300LG was positively associated with physical activity and negatively associated with glucose levels in the UK Biobank. In this sample, the association between serum CD300LG and physical activity was significantly stronger in men than in women. Mendelian randomization analysis suggested potential causal relationships between levels of serum CD300LG and fasting glucose, 2 hr glucose after an oral glucose tolerance test, and HbA1c. Additionally, Cd300lg responded to exercise in a mouse model, and we observed signs of impaired glucose tolerance in male, but not female, Cd300lg knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified several novel proteins in serum whose levels change in response to prolonged exercise and were significantly associated with body composition, liver fat, and glucose homeostasis. Serum CD300LG increased with physical activity and is a potential causal link to improved glucose levels. CD300LG may be a promising exercise biomarker and a therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes.

However, research specifically focusing on the ratios of plasma proteins in type 2 diabetes remains relatively scarce. METHODS: This study primarily employed a two-sample, two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, leveraging genetic data from several large, publicly accessible genome-wide association studies, wherein single nucleotide polymorphisms served as proxies for exposures and diseases. Within this framework, we applied two-sample MR to assess the associations between the 2821 plasma protein-to-protein ratios and type 2 diabetes along with its complications and utilized reverse MR to confirm the unidirectionality of these causal relationships. In addition, we employed two-step MR to investigate the potential mediating role of body mass index in these associations. To augment the robustness of our findings, we systematically implemented a series of sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The results gleaned from the inverse-variance weighted method elucidated that a cumulative sum of 23 protein-to-protein ratios bore a causal nexus with type 2 diabetes across both sample cohorts. With each incremental elevation of 1 standard deviation in the genetically anticipated protein-to-protein ratio, the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes oscillated from 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.87, 1.00) for the CNTN3/NCSS1 protein level ratio to 1.13 (1.06, 1.22) for the DBNL/NCK2 protein level ratio. Moreover, a tally of eight protein-to-protein ratios correlated with a minimum of one complication linked to type 2 diabetes. Diverse sensitivity analyses corroborated the robustness of these observations. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of our investigation unveiled correlations between 23 plasma protein-to-protein ratios and type 2 diabetes, with eight of these ratios entwined with complications of type 2 diabetes. These discoveries offer novel perspectives on the diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes and its associated complications.","Zhang, Yue-YangChen, Bing-XueYang, QinWan, Qin","Zhang YYChen BXYang QWan QAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-7765-1416","Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.Metabolic Vascular Disease Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Luzhou, China.Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolism, Luzhou, China.Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Nephropathy, Luzhou, China.Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases Key Laboratory of Luzhou, Luzhou, China.Department of Ultrasound Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.Metabolic Vascular Disease Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Luzhou, China.Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolism, Luzhou, China.Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Nephropathy, Luzhou, China.Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases Key Laboratory of Luzhou, Luzhou, China.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.Metabolic Vascular Disease Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Luzhou, China.Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Diabetes and Metabolism, Luzhou, China.Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Nephropathy, Luzhou, China.Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases Key Laboratory of Luzhou, Luzhou, China.","eng","2016YFC0901200/Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China/2022YFS0612/Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province/","Journal Article","20240718","England","Diabetes Obes Metab","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism","100883645","0 (Blood Proteins)","IM","*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/genetics/complicationsHumans*Mendelian Randomization Analysis*Proteomics/methods*Genome-Wide Association Study*Blood Proteins/analysis/genetics*Polymorphism, Single NucleotideBody Mass IndexDiabetes Complications/blood/geneticsFemaleMale",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","Mendelian randomizationcomplicationsplasma protein ratioproteomicstype 2 diabetes",NA,"2024/07/18 06:42","2024/09/18 12:49",NA,"2024/07/18 04:33","2024/06/26 00:00 [revised]2024/06/06 00:00 [received]2024/06/28 00:00 [accepted]2024/09/18 12:49 [medline]2024/07/18 06:42 [pubmed]2024/07/18 04:33 [entrez]","10.1111/dom.15792 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes Obes Metab. 2024 Oct;26(10):4410-4417. doi: 10.1111/dom.15792.

Given the crucial role of proteins in various biological processes, this study aimed to elucidate the aetiological role and predictive performance of protein biomarkers on incident CHD in individuals with and without T2D. METHODS: The discovery cohort included 1492 participants from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) S4 study with 147 incident CHD cases (45 vs. 102 cases in the group with T2D and without T2D, respectively) during 15.6 years of follow-up. The validation cohort included 888 participants from the KORA-Age1 study with 70 incident CHD cases (19 vs. 51 cases in the group with T2D and without T2D, respectively) during 6.9 years of follow-up. We measured 233 plasma proteins related to cardiovascular disease and inflammation using proximity extension assay technology. Associations of proteins with incident CHD were assessed using Cox regression and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Predictive models were developed using priority-Lasso and were evaluated on top of Framingham risk score variables using the C-index, category-free net reclassification index (cfNRI), and relative integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). RESULTS: We identified two proteins associated with incident CHD in individuals with and 29 in those without baseline T2D, respectively. Six of these proteins are novel candidates for incident CHD. MR suggested a potential causal role for hepatocyte growth factor in CHD development. The developed four-protein-enriched model for individuals with baseline T2D (ΔC-index: 0.017; cfNRI: 0.253; IDI: 0.051) and the 12-protein-enriched model for individuals without baseline T2D (ΔC-index: 0.054; cfNRI: 0.462; IDI: 0.024) consistently improved CHD prediction in the discovery cohort, while in the validation cohort, significant improvements were only observed for selected performance measures (with T2D: cfNRI: 0.633; without T2D: ΔC-index: 0.038; cfNRI: 0.465). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified novel protein biomarkers associated with incident CHD in individuals with and without T2D and reaffirmed previously reported protein candidates. These findings enhance our understanding of CHD pathophysiology and provide potential targets for prevention and treatment.","Luo, HongHuemer, Marie-TheresPetrera, AgneseHauck, Stefanie MRathmann, WolfgangHerder, ChristianKoenig, WolfgangHoyer, AnnikaPeters, AnnetteThorand, Barbara","Luo HHuemer MTPetrera AHauck SMRathmann WHerder CKoenig WHoyer APeters AThorand B","Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Ingolstaedter Landstraße 1, D-85764, Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology (IBE), Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Pettenkofer School of Public Health, Munich, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Ingolstaedter Landstraße 1, D-85764, Neuherberg, Germany.Metabolomics and Proteomics Core, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.Metabolomics and Proteomics Core, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner München-Neuherberg, Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Biometrics and Epidemiology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine Universität, Düsseldorf, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner Düsseldorf, Neuherberg, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner Düsseldorf, Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Clinical Diabetology, German Diabetes Center, Leibniz Center for Diabetes Research at Heinrich Heine Universität, Düsseldorf, Germany.Department of Endocrinology and Diabetology, Medical Faculty and University Hospital Düsseldorf, Heinrich Heine Universität, Düsseldorf, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology and Medical Biometry, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.Deutsches Herzzentrum München, Technische Universität München, Munich, Germany.German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner Site Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany.Biostatistics and Medical Biometry, Medical School OWL, Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Ingolstaedter Landstraße 1, D-85764, Neuherberg, Germany.Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology (IBE), Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Pettenkofer School of Public Health, Munich, Germany.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner München-Neuherberg, Neuherberg, Germany.German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner Site Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany.Institute of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (GmbH), Ingolstaedter Landstraße 1, D-85764, Neuherberg, Germany. barbara.thorand@helmholtz-munich.de.Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry and Epidemiology (IBE), Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Pettenkofer School of Public Health, Munich, Germany. barbara.thorand@helmholtz-munich.de.German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), Partner München-Neuherberg, Neuherberg, Germany. barbara.thorand@helmholtz-munich.de.","eng",NA,"Journal Article","20240203","England","Cardiovasc Diabetol","Cardiovascular diabetology","101147637","0 (Biomarkers)","IM","Humans*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/diagnosis/epidemiologyProteomicsRisk Assessment*Coronary Disease/diagnosis/epidemiologyRisk FactorsBiomarkers","PMC10838466",NA,"NOTNLM","Cohort studyCoronary heart diseaseMendelian randomizationProteomicsType 2 diabetes","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.","2024/02/04 00:42","2024/02/05 06:43","2024/02/03","2024/02/03 23:28","2023/11/13 00:00 [received]2024/01/22 00:00 [accepted]2024/02/05 06:43 [medline]2024/02/04 00:42 [pubmed]2024/02/03 23:28 [entrez]2024/02/03 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1186/s12933-024-02143-z [pii]2143 [pii]10.1186/s12933-024-02143-z [doi]","epublish","Cardiovasc Diabetol. 2024 Feb 3;23(1):53. doi: 10.1186/s12933-024-02143-z.","© 2024.

METHODS: We conducted a case-subcohort study involving 610 PC cases and 623 subcohort participants with 92 protein biomarkers measured in baseline plasma samples. Genetically-instrumented T2D was derived using 86 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including insulin resistance (IR) SNPs. RESULTS: In observational analyses of 623 subcohort participants (mean age, 52 years; 61% women), T2D was positively associated with 13 proteins (SD difference: IL6: 0.52 [0.23-0.81]; IL10: 0.41 [0.12-0.70]), of which 8 were nominally associated with incident PC. The 8 proteins potentially mediated 36.9% (18.7-75.0%) of the association between T2D and PC. In MR, no associations were observed for genetically-determined T2D with proteins, but there were positive associations of genetically-determined IR with IL6 and IL10 (SD difference: 1.23 [0.05-2.41] and 1.28 [0.31-2.24]). In two-sample MR, fasting insulin was associated with both IL6 and PC, but no association was observed between IL6 and PC. CONCLUSIONS: Proteomics were likely to explain the association between T2D and PC, but were not causal mediators. Elevated fasting insulin driven by insulin resistance might explain the associations of T2D, proteomics, and PC.","Pang, YuanjieLv, JunWu, TingYu, CanqingGuo, YuChen, YipingYang, LingMillwood, Iona

We established the differential proteomic signatures of WAT in glucose-tolerant lean and obese individuals and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the response to 8 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Using a high-throughput and reproducible mass spectrometry-based proteomics pipeline, we identified 3773 proteins and found that most regulated proteins displayed progression in markers of dysfunctional WAT from lean to obese to T2D individuals and were highly associated with clinical measures such as insulin sensitivity and HbA1c. We propose that these distinct markers could serve as potential clinical biomarkers. HIIT induced only minor changes in the WAT proteome. This included an increase in WAT ferritin levels independent of obesity and T2D, and WAT ferritin levels were strongly correlated with individual insulin sensitivity. Together, we report a proteomic signature of WAT related to obesity and T2D and highlight an unrecognized role of human WAT iron metabolism in exercise training adaptations.","Larsen, Jeppe KjærgaardKruse, RikkeSahebekhtiari, NavidMoreno-Justicia, RogerGomez Jorba, GerardPetersen, Maria Hde Almeida, Martin EØrtenblad, NielsDeshmukh, Atul SHøjlund, Kurt","Larsen JKAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9304-1148Kruse RAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7969-1232Sahebekhtiari NAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9442-2260Moreno-Justicia RGomez Jorba GPetersen MHAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9502-1618de Almeida MEAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-1794-6137Ørtenblad NAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9060-4139Deshmukh ASAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-2278-1843Højlund KAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-0891-4224","Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Steno Diabetes Center Odense, Odense University Hospital, Odense C, Denmark.Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense C, Denmark.Steno Diabetes Center Odense, Odense University Hospital, Odense C, Denmark.Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense C, Denmark.Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Steno Diabetes Center Odense, Odense University Hospital, Odense C, Denmark.Steno Diabetes Center Odense, Odense University Hospital, Odense C, Denmark.Department of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.Department of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Steno Diabetes Center Odense, Odense University Hospital, Odense C, Denmark.Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense C, Denmark.","eng","NNF18CC0034900/Novo Nordisk Foundation (NNF) to NNF Center for Basic Metabolic Research/NNF19SA058976/EFSD/Novo Nordisk Foundation Future Leaders Awards Program to A.S.D./NNF15OC0015986/Region of Southern Denmark, Odense University Hospital, the Novo Nordisk Foundation/19/37137/University of Southern Denmark, Region of Southern Denmark/","Journal Article","20231129","United States","Sci Adv","Science advances","101653440","9007-73-2 (Ferritins)","IM","Humans*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2*Insulin Resistance/physiologyProteomicsAdipose Tissue, White/metabolismObesity/metabolismExerciseFerritins/metabolismAdipose Tissue/metabolism","PMC10686561",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2023/11/29 18:42","2023/12/01 06:45","2023/11/29","2023/11/29 14:03","2023/12/01 06:45 [medline]2023/11/29 18:42 [pubmed]2023/11/29 14:03 [entrez]2023/11/29 00:00 [pmc-release]","adi7548 [pii]10.1126/sciadv.adi7548 [doi]","ppublish","Sci Adv. 2023 Dec;9(48):eadi7548. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.adi7548.

Current clinical tools cannot predict whether or not patients will respond to treatment with RAS inhibitors (RASi). We aimed to investigate whether proteome analysis could identify urinary peptides as biomarkers that could predict the response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin-receptor blockers treatment to avoid DKD progression. Furthermore, we investigated the comparability of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated using four different GFR equations, for DKD progression. METHODS: We evaluated urine samples from a discovery cohort of 199 diabetic patients treated with RASi. DKD progression was defined based on eGFR percentage slope results between visits (∼1 year) and for the entire period (∼3 years) based on the eGFR values of each GFR equation. Urine samples were analysed using capillary electrophoresis-coupled mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis was performed between the uncontrolled (patients who did not respond to RASi treatment) and controlled kidney function groups (patients who responded to the RASi treatment). Peptides were combined in a support vector machine-based model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the risk prediction models in two independent validation cohorts treated with RASi. RESULTS: The classification of patients into uncontrolled and controlled kidney function varies depending on the GFR equation used, despite the same sample set. We identified 227 peptides showing nominal significant difference and consistent fold changes between uncontrolled and controlled patients in at least three methods of eGFR calculation. These included fragments of collagens, alpha-1-antitrypsin, antithrombin-III, CD99 antigen and uromodulin. A model based on 189 of 227 peptides (DKDp189) showed a significant prediction of non-response to the treatment/DKD progression in two independent cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The DKDp189 model demonstrates potential as a predictive tool for guiding treatment with RASi in diabetic patients.","Jaimes Campos, Mayra AlejandraMavrogeorgis, EmmanouilLatosinska, AgnieszkaEder, SusanneBuchwinkler, LukasMischak, HaraldSiwy, JustynaRossing, PeterMayer, GertJankowski, Joachim","Jaimes Campos MAMavrogeorgis ELatosinska AEder SBuchwinkler LMischak HSiwy JRossing PMayer GJankowski JAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-4528-2967","Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH, Hannover, Germany.University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Institute for Molecular Cardiovascular Research, Aachen, Germany.Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH, Hannover, Germany.University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Institute for Molecular Cardiovascular Research, Aachen, Germany.Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH, Hannover, Germany.Department of Internal Medicine IV (Nephrology and Hypertension), Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.Department of Internal Medicine IV (Nephrology and Hypertension), Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH, Hannover, Germany.Mosaiques Diagnostics GmbH, Hannover, Germany.Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, Complications Research, Copenhagen, Denmark.Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Department of Internal Medicine IV (Nephrology and Hypertension), Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.Department of Internal Medicine IV (Nephrology and Hypertension), Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.Department of Pathology, Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht (CARIM), University of Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands.Aachen-Maastricht Institute for Cardiorenal Disease (AMICARE), University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.","eng","848011/European Union/101072828/European Commission/722609/European Commission/860329/European Commission/322900939/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/403224013/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/860329/European Union/SFB/TRR219/German Research Foundation/DFG-KFO 5011/German Research Foundation/CA21165/EU-Cost PerMedik/764 474/CaReSyAn/860329/Erzincan Üniversitesi/","Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"England","Nephrol Dial Transplant","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association  European Renal Association","8706402","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Peptides)0 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)0 (Antihypertensive Agents)","IM","HumansFemaleMale*Glomerular Filtration RateMiddle Aged*Diabetic Nephropathies/drug therapy/diagnosis/urine/etiology*Biomarkers/urinePeptides/urine/therapeutic useAgedAngiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic useRenin-Angiotensin System/drug effectsPrognosisDisease ProgressionFollow-Up StudiesBlood Pressure/drug effectsAntihypertensive Agents/therapeutic useHypertension/drug therapy/urine","PMC11181870",NA,"NOTNLM","CKDbiomarkersprogressiontype 2 diabetesurine proteomics","H.M. is the founder and co-owner of Mosaiques Diagnostics (Hannover, Germany).

We conducted proteomic association studies of incident type 2 diabetes and physiologic responses to an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) to identify novel protein contributors to glucose homeostasis and diabetes risk. We tested 4,776 SomaScan proteins measured in relation to 18-year incident diabetes risk in participants from the Cardiovascular Health Study (N = 2,631) and IVGTT-derived measures in participants from the HERITAGE Family Study (N = 752). We characterize 51 proteins that were associated with longitudinal diabetes risk, using their respective 39, 9, and 8 concurrent associations with insulin sensitivity index (SI), acute insulin response to glucose (AIRG), and glucose effectiveness (SG). Twelve of the 51 diabetes associations appear to be novel, including β-glucuronidase, which was associated with increased diabetes risk and lower SG, suggesting an alternative pathway to insulin for glucose disposal; and plexin-B2, which also was associated with increased diabetes risk, but with lower AIRG, and not with SI, indicating a mechanism related instead to pancreatic dysfunction. Other novel protein associations included alcohol dehydrogenase-1C, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase-B, sorbitol dehydrogenase with elevated type 2 diabetes risk, and a leucine-rich repeat containing protein-15 and myocilin with decreased risk. ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma proteins are associated with the risk of incident diabetes in older adults independent of various demographic, lifestyle, and biochemical risk factors. These same proteins are associated with subtle differences in measures of glucose homeostasis earlier in life. Proteins that are associated with lower insulin sensitivity in individuals without diabetes tend to be associated with appropriate compensatory mechanisms, such as a stronger acute insulin response or higher glucose effectiveness. Proteins that are associated with future diabetes risk, but not with insulin insensitivity, tend to be associated with lower glucose effectiveness and/or impaired acute insulin response.","Cronjé, Héléne TMi, Michael YAustin, Thomas RBiggs, Mary LSiscovick, David SLemaitre, Rozenn NPsaty, Bruce MTracy, Russell PDjoussé, LucKizer, Jorge RIx, Joachim HRao, PrashantRobbins, Jeremy MBarber, Jacob LSarzynski, Mark AClish, Clary BBouchard, ClaudeMukamal, Kenneth JGerszten, Robert EJensen, Majken K","Cronjé HTAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-6855-8324Mi MYAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8031-8948Austin TRBiggs MLSiscovick DSLemaitre RNAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-7038-1844Psaty BMTracy RPDjoussé LAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9902-3047Kizer JRAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9936-7803Ix JHRao PRobbins JMBarber JLSarzynski MAClish CBAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8259-9245Bouchard CMukamal KJGerszten REAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-6767-7687Jensen MK","Department of Public Health, Section of Epidemiology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.New York Academy of Medicine, New York, NY.Cardiovascular Health Research Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.Cardiovascular Health Research Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.Department of Epidemiology, Health Systems and Population Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.Department of Pathology Laboratory Medicine, Larner College of Medicine, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT.Division of Aging, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.Cardiology Section San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System, San Francisco, CA.Department of Medicine, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.Division of Nephrology-Hypertension, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Department of Exercise Science, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC.Department of Exercise Science, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC.Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, LA.Division of General Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.Department of Public Health, Section of Epidemiology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.Department of Nutrition, Harvard T.H.

Previously, we provided evidence that there is a significant insoluble fibrin amyloid microclot load in the circulation of individuals with long COVID, and that these microclots entrap a substantial number of inflammatory molecules, including those that might prevent clot breakdown. Scientifically, the most challenging aspect of this debilitating condition is that traditional pathology tests such as a serum CRP (C-reactive protein) may not show any significant abnormal inflammatory markers, albeit these tests measure only the soluble inflammatory molecules. Elevated, or abnormal soluble biomarkers such as IL-6, D-Dimer or fibrinogen indicate an increased risk for thrombosis or a host immune response in COVID-19. The absence of biomarkers in standard pathology tests, result in a significant amount of confusion for patients and clinicians, as patients are extremely sick or even bed-ridden but with no regular identifiable reason for their disease. Biomarkers that are currently available cannot detect the molecules present in the microclots we identified and are therefore unable to confirm their presence or the mechanisms that drive their formation. METHODS: Here we analysed the protein content of double-digested microclots of 99 long COVID patients and 29 healthy controls. The patients suffering from long COVID reported their symptoms through a questionnaire completed by themselves or their attending physician. RESULTS: Our long COVID cohort's symptoms were found to be in line with global findings, where the most prevalent symptoms were constant fatigue (74%,) cognitive impairment (71%) and depression and anxiety (30%). Our most noteworthy findings were a reduced level of plasma Kallikrein compared to our controls, an increased level of platelet factor 4 (PF4) von Willebrand factor (VWF), and a marginally increased level of α-2 antiplasmin (α-2-AP). We also found a significant presence of antibodies entrapped inside these microclots. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the presence of pro-inflammatory molecules that may also contribute to a failed fibrinolysis phenomenon, which could possibly explain why individuals with long COVID suffer from chronic fatigue, dyspnoea, or cognitive impairment. In addition, significant platelet hyperactivation was noted. Hyperactivation will result in the granular content of platelets being shed into the circulation, including PF4. Overall, our results provide further evidence of both a failed fibrinolytic system in long COVID/PASC and the entrapment of many proteins whose presence might otherwise go unrecorded. These findings might have significant implications for individuals with pre-existing comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.","Kruger, ArneauxVlok, MareTurner, SimoneVenter, ChantelleLaubscher, Gert JacobusKell, Douglas BPretorius, Etheresia","Kruger AVlok MTurner SVenter CLaubscher GJKell DBAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-5838-7963Pretorius EAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-9108-2384","Department of Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Stellenbosch University, Private Bag X1 Matieland, Stellenbosch, 7602, South Africa.Central Analytical Facility, Mass Spectrometry Stellenbosch University, Tygerberg Campus, Room 6054, Clinical Building, Francie Van Zijl Drive, Tygerberg, Cape Town, 7505, South Africa.Department of Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Stellenbosch University, Private Bag X1 Matieland, Stellenbosch, 7602, South Africa.Department of Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Stellenbosch University, Private Bag X1 Matieland, Stellenbosch, 7602, South Africa.Mediclinic Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, 7600, South Africa.Department of Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Stellenbosch University, Private Bag X1 Matieland, Stellenbosch, 7602, South Africa. dbk@liv.ac.uk.Department of Biochemistry and Systems Biology, Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 7ZB, UK. dbk@liv.ac.uk.The Novo Nordisk Foundation Centre for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark, Kemitorvet 200, 2800, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark. dbk@liv.ac.uk.Department of Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Stellenbosch University, Private Bag X1 Matieland, Stellenbosch, 7602, South Africa. resiap@sun.ac.za.Department of Biochemistry and Systems Biology, Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 7ZB, UK. resiap@sun.ac.za.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20220921","England","Cardiovasc Diabetol","Cardiovascular diabetology","101147637","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Interleukin-6)0 (alpha-2-Antiplasmin)0 (von Willebrand Factor)37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)9001-31-4 (Fibrin)9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)EC 3.4.21.34 (Plasma Kallikrein)","IM","BiomarkersC-Reactive Protein/metabolism*COVID-19/complications*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complicationsFibrin/metabolismFibrinogen/metabolismHumansInterleukin-6Plasma KallikreinPlatelet Factor 4Proteomics*Thrombosis/diagnosisalpha-2-Antiplasminvon Willebrand Factor/analysisPost-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome","PMC9491257",NA,"NOTNLM","AntibodiesFailed fibrinolysisKallikreinLong COVIDMicroclotsPlatelet factor 4Platelet hyperactivationvon Willebrand factor","EP is the managing director of BioCODE Technologies.","2022/09/22 06:00","2022/09/24 06:00","2022/09/21","2022/09/21 23:45","2022/07/28 00:00 [received]2022/09/07 00:00 [accepted]2022/09/21 23:45 [entrez]2022/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]2022/09/24 06:00 [medline]2022/09/21 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.1186/s12933-022-01623-4 [pii]1623 [pii]10.1186/s12933-022-01623-4 [doi]","epublish","Cardiovasc Diabetol. 2022 Sep 21;21(1):190. doi: 10.1186/s12933-022-01623-4.","© 2022.

Four independent cohorts encompassing 754 individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and early and late diabetic kidney disease were followed to ascertain progression to kidney failure. During ten years of follow-up, 227 of 754 individuals progressed to kidney failure. Using the SOMAscan proteomics platform, we measured baseline concentration of 1129 circulating proteins. In our previous publications, we analyzed 334 of these proteins that were members of specific candidate pathways involved in diabetic kidney disease and found 35 proteins strongly associated with risk of progression to kidney failure. Here, we examined the remaining 795 proteins using an untargeted approach. Of these remaining proteins, 11 were significantly associated with progression to kidney failure. Biological processes previously reported for these proteins were related to neuron development (DLL1, MATN2, NRX1B, KLK8, RTN4R and ROR1) and were implicated in the development of kidney fibrosis (LAYN, DLL1, MAPK11, MATN2, endostatin, and ROR1) in cellular and animal studies. Specific mechanisms that underlie involvement of these proteins in progression of diabetic kidney disease must be further investigated to assess their value as targets for kidney-protective therapies. Using multivariable LASSO regression analysis, five proteins (LAYN, ESAM, DLL1, MAPK11 and endostatin) were found independently associated with risk of progression to kidney failure.

The identification and validation of sensitidve, selective, and robust biomarkers for early diagnosis during the first trimester of pregnancy are required, as well as for the prediction of possible adverse outcomes after birth. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based omics technologies are nowadays the method of choice to characterize various pathologies at a molecular level. Proteomics and metabolomics of GDM were widely investigated in the last 10 years, and various proteins and metabolites were proposed as possible biomarkers. Metallomics of GDM was also reported, but studies are limited in number. The present review focuses on the description of the different analytical methods and MS-based instrumental platforms applied to GDM-related omics studies.

However, IAbs do not fully meet the need for the prediction and intervention of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Serological proteins should be great sources for biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to identify new proteomic biomarkers with the technology of an expression-based genome-wide association study (eGWAS) in children newly diagnosed with T1D. METHODS: In an attempt to identify additional biomarkers, we performed an eGWAS using microarray data from 169 arrays of the pancreatic islets of T1D rodents (78 T1D cases and 91 controls). We ranked all 16 099 protein-coding genes by the likelihood of differential expression in the pancreatic islets. Our top 20 secreted proteins were screened in 170 children including 100 newly diagnosed T1D, and 50 type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 20 age-matched healthy children. With 6 proteins showing significance, we further conducted a validation study using the second independent set of 400 samples from children including 200 newly diagnosed with T1D, 100 T2D, and 100 age-matched controls. RESULTS: We identified 2 serum proteins that were significantly changed in T1D vs both control and T2D, and 5 serum proteins were significantly changed both in T1D and T2D vs control. Serum osteopontin (OPN) levels were uniquely higher in T1D (T1D vs controls, P = 1.29E-13 ~ 9.38E-7, T1D vs T2D, P = 2.65E-8 ~ 1.58E-7) with no difference between T2D and healthy control individuals. Serum interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) levels were lower in T1D compared both with T2D (P = 3.36E-9~0.0236) and healthy participants (P = 1.09E-79 ~ 2.00E-12). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that OPN and IL1-RA could be candidates for useful biomarkers for T1D in children.","Jia, XiaofanToda, KyokoHe, LingMiao, DongmeiYamada, SatoruYu, LipingKodama, Keiichi","Jia XToda KHe LMiao DYamada SYu LAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-0664-2154Kodama KAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-8509-1199","Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA.Biomedical Research Center, Kitasato Institute Hospital, Kitasato University, Tokyo 108-8642, Japan.Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA.Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA.Diabetes Center, Kitasato Institute Hospital, Kitasato University, Tokyo 108-8642, Japan.Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA.Health Promotion Team, ORIX Group Health Insurance Society, ORIX Corporation, Tokyo 105-6135, Japan.Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Clinical Medicine Research Center, Sanno Medical Center, International University of Health and Welfare, Tokyo 107-8332, Japan.","eng","P30 DK116073/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States2-SRA-2019-695-S-B/JDRF/Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",NA,"United States","J Clin Endocrinol Metab","The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism","0375362","0 (Autoantibodies)0 (Biomarkers)0 (IL1RN protein, human)0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)","IM","AutoantibodiesBiomarkersChild*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/diagnosis/genetics*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/geneticsGenome-Wide Association StudyHumansInterleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein/*geneticsOsteopontin/geneticsProteomics","PMC9391606",NA,"NOTNLM","IL1-RAbiomarkereGWASosteopontinproteomicstype 1 diabetes",NA,"2022/04/24 06:00","2022/06/22 06:00","2023/04/23","2022/04/23 08:34","2021/09/27 00:00 [received]2022/04/24 06:00 [pubmed]2022/06/22 06:00 [medline]2022/04/23 08:34 [entrez]2023/04/23 00:00 [pmc-release]","6572806 [pii]dgac256 [pii]10.1210/clinem/dgac256 [doi]","ppublish","J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2022 Jun 16;107(7):1825-1832. doi: 10.1210/clinem/dgac256.","© The Author(s) 2022.

The paradigm change from reactive to predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (3PM/PPPM) has been declared as an essential transformation of the overall healthcare approach to benefit the patient and society at large. To this end, specific biomarker panels are instrumental for a cost-effective predictive approach of individualized prevention and treatments tailored to the person. The source of biomarkers is crucial for specificity and reliability of diagnostic tests and treatment targets. Furthermore, any diagnostic approach preferentially should be noninvasive to increase availability of the biomaterial, and to decrease risks of potential complications as well as concomitant costs. These requirements are clearly fulfilled by tear fluid, which represents a precious source of biomarker panels. The well-justified principle of a ""sick eye in a sick body"" makes comprehensive tear fluid biomarker profiling highly relevant not only for diagnostics of eye pathologies but also for prediction, prognosis, and treatment monitoring of systemic diseases. One prominent example is the Sicca syndrome linked to a cascade of severe complications that include dry eye, neurologic, and oncologic diseases. In this review, protein profiles in tear fluid are highlighted and corresponding biomarkers are exemplified for several relevant pathologies, including dry eye disease, diabetic retinopathy, cancers, and neurological disorders. Corresponding analytical approaches such as sample pre-processing, differential proteomics, electrophoretic techniques, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA), microarrays, and mass spectrometry (MS) methodology are detailed. Consequently, we proposed the overall strategies based on the tear fluid biomarkers application for 3P medicine practice. In the context of 3P medicine, tear fluid analytical pathways are considered to predict disease development, to target preventive measures, and to create treatment algorithms tailored to individual patient profiles.","Zhan, XianquanLi, JiajiaGuo, YunaGolubnitschaja, Olga","Zhan XLi JGuo YGolubnitschaja O","Shandong Key Laboratory of Radiation Oncology, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University, 440 Jiyan Road, Jinan, 250117 Shandong China.

Identification of biomarkers for the screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of diabetes and its complications and better understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the development and progression of diabetes can facilitate individualized prevention and treatment. With the advancement of analytical techniques, metabolomics can identify and quantify multiple biomarkers simultaneously in a high-throughput manner. Providing information on underlying metabolic pathways, metabolomics can further identify mechanisms of diabetes and its progression. The application of metabolomics in epidemiological studies have identified novel biomarkers for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications, such as branched-chain amino acids, metabolites of phenylalanine, metabolites involved in energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Metabolomics have also been applied to explore the potential pathways modulated by medications. Investigating diabetes using a systems biology approach by integrating metabolomics with other omics data, such as genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and clinical data can present a comprehensive metabolic network and facilitate causal inference. In this regard, metabolomics can deepen the molecular understanding, help identify potential therapeutic targets, and improve the prevention and management of T2D and its complications.

We employ mass spectrometry-based proteomics to systematically analyze islets from 9 genetic or diet-induced mouse models representing a broad cross-section of metabolic health. Quantifying the islet proteome to a depth of >11,500 proteins, this study represents the most detailed analysis of mouse islet proteins to date. Our data highlight that the majority of islet proteins are expressed in all strains and diets, but more than half of the proteins vary in expression levels, principally due to genetics. Associating these varied protein expression levels on an individual animal basis with individual phenotypic measures reveals islet mitochondrial function as a major positive indicator of metabolic health regardless of strain. This compendium of strain-specific and dietary changes to mouse islet proteomes represents a comprehensive resource for basic and translational islet cell biology.","Yau, BelindaNaghiloo, SheydaDiaz-Vegas, AlexisCarr, Austin VVan Gerwen, JulianNeedham, Elise JJevon, DillonChen, Sing-YoungHoehn, Kyle LBrandon, Amanda EMacia, LauranceCooney, Gregory JShortreed, Michael RSmith, Lloyd MKeller, Mark PThorn, PeterLarance, MarkJames, David EHumphrey, Sean JKebede, Melkam A","Yau BNaghiloo SDiaz-Vegas ACarr AVVan Gerwen JNeedham EJJevon DChen SYHoehn KLBrandon AEMacia LCooney GJShortreed MRSmith LMKeller MPThorn PLarance MJames DEHumphrey SJKebede MA","Discipline of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Camperdown 2006, Australia.Discipline of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Camperdown 2006, Australia.School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.Discipline of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Camperdown 2006, Australia.Department of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia.Department of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia.Department of Pharmacology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.Discipline of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Camperdown 2006, Australia.Discipline of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Camperdown 2006, Australia.Discipline of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Camperdown 2006, Australia.Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.Discipline of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Camperdown 2006, Australia.School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.Discipline of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Camperdown 2006, Australia.School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.Discipline of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Camperdown 2006, Australia.","eng","R01 CA193481/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States","Journal Article","20210909","United States","iScience","iScience","101724038EIN  iScience. 2023 Dec 14;27(1):108707. doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2023.108707.

To address this heterogeneity, investigators of a previous study clustered people with diabetes according to five diabetes subtypes. The aim of the current study is to investigate the etiology of these clusters by comparing their molecular signatures. In three independent cohorts, in total 15,940 individuals were clustered based on five clinical characteristics. In a subset, genetic (N = 12,828), metabolomic (N = 2,945), lipidomic (N = 2,593), and proteomic (N = 1,170) data were obtained in plasma. For each data type, each cluster was compared with the other four clusters as the reference. The insulin-resistant cluster showed the most distinct molecular signature, with higher branched-chain amino acid, diacylglycerol, and triacylglycerol levels and aberrant protein levels in plasma were enriched for proteins in the intracellular PI3K/Akt pathway. The obese cluster showed higher levels of cytokines. The mild diabetes cluster with high HDL showed the most beneficial molecular profile with effects opposite of those seen in the insulin-resistant cluster. This study shows that clustering people with type 2 diabetes can identify underlying molecular mechanisms related to pancreatic islets, liver, and adipose tissue metabolism. This provides novel biological insights into the diverse aetiological processes that would not be evident when type 2 diabetes is viewed as a homogeneous disease.","Slieker, Roderick CDonnelly, Louise

We aimed to identify differentially expressed circulating biomarkers in obese HFpEF patients and link them to disease severity and outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: From the LIFE-Heart study, 999 patients with HFpEF and 999 patients without heart failure (no-HF) were selected and 92 circulating serum biomarkers were measured using a proximity extension assay. Elevation of identified biomarkers was validated in 220 patients from the Aldo-DHF trial with diagnosed HFpEF. HFpEF patients were older and had more comorbidities including coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes as compared to no-HF patients (P < 0.05 for all). After adjusting for covariates, adrenomedullin (ADM), galectin-9 (Gal-9), thrombospondin-2 (THBS-2), CD4, and tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2) were significantly higher in obese HFpEF patients [body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m(2) , n = 464] as compared to lean HFpEF (BMI <30 kg/m(2) , n = 535) and obese no-HF patients (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2) , n = 387) (P < 0.001 for both); these findings were verified in the Aldo-DHF validation cohort (P < 0.001). Except for CD4 these proteins were associated with increased estimates of left atrial pressure in a linear fashion. Importantly, ADM and CD4 were associated with increased mortality in obese HFpEF patients after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSION: Obese HFpEF patients exhibit higher circulating biomarkers of volume expansion (ADM), myocardial fibrosis (THBS-2) and systemic inflammation (Gal-9, CD4) compared to obese non-HFpEF or lean HFpEF patients. These findings support the clinical definition of a distinct obese HFpEF phenotype and might merit further investigation.","Kresoja, Karl-PatrikRommel, Karl-PhilippWachter, RolfHenger, SylviaBesler, ChristianKlöting, NoraSchnelle, MoritzHoffmann, AnneBüttner, PetraCeglarek, UtaThiele, HolgerScholz, MarkusEdelmann, FrankBlüher, MatthiasLurz, Philipp","Kresoja KPRommel KPWachter RHenger SBesler CKlöting NSchnelle MHoffmann ABüttner PCeglarek UThiele HScholz MEdelmann FBlüher MLurz P","Department of Cardiology, Heart Center Leipzig at University Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.Department of Cardiology, Heart Center Leipzig at University Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.Clinic and Policlinic for Cardiology, University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany.Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.LIFE Research Centre for Civilization Diseases, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.Department of Cardiology, Heart Center Leipzig at University Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.Medical Department III  Endocrinology, Nephrology, Rheumatology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.Helmholtz Institute for Metabolic, Obesity and Vascular Research (HI-MAG) of the Helmholtz Zentrum München at the University of Leipzig and University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.Institute for Clinical Chemistry, University Medical Center Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany.Medical Department III  Endocrinology, Nephrology, Rheumatology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.Helmholtz Institute for Metabolic, Obesity and Vascular Research (HI-MAG) of the Helmholtz Zentrum München at the University of Leipzig and University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.Department of Cardiology, Heart Center Leipzig at University Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.Department of Cardiology, Heart Center Leipzig at University Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.LIFE Research Centre for Civilization Diseases, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.Department of Internal Medicine and Cardiology, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.German Centre for Cardiovascular Research, partner site Berlin, Germany.Medical Department III  Endocrinology, Nephrology, Rheumatology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.Helmholtz Institute for Metabolic, Obesity and Vascular Research (HI-MAG) of the Helmholtz Zentrum München at the University of Leipzig and University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.Department of Cardiology, Heart Center Leipzig at University Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20210720","England","Eur J Heart Fail","European journal of heart failure","100887595","0 (Biomarkers)","IMCIN  Eur J Heart Fail. 2021 Oct;23(10):1645-1647. doi: 10.1002/ejhf.2332.

Combining EWAS with deep molecular phenotyping, such as approaches enabled by metabolomics and proteomics, allows further probing of the underlying disease-associated pathways. For instance, methylation of the TXNIP gene is associated robustly with prevalent type 2 diabetes and further with metabolites that are short-term markers of glycaemic control. These associations reflect TXNIP's function as a glucose uptake regulator by interaction with the major glucose transporter GLUT1 and suggest that TXNIP methylation can be used as a read-out for the organism's exposure to glucose stress. Another case is the association between DNA methylation of the AHRR and F2RL3 genes with smoking and a protein that is involved in the reprogramming of the bronchial epithelium. These examples show that associations between DNA methylation and intermediate molecular traits can open new windows into how the body copes with physiological challenges. This knowledge, if carefully interpreted, may indicate novel therapy options and, together with monitoring of the methylation state of specific methylation sites, may in the future allow the early diagnosis of impending disease. It is essential for medical practitioners to recognize the potential that this field holds in translating basic research findings to clinical practice. In this review, we present recent advances in the field of EWAS with metabolomics and proteomics and discuss both the potential and the challenges of translating epigenetic associations, with deep molecular phenotypes, to biomedical applications.","Suhre, KZaghlool, S","Suhre KAUID ORCID: 0000-0001-9638-3912Zaghlool S","From the, Bioinformatics Core, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Education City, Doha, Qatar.Department of Biophysics and Physiology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, USA.From the, Bioinformatics Core, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Education City, Doha, Qatar.Department of Biophysics and Physiology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, USA.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tReview","20210522","England","J Intern Med","Journal of internal medicine","8904841","0 (Proteome)","IM","DNA Methylation*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/geneticsEpigenesis, Genetic*EpigenomeGenome-Wide Association StudyHumans*Metabolome*Proteome",NA,NA,"NOTNLM","DNA methylationepigeneticsgene regulationmetabolomicsproteomics",NA,"2021/04/28 06:00","2022/02/19 06:00",NA,"2021/04/27 08:46","2021/03/18 00:00 [revised]2021/02/26 00:00 [received]2021/03/22 00:00 [accepted]2021/04/28 06:00 [pubmed]2022/02/19 06:00 [medline]2021/04/27 08:46 [entrez]","10.1111/joim.13306 [doi]","ppublish","J Intern Med. 2021 Sep;290(3):527-548. doi: 10.1111/joim.13306.

The main features of PCOS are hyperandrogenism and irregular menstrual cycles together with metabolic dysfunctions including hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance and a 4-fold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Despite the high prevalence the pathophysiology of the syndrome is unclear. Insulin resistance in women with PCOS likely affect the skeletal muscle and recently it was demonstrated that changes in DNA methylation affects the gene expression in skeletal muscle that in part can explain their metabolic abnormalities. The objective of this work was to combine gene expression array data from different datasets to improve statistical power and thereby identify novel biomarkers that can be further explored. In this narrative review, we performed a meta-analysis of skeletal muscle arrays available from Gene Expression Omnibus and from publications. The eligibility criteria were published articles in English, and baseline (no treatment) skeletal muscle samples from women with PCOS and controls. The R package Metafor was used for integration of the datasets. One hundred and fourteen unique transcripts were differentially expressed in skeletal muscle from women with PCOS vs. controls (q < 0.05), 87% of these transcripts have not been previously identified as altered in PCOS muscle. ING2, CDKAL1, and AKTIP had the largest differential increase in expression, and TSHZ2, FKBP2, and OCEL1 had the largest decrease in expression. Two genes, IRX3 and CDKAL1 were consistently upregulated (q < 0.05) in the individual analyses and meta-analysis. Based on the meta-analysis, we identified several dysregulated immunometabolic pathways as a part of the molecular mechanisms of insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle of women with PCOS. The transcriptomic data need to be verified by functional analyses as well as proteomics to advance our understanding of PCOS specific insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.","Manti, MariaStener-Victorin, ElisabetBenrick, Anna","Manti MStener-Victorin EBenrick A","Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.Department of Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.School of Health Sciences, University of Skövde, Skövde, Sweden.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleSystematic Review","20201022","Switzerland","Front Physiol","Frontiers in physiology","101549006",NA,NA,NA,"PMC7642984",NA,"NOTNLM","PCOSgene expressionimmunometabolismmeta-analysisskeletal muscletranscriptomics",NA,"2020/11/17 06:00","2020/11/17 06:01","2020/10/22","2020/11/16 08:44","2020/06/17 00:00 [received]2020/09/25 00:00 [accepted]2020/11/16 08:44 [entrez]2020/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]2020/11/17 06:01 [medline]2020/10/22 00:00 [pmc-release]","10.3389/fphys.2020.573505 [doi]","epublish","Front Physiol. 2020 Oct 22;11:573505. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2020.573505. eCollection 2020.","Copyright © 2020 Manti, Stener-Victorin and Benrick.",NA,NA,"10.3389/fphys.2020.573505",NA,2020

Early diagnosis of NAFLD is important, as this can help prevent irreversible damage to the liver and, ultimately, hepatocellular carcinomas. We sought to expand etiological understanding and develop a diagnostic tool for NAFLD using machine learning. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We utilized the baseline data from IMI DIRECT, a multicenter prospective cohort study of 3,029 European-ancestry adults recently diagnosed with T2D (n = 795) or at high risk of developing the disease (n = 2,234). Multi-omics (genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) and clinical (liver enzymes and other serological biomarkers, anthropometry, measures of beta-cell function, insulin sensitivity, and lifestyle) data comprised the key input variables. The models were trained on MRI-image-derived liver fat content (<5% or ≥5%) available for 1,514 participants. We applied LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) to select features from the different layers of omics data and random forest analysis to develop the models. The prediction models included clinical and omics variables separately or in combination. A model including all omics and clinical variables yielded a cross-validated receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROCAUC) of 0.84 (95% CI 0.82, 0.86; p < 0.001), which compared with a ROCAUC of 0.82 (95% CI 0.81, 0.83; p < 0.001) for a model including 9 clinically accessible variables. The IMI DIRECT prediction models outperformed existing noninvasive NAFLD prediction tools. One limitation is that these analyses were performed in adults of European ancestry residing in northern Europe, and it is unknown how well these findings will translate to people of other ancestries and exposed to environmental risk factors that differ from those of the present cohort. Another key limitation of this study is that the prediction was done on a binary outcome of liver fat quantity (<5% or ≥5%) rather than a continuous one. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed several models with different combinations of clinical and omics data and identified biological features that appear to be associated with liver fat accumulation. In general, the clinical variables showed better prediction ability than the complex omics variables. However, the combination of omics and clinical variables yielded the highest accuracy. We have incorporated the developed clinical models into a web interface (see: https://www.predictliverfat.org/) and made it available to the community.

Specifically, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) activation protected insulin-deficient diabetic mice from hyperglycemia-induced glomerular pathology. This study aims to extend these findings in a separate cohort of individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and discover new circulatory biomarkers for renal protection through proteomics and metabolomics of Medalists' plasma. We hypothesize that increased glycolytic flux and improved mitochondrial biogenesis will halt the progression of diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Immunoblots analyzed selected glycolytic and mitochondrial enzymes in postmortem glomeruli of non-Medalists with type 1 diabetes (n = 15), type 2 diabetes (n = 19), and no diabetes (n = 5). Plasma proteomic (SOMAscan) (n = 180) and metabolomic screens (n = 214) of Medalists with and without stage 3b chronic kidney disease (CKD) were conducted and significant markers validated by ELISA. RESULTS: Glycolytic (PKM1, PKM2, and ENO1) and mitochondrial (MTCO2) enzymes were significantly elevated in glomeruli of CKD versus CKD+ individuals with type 2 diabetes. Medalists' plasma PKM2 correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (r (2) = 0.077; P = 0.0002). Several glucose and mitochondrial enzymes in circulation were upregulated with corresponding downregulation of toxic metabolites in CKD-protected Medalists. Amyloid precursor protein was also significantly upregulated, tumor necrosis factor receptors downregulated, and both confirmed by ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of enzymes involved in the metabolism of intracellular free glucose and its metabolites in renal glomeruli is connected to preserving kidney function in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The renal profile of elevated glycolytic enzymes and reduced toxic glucose metabolites is reflected in the circulation, supporting their use as biomarkers for endogenous renal protective factors in people with diabetes.","Gordin, DanielShah, HetalShinjo, TakanoriSt-Louis, RonaldQi, WeierPark, KyoungminPaniagua, Samantha MPober, David MWu, I-HsienBahnam, VanessaBrissett, Megan JTinsley, Liane JDreyfuss, Jonathan MPan, HuiDong, YutongNiewczas, Monika AAmenta, PeterSadowski, ThorstenKannt, AimoKeenan, Hillary AKing, George L","Gordin DShah HAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-3685-4572Shinjo TSt-Louis RQi WPark KPaniagua SMPober DMWu IHBahnam VBrissett MJTinsley LJDreyfuss JMPan HDong YNiewczas MAAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-2371-595XAmenta PSadowski TKannt AKeenan HAAUID ORCID: 0000-0003-4172-5537King GLAUID ORCID: 0000-0002-0335-5881","Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.Folkhälsan Research Center, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.Abdominal Center Nephrology, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.Translational Research and Early Clinical Development, Cardiovascular and Metabolic Research, AstraZeneca, Mölndal, Sweden.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.Sanofi Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.Sanofi Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.Medical Faculty Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA.Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.Sanofi-Genzyme, Cambridge, MA.Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA george.king@joslin.harvard.edu.Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.","eng","DP3 DK094333/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesT32 DK007260/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesP30 DK036836/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR24 DK083957/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesDP3 DK112192/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesUL1 RR025758/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20190510","United States","Diabetes Care","Diabetes care","7805975","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Enzymes)EC 2.7.1.40 (Pyruvate Kinase)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IM","AgedAged, 80 and overAutopsyBiomarkers/bloodCase-Control StudiesCohort StudiesDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1/blood/*complications/metabolism/pathologyDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*complications/metabolism/pathologyDiabetic Nephropathies/blood/*metabolism/pathologyDisease ProgressionEnzymes/analysis/*metabolismFemaleGlomerular Filtration RateGlucose/*metabolismHumansKidney/metabolism/pathology/physiopathologyKidney Glomerulus/metabolism/pathology/physiopathologyMaleMetabolic Networks and Pathways/physiologyMetabolomics/methodsMiddle AgedMitochondria/metabolismProteomics/methodsPyruvate Kinase/*metabolismRenal Insufficiency, Chronic/complications/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology","PMC6609957",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2019/05/12 06:00","2020/03/21 06:00","2020/07/01","2019/05/12 06:00","2018/12/18 00:00 [received]2019/04/11 00:00 [accepted]2019/05/12 06:00 [pubmed]2020/03/21 06:00 [medline]2019/05/12 06:00 [entrez]2020/07/01 00:00 [pmc-release]","dc18-2585 [pii]2585 [pii]10.2337/dc18-2585 [doi]","ppublish","Diabetes Care. 2019 Jul;42(7):1263-1273. doi: 10.2337/dc18-2585.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of the unsaturated free fatty acid oleate in glucolipotoxicity and to unravel the molecular pathways involved. INS-1E cells were exposed to 0.5 mM oleate, combined or not with 25 mM glucose, for 24 h. Protein profiling of INS-1E cells was done by 2D-DIGE, covering pH ranges 4-7 and 6-9 (n = 4). Identification of differentially expressed proteins (P < 0.05) was based on MALDI-TOF analysis using Peptide Mass Fingerprint (PMF) and fragmentation (MS/MS) of the most intense peaks of PMF and proteomic results were confirmed by functional assays. Oleate impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and decreased insulin content. 2D-DIGE analysis revealed 53 and 54 differentially expressed proteins for oleate and the combination of oleate and high glucose, respectively. Exposure to oleate down-regulated chaperones, hampered insulin processing and ubiquitin-related proteasomal degradation, and induced perturbations in vesicle transport and budding. In combination with high glucose, shunting of excess amounts of glucose toward reactive oxygen species production worsened beta cell death. The present findings provide new insights in oleate-induced beta cell dysfunction and identify target proteins for preservation of functional beta cell mass in type 2 diabetes.","Maris, MichaelWaelkens, EtienneCnop, MiriamD'Hertog, WannesCunha, Daniel AKorf, HannelieKoike, TatsuroOverbergh, LutMathieu, Chantal","Maris MWaelkens ECnop MD'Hertog WCunha DAKorf HKoike TOverbergh LMathieu C","Laboratory for Experimental Medicine and Endocrinology (LEGENDO), Herestraat 49, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20110713","United States","J Proteome Res","Journal of proteome research","101128775","0 (DNA Primers)0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)0 (Insulin)0 (Lipids)0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)2UMI9U37CP (Oleic Acid)8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IM","Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolismAnimalsApoptosis/*drug effectsBase SequenceCell LineDNA PrimersElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-DimensionalFatty Acids, Unsaturated/*pharmacologyGlucose/*toxicityInsulin/metabolismInsulin SecretionIslets of Langerhans/*drug effects/metabolism/physiopathologyLipids/*toxicityOleic Acid/*pharmacologyPolymerase Chain Reaction*ProteomicsRatsReactive Oxygen Species/metabolismSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-IonizationTandem Mass Spectrometry",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2011/06/29 06:00","2012/01/04 06:00",NA,"2011/06/29 06:00","2011/06/29 06:00 [entrez]2011/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]","10.1021/pr101290n [doi]","ppublish","J Proteome Res. 2011 Aug 5;10(8):3372-85. doi: 10.1021/pr101290n.

Digital imaging analysis of the nanomechanics of individual exocytotic events, achieved using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, has allowed us to demonstrate that insulin is released via transient or 'cavicapture' events whereby the vesicle and plasma membranes fuse transiently and reversibly. Such studies reveal that an increase in the number of abortive fusion events contributes to defective insulin secretion in in vitro models of Type II diabetes. Complementary analyses of genome-wide changes in beta-cell gene expression, at both the mRNA and protein levels, are now facilitating the identification of key molecular players whose altered expression may contribute to the secretory defects in the diabetic beta-cell.","Rutter, G AVaradi, ATsuboi, TParton, LRavier, M","Rutter GAVaradi ATsuboi TParton LRavier M","Henry Wellcome Laboratories for Integrated Cell Signalling and Department of Biochemistry, School of Medical Sciences, University of Bristol, University Walk, Bristol BS8 1TD, UK. g.a.rutter@bris.ac.uk","eng","Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom","Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tReview",NA,"England","Biochem Soc Trans","Biochemical Society transactions","7506897","0 (Insulin)IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)","IM","AnimalsDiabetes Mellitus/genetics/*metabolismGenomicsGlucose/metabolism*HealthHumansInsulin/*metabolismInsulin SecretionProteomicsRF   43",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2006/03/21 09:00","2006/06/17 09:00",NA,"2006/03/21 09:00","2006/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]2006/06/17 09:00 [medline]2006/03/21 09:00 [entrez]","BST20060247 [pii]10.1042/BST20060247 [doi]","ppublish","Biochem Soc Trans. 2006 Apr;34(Pt 2):247-50. doi: 10.1042/BST20060247.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2006

Hypoxia in adipose tissue has been associated with altered adipokine secretion profile and suggested as a possible factor in the development of type 2 diabetes. In vitro experiments provide an indispensable tool in metabolic research, however, physical laws of gas diffusion make prolonged exposure of adherent cells to desired pericellular O2 concentrations questionable. The aim of this study was to investigate the direct effect of various O2 levels (1%, 4% and 20% O2) on the proteomic profile and triglyceride accumulation in 3T3-L1 differentiated preadipocytes using gas-permeable cultureware. Following differentiation of cells under desired pericellular O2 concentrations, cell lysates were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein visualization using Coomassie blue staining. Spots showing differential expression under hypoxia were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. All identified proteins were subjected to pathway analysis. We observed that protein expression of 26 spots was reproducibly affected by 4% and 1% O2 (17 upregulated and 9 downregulated). Pathway analysis showed that mitochondrial energy metabolism and triglyceride synthesis were significantly upregulated by hypoxia. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the direct effects of pericellular O2 levels on adipocyte energy metabolism and triglyceride synthesis, probably mediated through the reversed tricarboxylic acid cycle flux.","Weiszenstein, MartinPavlikova, NelaElkalaf, MoustafaHalada, PetrSeda, OndrejTrnka, JanKovar, JanPolak, Jan","Weiszenstein MPavlikova NElkalaf MHalada PSeda OTrnka JKovar JPolak J","Center for Research on Diabetes, Metabolism and Nutrition, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.Department of Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology-Division of Cell and Molecular Biology, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.Laboratory for Metabolism and Bioenergetics, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.Laboratory of Molecular Structure Characterization, Institute of Microbiology of the CAS, v.v.i., Prague, Czech Republic.Institute of Biology and Medical Genetics, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.Laboratory for Metabolism and Bioenergetics, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.Department of Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology-Division of Cell and Molecular Biology, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.Center for Research on Diabetes, Metabolism and Nutrition, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.Centre of Toxicology and Health Safety, The National Institute of Public Health, Prague, Czech Republic.2nd Internal Medicine Department, University Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady, Prague, Czech Republic.","eng",NA,"Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","20160329","United States","PLoS One","PloS one","101285081","0 (Gases)0 (Lipids)0 (Triglycerides)S88TT14065 (Oxygen)","IM","3T3-L1 CellsAdipocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolismAnimalsCell CountCell Differentiation/*drug effectsCells, CulturedCitric Acid Cycle/drug effectsDown-Regulation/drug effectsElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-DimensionalGases/*chemistryLipids/biosynthesisLipogenesis/*drug effectsMiceOxygen/*pharmacologyPermeability*ProteomicsSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-IonizationTriglycerides/metabolismUp-Regulation/drug effects","PMC4811553",NA,NA,NA,"Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.","2016/03/31 06:00","2016/08/30 06:00","2016/03/29","2016/03/30 06:00","2015/11/13 00:00 [received]2016/03/14 00:00 [accepted]2016/03/30 06:00 [entrez]2016/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]2016/08/30 06:00 [medline]2016/03/29 00:00 [pmc-release]","PONE-D-15-49652 [pii]10.1371/journal.pone.0152382 [doi]","epublish","PLoS One. 2016 Mar 29;11(3):e0152382. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0152382. eCollection 2016.",NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0152382",NA,2016

Functionally, these proteins represent innate immune responses, the activation cascade of complement, inflammatory responses, and blood coagulation. Targeted verification analyses were performed on 52 surrogate peptides representing these proteins, with serum samples from an antibody standardization program cohort of 100 healthy control and 50 type 1 diabetic subjects. 16 peptides were verified as having very good discriminating power, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve ≥ 0.8. Further validation with blinded serum samples from an independent cohort (10 healthy control and 10 type 1 diabetics) demonstrated that peptides from platelet basic protein and C1 inhibitor achieved both 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for classification of samples. The disease specificity of these proteins was assessed using sera from 50 age-matched type 2 diabetic individuals, and a subset of proteins, C1 inhibitor in particular, were exceptionally good discriminators between these two forms of diabetes. The panel of biomarkers distinguishing those with T1D from healthy controls and those with type 2 diabetes suggests that dysregulated innate immune responses may be associated with the development of this disorder.","Zhang, QibinFillmore, Thomas LSchepmoes, Athena AClauss, Therese R WGritsenko, Marina AMueller, Patricia WRewers, MarianAtkinson, Mark ASmith, Richard DMetz, Thomas O","Zhang QFillmore TLSchepmoes AAClauss TRGritsenko MAMueller PWRewers MAtkinson MASmith RDMetz TO","Biological Sciences Division and the 2 Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99354, USA. qibin.zhang@pnnl.gov","eng","P30 DK057516/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesDK32083/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesP30 DK57516/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesP41GM103493/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United StatesR37 DK032083/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR01 DK032493/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesDK070146/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesR21 DK070146/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesP41 GM103493/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United StatesR01 DK032083/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesP41 RR018522/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesR33 DK070146/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United StatesP41RR018522/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States","Journal ArticleResearch Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralResearch Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","20121231","United States","J Exp Med","The Journal of experimental medicine","2985109R","0 (Biomarkers)0 (Blood Proteins)0 (Complement C1 Inactivator Proteins)0 (Complement C1 Inhibitor Protein)0 (SERPING1 protein, human)","IM","Amino Acid SequenceBiomarkers/bloodBlood Proteins/*analysisCase-Control StudiesChromatography, Liquid/methodsComplement C1 Inactivator Proteins/analysisComplement C1 Inhibitor ProteinDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1/blood/*immunologyDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/complicationsHumansHyperglycemia/blood/etiology*Immunity, InnateMass Spectrometry/methodsMolecular Sequence DataPredictive Value of TestsProteomics/*methodsROC CurveReference ValuesReproducibility of ResultsSensitivity and Specificity","PMC3549705",NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013/01/02 06:00","2013/04/13 06:00","2013/07/14","2013/01/02 06:00","2013/01/02 06:00 [entrez]2013/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]2013/04/13 06:00 [medline]2013/07/14 00:00 [pmc-release]","jem.20111843 [pii]20111843 [pii]10.1084/jem.20111843 [doi]","ppublish","J Exp Med. 2013 Jan 14;210(1):191-203. doi: 10.1084/jem.20111843.
